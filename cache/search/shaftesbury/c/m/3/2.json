If these Countrys had been as bare of those Metals as old Sparta, we might have heard more perhaps of the Peru' s and Mexico' s than of all Asia and Africa.

Instead of being incited by such a historical Account of Meats, you wou'd be apt, I believe, to have less Appetite, the more you search'd their Origin, and descended into the Kitchin-Science, to learn the several Forms and Changes they had undergone, ere they were serv'd at this elegant voluptuous Table. But tho the Kitchin-Forms be ever so disgraceful, you will allow that the Materials of the Kitchin, such, for instance, as the Garden furnishes, are really fair and beautiful in their kind. Nor will you deny Beauty to the wild Field, or to these Flowers which grow around us, on this verdant Couch. And yet, as lovely as are these Forms of Nature, the shining Grass, or silver'd Moss, the flowry Thyme, wild Rose, or Honey-suckle: 'tis not their Beauty allures the neighbouring Herds, delights the brouzing Fawn, or Kid, and spreads the Joy we see amidst the feeding Flocks: 'Tis not the Form rejoices; but that which is beneath the Form: 'tis Savouriness attracts, Hunger impels; and Thirst, better allay'd by the clear Brook than the thick Puddle, makes the fair Nymph to be prefer'd, whose Form is otherwise slighted. For never can the Form be of real force where it is uncontemplated, unjudg'd of, unexamin'd, and stands only as the accidental Note or Token of what appeases provok'd Sense, and satisfies the brutish Part.

His Ability or Incompetency, his Power of Enjoyment, or his Impotence, is founded in this alone. As this is sound, fair, noble, worthy; so are its Subjects, Acts and Employments. For as the riotous Mind, captive to Sense, can never enter in competition, or contend for Beauty with the virtuous Mind of Reason's Culture; {Comparison of Objects,} so neither can the Objects which allure the former, compare with those which attract and charm the latter. And when each gratifies it-self in the Enjoyment and Possession of its Object; {and Enjoyments.} how evidently fairer are the Acts which join the latter Pair, and give a Soul the Enjoyment of what is generous and good? This at least, Philocles, you will surely allow, That when you place a Joy elsewhere than in the Mind; the Enjoyment it-self will be no beautiful Subject, nor of any graceful or agreeable Appearance. But when you think how Friendship is enjoy'd, how Honour, Gratitude, Candour, Benignity, and all internal Beauty; how all the social Pleasures, Society it-self, and all which constitutes the Worth and Happiness of Mankind; you will here surely allow Beauty in the Act, and think it worthy to be view'd, and pass'd in review often by the glad Mind, happily conscious of the generous Part, and of its own Advancement and Growth in Beauty.","subId":"56","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.3.2.56"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Recapitulation.} THUS, Philocles, (continu'd he, after a short Pause) thus have I presum'd to treat of Beauty before so great a Judg, and such a skilful Admirer as your-self. For taking rise from Nature's Beauty, which transported me, I gladly ventur'd further in the Chase; and have accompany'd you in search of Beauty, as it relates to us, and makes our highest Good, in its sincere and natural Enjoyment. And if we have not idly spent our hours, nor rang'd in vain thro' these deserted Regions; it shou'd appear from our strict Search, that there is nothing so divine as Beauty: which belonging not to Body, nor having any Principle or Existence except in Mind and Reason, is alone discover'd and acquir'd by this diviner Part, when it inspects it-self, the only Object worthy of it-self. For whate'er is void of Mind, is Void and Darkness to the Mind's Eye. This languishes and grows dim, whene'er detain'd on foreign Subjects; but thrives and attains its natural Vigour, when employ'd in Contemplation of what is like it-self. 'Tis thus the improving Mind, slightly surveying other Objects, and passing over Bodys, and the common Forms, (where only a Shadow of Beauty rests) ambitiously presses onward to its Source, and views the Original of Form and Order in that which is intelligent. And thus, OPhilocles! may we improve and become Artists in the kind; learning \"To know Our-selves, and what That is, which by improving, we may be sure to advance our Worth, and real Self-Interest.\" For neither is this Knowledg acquir'd by Contemplation of Bodys, or the outward Forms, {Knowledg of our-selves.} the View of Pageantrys, the Study of Estates and Honours: nor is He to be esteem'd that self-improving Artist, who makes a Fortune out of these; but he, He only, is the wise and able Man, who with a slight regard to these Things, applies himself to cultivate another Soil, builds in a different Matter from that of Stone or Marble; and having righter Models in his Eye, {Interest.} becomes in truth the Architect of his own Life and Fortune; by laying within himself the lasting and sure Foundations of Order, Peace, {Ability.} and Concord.—But now 'tis time to think of returning home.
