Election is purposing to do an Action rather than its contrary, or than being inactive. Approbation of our own Action denotes, or is attended with, a Pleasure in the Contemplation of it, and in Reflection upon the Affections which inclined us to it. Approbation of the Action of another has some little Pleasure attending it in the Observer, and raises Love toward the Agent, in whom the Quality approved is deemed to reside, and not in the Observer, who has a Satisfaction in the Act of approving.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Qualities moving to Election, or exciting to Action, are different from those moving to Approbation: We often do Actions which we do not approve, and approve Actions which we omit: We often desire that an Agent had omitted an Action which we approve; and wish he would do an Action which we condemn.

And that, in like manner, what determines any Agent to approve his own Action, is its Tendency to his private Happiness in the whole, tho' it may bring present Pain along with it: That the Approbation of the Action of another, is from an Opinion of its Tendency to the Happiness of the Approver, either immediately or more remotely: That each Agent may discover it to be the surest way to promote his private Happiness, to do publickly useful Actions, and to abstain from those which are publickly hurtful: That the neglecting to observe this, and doing publickly hurtful Actions, does mischief to the whole of Mankind, by hurting any one part; that every one has some little damage by this Action: Such an inadvertent Person might possibly be pernicious to any one, were he in his Neighbourhood; and the very Example of such Actions may extend over the whole World, and produce some pernicious Effects upon any Observer. That therefore every one may look upon such Actions as hurtful to himself, and in this view does disapprove them, and hates the Agent. In the like manner, a publickly useful Action may diffuse some small Advantage to every Observer, whence he may approve it, and love the Agent.\"","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Does not answer the Appearances.} This Scheme can never account for the principal Actions of human Life: Such as the Offices of Friendship, Gratitude, natural Affection, Generosity, publick Spirit, Compassion. Men are conscious of no such Intentions or acute Reflections about these Actions. Ingenious speculative Men, in their straining to support an Hypothesis, may contrive a thousand subtle selfish Motives, which a kind generous Heart never dreamed of. In like manner, this Scheme can never account for the sudden Approbation, and violent Sense of something amiable in Actions done in distant Ages and Nations, while the Approver has perhaps never thought of these distant Tendencies to his Happiness. Nor will it better account for our want of Approbation toward publickly useful Actions done casually, or only with Intention of private Happiness to the Agent. And then, in these Actions reputed generous, if the Agent's Motive was only a view to his own Pleasure, how come we to approve them more than his enriching himself, or his gratifying his own Taste with good Food? The whole Species may receive a like Advantage from both, and the Observer an equal Share.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Were our Approbation of Actions done in distant Ages and Nations, occasioned by this Thought, that such an Action done toward ourselves would be useful to us, why do not we approve and love in like manner, any Man who finds a Treasure, or indulges himself in any exquisite Sensation, since these Advantages or Pleasures might have been conferred on ourselves; and tend more to our Happiness than any Actions in distant Ages?","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Sanctions of Laws may make any Agent chuse the Action required, under the Conception of useful to himself, and lead him into an Opinion of private Advantage in it, and of detriment in the contrary Actions; but what should determine any Person to approve the Actions of others, because of a Conformity to a Law, if Approbation in any Person were only an Opinion of private Advantage?","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{The opposite Opinion does plainly.} The other Opinion is this, \"That we have not only Self‐Love, but benevolent Affections also toward others, in various Degrees, making us desire their Happiness as an ultimate End, without any view to private Happiness: That we have a moral Sense or Determination of our Mind, to approve every kind Affection either in ourselves or others, and all publickly useful Actions which we imagine flow from such Affection, without our having a view to our private Happiness, in our Approbation of these Actions.\"","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.Intro.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These two Opinions seem both intelligible, each consistent with itself.
