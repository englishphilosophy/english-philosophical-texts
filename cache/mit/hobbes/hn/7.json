Nor is there any such Thing as Absolute Goodness, considered without Relation: for even the Goodness which we apprehend in God Almighty, is _his Goodness to us._ And as we call _Good_ and _Evil_ the _Things_ that please and displease; so call we _Goodness_ and _Badness,_ the _Qualities_ or Powers whereby they do it: And the Signs of that Goodness are called by the _Latines_ in one Word _Pulchritudo,_ and the Signs of Evil, _Turpitudo_; to which we have no Words precisely answerable.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.7.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As all Conceptions we have immediately by the _Sense,_ are, _Delight,_ or _Pain,_ or _Appetite,_ or _Fear_; so are all the _Imaginations_ after Sense.

But for an _utmost_ End, in which the ancient _Philosophers_ have placed _Felicity,_ and disputed much concerning the Way thereto, there is no such Thing in this World, nor Way to it, more than to _Vtopia_: for while we live, we have Desires, and Desire presupposeth a further End. Those Things which please us, as the Way or _Means_ to a further End, we call _profitable_; and the _Fruition_ of them, _Vse_; and those Things that profit not, _vain._","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.7.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Seeing all _Delight_ is _Appetite,_ and presupposeth a _further_ End, there can be _no Contentment_ but in _proceeding_: and therefore we are not to marvel, when we see, that as Men attain to more Riches, Honour, or other Power; so their Appetite continually groweth more and more; and when they are come to the utmost Degree of some Kind of Power, they pursue some other, as long as in any Kind they think themselves behind any other: of those therefore that have attained to the highest Degree of Honour and Riches, some have affected Mastery in some Art; as _Nero_ in Musick and Poetry, _Commodus_ in the Art of a Gladiator; and such as affect not some such Thing, must find Diversion and Recreation of their Thoughts in the Contention either of Play or Business: and Men justly complain of a great Grief, that they know not what to do. _Felicity_ therefore, by which we mean continual Delight, consisteth _not_ in _having_ prospered, but in _prospering._","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.7.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are few Things in this World, but _either_ have _Mixture_ of Good and Evil, _or_ there is a Chain of them so necessarily linked together, that the one cannot be taken without the other: As for Example, the Pleasures of Sin, and the Bitterness of Punishment, are inseparable; as is also Labour and Honour, for the most part.
