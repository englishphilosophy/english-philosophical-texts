Because of the sensitive nature of the text, however, he did not publish it in his lifetime, but left instructions to his nephew to publish it after his death. It was printed in 1779, and this edition is naturally our copytext. Fortunately, however, Hume’s own manuscript for the work survives. This manuscript was consulted in drawing up the critical text provided here.","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£1 PART VI. £1","id":"Hume.DNR.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^It^ must be a slight fabric, indeed, said ^=Demea=^, which can be erected on so tottering a foundation. While we are uncertain, whether there is one deity or many; whether the deity or deities, to whom we owe our existence, be perfect or imperfect, subordinate or supreme, dead or alive; what trust or confidence can we repose in them? What devotion or worship address to them? What veneration or obedience pay them? To all the purposes of life, the theory of religion becomes altogether useless: and even with regard to speculative consequences, its uncertainty, according to you, must render it totally precarious and unsatisfactory.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.DNR.6.1","pages":"170"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To render it still more unsatisfactory, said ^=Philo=^, there occurs to me another hypothesis, which must acquire an air of probability from the method of reasoning so much insisted on by ^=Cleanthes=^. That like effects arise from like causes: this principle he supposes the foundation of all religion. But there is another principle of the same kind, no less certain, and derived from the same source of experience; That where several known circumstances are observed to be similar, the unknown will also be found similar. Thus, if we see the limbs of a human body, we conclude, that it is also attended with a human head, though hid from us. Thus, if we see, through a chink in a wall, a small part of the sun, we conclude, that, were the wall removed, we should see the whole body. In short, this method of reasoning is so obvious and familiar, that no scruple can ever be made with regard to its solidity.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.DNR.6.2","pages":"170"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now if we survey the universe, so far as it falls under our knowledge, it bears a great resemblance to an animal or organized body, and seems actuated with a like principle of life and motion. A continual circulation of matter in it produces no disorder: a continual waste in every part is incessantly |repaired: the closest sympathy is perceived throughout the entire system: and each part or member, in performing its proper offices, operates both to its own preservation and to that of the whole. The world, therefore, I infer, is an animal, and the Deity is the SOUL of the world, actuating it, and actuated by it.","subId":"3","id":"Hume.DNR.6.3","pages":"170-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"You have too much learning, ^=Cleanthes=^, to be at all surprised at this opinion, which, you know, was maintained by almost all the Theists of antiquity, and chiefly prevails in their discourses and reasonings. For though sometimes the ancient philosophers reason from final causes, as if they thought the world the workmanship of God; yet it appears rather their favorite notion to consider it as his body, whose organization renders it subservient to him. And it must be confessed, that as the universe resembles more a human body than it does the works of human art and contrivance; if our limited analogy could ever, with any propriety, be extended to the whole of nature, the inference seems juster in favour of the ancient than the modern theory.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.DNR.6.4","pages":"171"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are many other advantages too, in the former theory, which recommended it to the ancient Theologians. Nothing more repugnant to all their notions, because nothing more repugnant to common experience, than mind without body; a mere spiritual substance, which fell not under their senses nor comprehension, and of which they had not observed one single instance throughout all nature. Mind and body they knew, because they felt both: an order, arrangement, organization, or internal machinery in both they likewise knew, after the same manner: and it could not but seem reasonable to transfer this experience to the universe, and to suppose the divine mind and body to be also coeval, and to have, both of them, order and arrangement naturally inherent in them, and inseparable from them.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.DNR.6.5","pages":"171"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here therefore is a new species of _Anthropomorphism_, ^=Cleanthes=^, on which you may deliberate; and a theory which seems not liable to any considerable difficulties. You are too much superior surely to _systematical prejudices_, to find any more difficulty in supposing an animal body to be, originally, of itself, or from unknown causes, possessed of order and organization, than in supposing a similar order to belong to |mind. But the _vulgar prejudice_, that body and mind ought always to accompany each other, ought not, one should think, to be entirely neglected; since it is founded on _vulgar experience_, the only guide which you profess to follow in all these theological enquiries. And if you assert, that our limited experience is an unequal standard, by which to judge of the unlimited extent of nature; you entirely abandon your own hypothesis, and must thenceforward adopt our Mysticism, as you call it, and admit of the absolute incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature.","subId":"6","id":"Hume.DNR.6.6","pages":"171-2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This theory, I own, replied ^=Cleanthes=^, has never before occurred to me, though a pretty natural one; and I cannot readily, upon so short an examination and reflection, deliver any opinion with regard to it. You are very scrupulous, indeed, said ^=Philo=^; were I to examine any system of yours, I should not have acted with half that caution and reserve, in starting objections and difficulties to it. However, if any thing occur to you, you will oblige us by proposing it.","subId":"7","id":"Hume.DNR.6.7","pages":"172"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Why then, replied ^=Cleanthes=^, it seems to me, that, though the world does, in many circumstances, resemble an animal body; yet is the analogy also defective in many circumstances, the most material: no organs of sense; no seat of thought or reason; no one precise origin of motion and action. In short, it seems to bear a stronger resemblance to a vegetable than to an animal, and your inference would be so far inconclusive in favour of the soul of the world.","subId":"8","id":"Hume.DNR.6.8","pages":"172"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But in the next place, your theory seems to imply the eternity of the world; and that is a principle, which, I think, can be refuted by the strongest reasons and probabilities. I shall suggest an argument to this purpose, which, I believe, has not been insisted on by any writer. Those, who reason from the late origin of arts and sciences, though their inference wants not force, may perhaps be refuted by considerations, derived from the nature of human society, which is in continual revolution, between ignorance and knowledge, liberty and slavery, riches and poverty; so that it is impossible for us, from our limited experience, to foretell with assurance what events may or may not be expected. Ancient learning and history seem to have been in great danger of entirely perishing |after the inundation of the barbarous nations; and had these convulsions continued a little longer, or been a little more violent, we should not probably have now known what passed in the world a few centuries before us. Nay, were it not for the superstition of the Popes, who preserved a little jargon of ^Latin^, in order to support the appearance of an ancient and universal church, that tongue must have been utterly lost: in which case, the Western world, being totally barbarous, would not have been in a fit disposition for receiving the ^Greek^ language and learning, which was conveyed to them after the sacking of ^Constantinople^. When learning and books had been extinguished, even the mechanical arts would have fallen considerably to decay; and it is easily imagined, that fable or tradition might ascribe to them a much later origin than the true one. This vulgar argument, therefore, against the eternity of the world, seems a little precarious.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.DNR.6.9","pages":"172-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But here appears to be the foundation of a better argument. ^=Lucullus=^ was the first that brought cherry-trees from ^Asia^ to ^Europe^; though that tree thrives so well in many ^European^ climates, that it grows in the woods without any culture. Is it possible, that, throughout a whole eternity, no ^European^ had ever passed into ^Asia^, and thought of transplanting so delicious a fruit into his own country? Or if the tree was once transplanted and propagated, how could it ever afterwards perish? Empires may rise and fall; liberty and slavery succeed alternately; ignorance and knowledge give place to each other; but the cherry-tree will still remain in the woods of ^Greece^, ^Spain^ and ^Italy^, and will never be affected by the revolutions of human society.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.DNR.6.10","pages":"173"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is not two thousand years since vines were transplanted into ^France^; though there is no climate in the world more favourable to them. It is not three centuries since horses, cows, sheep, swine, dogs, corn were known in ^America^. Is it possible, that, during the revolutions of a whole eternity, there never arose a ^=Columbus=^, who might open the communication between ^Europe^ and that continent? We may as well imagine, that all men would wear stockings for ten thousand years, and never have the sense to think of garters to tie them. All these seem convincing proofs of the youth, or rather infancy of the world; as being founded on the operation of principles more |constant and steady, than those by which human society is governed and directed. Nothing less than a total convulsion of the elements will ever destroy all the ^European^ animals and vegetables, which are now to be found in the Western world.","subId":"11","id":"Hume.DNR.6.11","pages":"173-4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And what argument have you against such convulsions? replied ^=Philo=^. Strong and almost incontestable proofs may be traced over the whole earth, that every part of this globe has continued for many ages entirely covered with water. And though order were supposed inseparable from matter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be susceptible of many and great revolutions, through the endless periods of eternal duration. The incessant changes, to which every part of it is subject, seem to intimate some such general transformations; though at the same time, it is observable, that all the changes and corruptions, of which we have ever had experience, are but passages from one state of order to another; nor can matter ever rest in total deformity and confusion. What we see in the parts, we may infer in the whole; at least, that is the method of reasoning, on which you rest your whole theory. And were I obliged to defend any particular system of this nature (which I never willingly should do) I esteem none more plausible, than that which ascribes an eternal, inherent principle of order to the world; though attended with great and continual revolutions and alterations. This at once solves all difficulties; and if the solution, by being so general, is not entirely complete and satisfactory, it is, at least, a theory, that we must, sooner or later, have recourse to, whatever system we embrace. How could things have been as they are, were there not an original, inherent principle of order somewhere, in thought or in matter? And it is very indifferent to which of these we give the preference. Chance has no place, on any hypothesis, sceptical or religious. Every thing is surely governed by steady, inviolable laws. And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us, we should then discover a scene, of |which, at present, we can have no idea. Instead of admiring the order of natural beings, we should clearly see, that it was absolutely impossible for them, in the smallest article, ever to admit of any other disposition.","subId":"12","id":"Hume.DNR.6.12","pages":"174-5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Were any one inclined to revive the ancient Pagan Theology, which maintained, as we learn from {~~=Hesiod=->^=Hesiod=^~~}, that this globe was governed by 30,000 deities, who arose from the unknown powers of nature: you would naturally object, ^=Cleanthes=^, that nothing is gained by this hypothesis; and that it is as easy to suppose all men and animals, beings more numerous, but less perfect, to have sprung immediately from a like origin. Push the same inference a step farther; and you will find a numerous society of deities as explicable as one universal deity, who possesses, within himself, the powers and perfections of the whole society. All these systems, then, of Scepticism, Polytheism, and Theism, you must allow, on your principles, to be on a like footing, and that no one of them has any advantages over the others. You may thence learn the fallacy of your principles.","subId":"13","id":"Hume.DNR.6.13","pages":"175"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hume","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":1739,"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hume.THN","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Treatise of Human Nature","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1739,1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise"},{"id":"Hume.A","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"An Abstract of a Book Lately Published","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Abstract"},{"id":"Hume.EWU","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1741,1742,1756],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished"},{"id":"Hume.LG","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1745],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Letter from a Gentleman"},{"id":"Hume.ETSS","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1758],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays and Treatises"},{"id":"Hume.HE","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"The History of England","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1754,1757,1759,1762],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"History of England"},{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"My Own Life"},{"id":"Hume.DNR","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1779],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues"}]},{"id":"Hume.DNR","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1779],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues"}],"prev":{"id":"Hume.DNR.5","imported":true,"title":"Part 5","breadcrumb":"Part 5","published":[1779]},"next":{"id":"Hume.DNR.7","imported":true,"title":"Part 7","breadcrumb":"Part 7","published":[1779]}}
