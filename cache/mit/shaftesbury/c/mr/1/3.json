The first Censure of this kind which came to our Author's sight, was that of the ^Paris^[n1] _Journal des Savans._ Considering how little favourable the Author of the Letter had shewn himself towards the _Romish_ Church, and Policy of ^France,^ it must be own'd those Journalists have treated him with sufficient Candor: tho they fail'd not to take what Advantages they well cou'd against the Writing, and particularly arraign'd it for the want[n2] of Order and Method.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Protestant Writers, such as live in a free Country, and can deliver their Sentiments without Constraint, have certainly[n3] done our Author more Honour than he ever presum'd to think he cou'd deserve. His _Translator_ indeed, who had done him the previous Honour of introducing him to the Acquaintance of the foreign World, represents particularly, by the Turn given to the latter end of the Letter, that the Writer of it was, as to his Condition and Rank, little better than an inferior Dependent on the noble Lord to whom he had address'd himself. And in reality the _Original_ has so much of that air; that I wonder not, if what the Author left ambiguous, the Translator has determin'd to the side of _Clientship_ and _Dependency._","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But whatever may have been the Circumstance or Character of our Author himself; that of his _great_ Friend ought in justice to have been consider'd by those former Criticks above-mention'd. So much, at least, shou'd have been taken notice of, that there was _a real_ ^greatMan^ characteriz'd, and sutable Measures of Address and Style preserv'd. But they who wou'd neither observe this, nor apprehend the Letter it-self to be _real,_ were insufficient Criticks, and unqualify'd to judg of the Turn or Humour of a Piece, which they had never consider'd in a proper light.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis become indeed so common a Practice among Authors, to feign a Correspondency, and give the Title of _a private Letter_ to a Piece address'd solely to the _Publick,_ that it wou'd not be strange to see other _Journalists_ and _Criticks,_ as well as the Gentlemen of ^Paris,^ pass over such Particularitys, as things of Form. This Prejudice however cou'd not misguide a chief Critick of the Protestant side; when[n4] mentioning this _Letter concerning Enthusiasm,_ he speaks of it as a real _Letter,_ (such as in truth it was) not a precise and formal[n5] ^Treatise,^ design'd for _publick_ View.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It will be own'd surely, by those who have learnt to judg of Elegancy and Wit by the help merely of modern Languages, That we cou'd have little Relish of the best _Letters_ of a ^Balsac^ or ^Voiture,^ were we wholly ignorant of the _Characters_ of the principal Persons to whom those _Letters_ were actually written. But much less cou'd we find pleasure in this reading, shou'd we take it into our heads, that both the Personages and Correspondency it-self were merely fictitious. Let the best of ^Tully'^ s Epistles be read in such a narrow View as this, and they will certainly prove very insipid. If a real ^Brutus,^ a real ^Atticus^ be not suppos'd, there will be no real ^Cicero.^ The elegant Writer will disappear: as will the vast Labour and Art with which this eloquent _Roman_ writ those Letters to his illustrious Friends. There was no kind of Composition in which this great Author prided or pleas'd himself more than in this; where he endeavour'd to throw off the Mein of _the Philosopher_ and _Orator,_ whilst in effect he employ'd both his Rhetorick and Philosophy with the greatest Force. They who can read an _Epistle_ or _Satir_ of ^Horace^ in somewhat better than a mere scholastick Relish, will comprehend that _the Concealment of Order_ and _Method,_ in this manner of Writing, makes the chief Beauty of the Work. They will own, that unless a Reader be in some measure appriz'd of the Characters of an ^Augustus,^ a ^Maecenas,^ a ^Florus,^ or a ^Trebatius,^ there will be little Relish in those _Satirs_ or _Epistles_ address'd in particular to the Courtiers, Ministers, and Great Men of the Times. Even the ^Satirick,^ or ^Miscellaneous^ _Manner_ of the polite Antients, requir'd as much _Order_ as the most regular Pieces. But the _Art_ was to destroy every such Token or Appearance, give an _extemporary_ Air to what was writ, and make the _Effect_ of Art be felt, without discovering the _Artifice._ There needs no further Explanation on this Head. Our Author himself has said enough in his[n6] _Advice to an Author,_ particularly where he treats of the _simple_ Style, in contra-distinction to the _learned,_ the _formal,_ or _methodick._","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis a different Case indeed, when the Title of _Epistle_ is improperly given to such Works as were never writ in any other view than that of being made publick, or to serve as Exercises or Specimens of the Wit of their Composer. Such were those infinite Numbers of _Greek_ and _Latin_ Epistles, writ by the antient _Sophists, Grammarians,_ or _Rhetoricians;_ where we find the real Character of _the Epistle,_ the genuine Style and Manners of the corresponding Partys sometimes imitated; but at other times not so much as aim'd at, nor any Measures of _historical Truth_ preserv'd. Such perhaps we may esteem even the Letters of a[n7] ^Seneca^ to his Friend ^Lucilius.^ Or supposing that philosophical Courtier had really such a Correspondency; and, at several times, had sent so many fair Epistles, honestly sign'd and seal'd, to his Country-friend at a distance; it appears however by the Epistles themselves, in their proper _Order,_ (if they may be said to have any) that after a few Attempts at the beginning, the Author by degrees loses sight of his Correspondent, and takes the _World_ in general for his Reader or Disciple. He falls into the random way of _Miscellaneous_ Writing; says every-where great and noble Things, in and out of the way, accidentally as _Words_ led him (for with these he plays perpetually); with infinite Wit, but with little or no Coherence; without a Shape or Body to his Work; without a real[n8] _Beginning,_ a _Middle,_ or an _End._ Of _a hundred and twenty four_ Epistles, you may, if you please, make _five Hundred,_ or _half a Score._ A great-one, for instance, you may divide into _five_ or _six._ A little-one you may tack to another; and that to another; and so on. The Unity of the Writing will be the same: The Life and Spirit full as well preserv'd. 'Tis not only _whole Letters_ or _Pages_ you may change and manage thus at pleasure: Every _Period,_ every _Sentence_ almost, is independent; and may be taken asunder, transpos'd, postpon'd, anticipated, or set in any new Order, as you fansy.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is the Manner of Writing so much admir'd and imitated in our Age, that we have scarce the Idea of any other Model. We know little, indeed, of the Difference between one _Model_ or _Character_ of writing and another. All runs to the same Tune, and beats exactly one and the same Measure. Nothing, one wou'd think, cou'd be more tedious than this uniform _Pace._ The common _Amble_ or _Canterbury_ is not, I am persuaded, more tiresom to a good Rider, than this _see-saw_ of ^Essay^ -_Writers_ is to an able Reader. The just Composer of a legitimate Piece is like an able Traveller, who exactly measures his Journey, considers his Ground, premeditates his Stages, and Intervals of Relaxation and Intention, to the very Conclusion of his Undertaking, that he happily arrives where he first propos'd when he set out. He is not presently _upon the Spur,_ or in his full _Career;_ but walks his Steed _leisurely_ out of his Stable, settles himself in his Stirrups, and when fair Road and Season offer, puts on perhaps to _a round Trot;_ thence into _a Gallop,_ and after a while _takes up._ As Down, or Meadow, or shady Lane present themselves, he accordingly sutes his Pace, favours his Palfry; and is sure not to bring him puffing, and in a heat, into his last Inn. But the _Post_-way is become highly fashionable with modern Authors. The very same stroke sets you out, and brings you in. Nothing stays, or interrupts. Hill or Valley; rough or smooth; thick or thin: No Difference; no Variation. When _an Author_ sits down to write, he knows no other Business he has, than to be _witty,_ and take care that his Periods be well turn'd, or (as they commonly say) _run smooth._ In this manner, he doubts not to gain the Character of _bright._ When he has writ as many Pages as he likes, or as his Run of Fancy wou'd permit; he then perhaps considers what _Name_ he had best give to his new Writing: whether he shou'd call it _Letter, Essay, Miscellany,_ or aught else. The Bookseller perhaps is to determine this at last, when all, besides the Preface, Epistle Dedicatory, and Title-page, is dispatch'd.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"—_Incertus scamnum, faceretne Priapum._ //——_Deus inde ego!_","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"[Hesitating whether he should make a bench or a Priapus. . . .

We acknowledg his noble Sentiments and worthy Actions. We own _the Patriot,_ and _good Minister:_ But we reject _the Writer._ He was the first of any Note or Worth who gave credit to that _false_ Style and Manner here spoken of. He might, on this account, be call'd in reality _The Corrupter of_ ^Roman^ _Eloquence._ This indeed cou'd not but naturally, and of it-self, become relax and dissolute, after such a Relaxation and Dissolution of Manners, consequent to the Change of Government, and to the horrid Luxury and Effeminacy of the _Roman_ Court, even before the time of a ^Claudius,^ or a ^Nero.^ There was no more possibility of making a Stand for Language, than for Liberty. As the World now stood, the highest Glory which cou'd be attain'd by mortal Man, was to be Mitigator or Moderator of that universal Tyranny already establish'd. To this I must add, That in every City, Principality, or smaller Nation, where _single_ WILL prevails, and Court-power, instead of Laws or Constitutions, guides the State; 'tis of the highest difficulty for the best Minister to procure a just, or even a tolerable Administration. Where such a Minister is found, who can but moderately influence the petty Tyranny, he deserves considerable Applause and Honour. But in the Case we have mention'd, where a universal Monarchy was actually establish'd, and the Interest of a whole World concern'd; _He_ surely must have been esteem'd a Guardian-Angel, who, as _a prime Minister,_ cou'd, for several Years, turn the very worst of Courts, and worst-condition'd of all Princes, to the fatherly Care and just Government of Mankind. Such a _Minister_ was ^Seneca^ under an ^Agrippina^ and a ^Nero.^ And such he was acknowledg'd by the antient and never-sparing _Satirists,_ who cou'd not forbear to celebrate, withal, his _Generosity_ and _Friendship_ in a private Life: \"\"$Nemo petit, modicis quae mittebantur amicis // A ^Seneca;^ quae ^Piso^ bonus, quae ^Cotta^ solebat // Largiri: namque & titulis, & fascibus olim // Major habebatur donandi gloria.$ // [Juvenal. Sat. v. ver. 108.]\"\" \"\"$——Quis tam //Perditus, ut dubitet ^Senecam^ praeferre ^Neroni?^$// [Id. Sat. viii. ver. 211.]\"\" This Remark is what I have been tempted to make by the way, on the _Character_ of this _Roman_ Author, more mistaken (if I am not very much so my-self) than any other so generally study'd. As for the _philosophick_ Character or Function imputed to him, 'twas foreign, and no-way proper or peculiar to one who never assum'd so much as that of _Sophist,_ or _Pensionary Teacher of Philosophy._ He was far wide of any such Order, or Profession. There is great difference between a Courtier who takes a Fancy for Philosophy, and a Philosopher who shou'd take a Fancy for a Court. Now ^Seneca^ was born _a Courtier;_ being Son of a Court-_Rhetor:_ himself bred in the same manner, and taken into favour for his Wit and Genius, his admir'd Style and Eloquence; not for his Learning in the Books of Philosophy and the Antients. For this indeed was not very profound in him. In short, he was a Man of wonderful Wit, Fluency of Thought and Language, an _able Minister,_ and _honest Courtier._ And what has been deliver'd down to his prejudice, is by the common Enemy of all the free and generous ^Romans,^ that apish shallow Historian, and Court-Flatterer, ^Dion Cassius,^ of a low Age, when _Barbarism_ (as may be easily seen in his own Work) came on apace, and the very Traces and Features of Virtue, Science and Knowledg, were wearing out of the World.","subId":"n7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.3.n7"},{"type":"note","content":"_Infra,_ p. 259, 260 in the Notes.
