It was so successful that a second (corrected) edition was printed that same year. Our copytext is the third edition of 1740, the last edition to be published in Butler’s lifetime. The text here derives from the transcription of Howard Malcolm’s 1869 edition, available from Project Gutenberg. Malcolm’s edition makes substantial changes to the text, updating it to 19th century style and conventions, but this is the only transcribed version of the text currently available. We are modifying the text to bring it back in line with the original 1740 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/53346/53346-0.txt","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£5 THE £5 £1 ANALOGY £1 £5 OF £5 £2 RELIGION, £2 £4 NATURAL and REVEALED, £4 £5 TO THE £5 £3 Constitution and Course of ^Nature^. £3 £6 To whice are added £6 £5 Two brief DISSERTATIONS: £5 £5 I.
