Shortly after, Collins published a [Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell], as a direct response to Clarke's criticisms. A series of public letters between Clarke and Collins followed over the next few years, furthering the debate. They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","blocks":[{"type":"paragraph","content":"£1 A Reply to Mr. _Clark_'s Defence £1 £2 Of his LETTER to Mr. _DODWELL_. £2"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"ClarkeS","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":1705,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"ClarkeS.DBG","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1705],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Demonstration of the Being of God"},{"id":"ClarkeS.DNR","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"A Discourse on the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1706],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Discourse on Natural Religion"},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Collins.LD","breadcrumb":"Letters to Dodwell"},{"id":"ClarkeS.SDT","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1712],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity"},{"id":"ClarkeS.LCJ","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Three Letters to Dr Clarke, from a Clergyman of the Church of England; Concerning his Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity, with the Doctor's Replies","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1714],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Jackson.LCJ","breadcrumb":"Letters between Clarke and Jackson"},{"id":"ClarkeS.LCB","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Several Letters to the Reverend Dr. Clarke, from a Gentleman in Gloucestershire; with the Dr's Answers Thereunto","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1716],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Butler.LCB","breadcrumb":"Letters Between Clarke and Butler"},{"id":"ClarkeS.RPE","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Remarks upon a Book Entituled, A Philosphical Enquiry concerning Human Liberty","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1717],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Remarks upon a Philosphical Enquiry"},{"id":"ClarkeS.SS","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Seventeen Sermons on Several Occasions","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1724],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Seventeen Sermons"}]},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1675,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Collins.LD","breadcrumb":"Letters to Dodwell"}],"prev":{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.3","duplicate":"Collins.LD","title":"A Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's First Defence","published":[1707]},"next":{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.5","duplicate":"Collins.LD","title":"A Second Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Second Defence","published":[1707]}}
