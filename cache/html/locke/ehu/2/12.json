But as these simple <em>Ideas</em> are observed to exist in several Combinations united together; so the Mind has a power to consider several of them united together, as one <em>Idea</em>; and that not only as they are united in external Objects, but as it self has joined them. <em>Ideas</em> thus made up of several simple ones put together, I call <em>Complex</em>; such as are <em>Beauty, Gratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe</em>; which though complicated of various simple <em>Ideas,</em> or <em>complex Ideas,</em> made up of simple ones, yet are, when the Mind pleases, considered each by it self, as one entire thing, and signified by one name.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In this faculty of repeating and joining together its <em>Ideas,</em> the Mind has great power in varying and multiplying the Objects of its Thoughts, infinitely beyond what <em>Sensation</em> or <em>Reflection</em> furnished it with: But all this still confined to those simple <em>Ideas,</em> which it received from those two Sources, and which are the ultimate Materials of all its Compositions. For these, they are all from things themselves; and <em>the Mind can</em> have no more, nor other simple <em>Ideas,</em> than as they are suggested to it. It can have no other <em>Ideas</em> of sensible Qualities, than what come from without by the Senses; nor any <em>Ideas</em> of other kind of Operations of a thinking Substance, than what it finds in it self: but when it has once got those simple <em>Ideas,</em> it is not confined barely to Observation, and what offers it self from without, it can, by its own power, put together those <em>Ideas</em> it has, and <em>make new complex ones,</em> which it never received so united.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Complex Ideas,</em> however compounded and decompounded, though their number be infinite, and the variety endless, wherewith they fill, and and entertain the Thoughts of Men; yet, I think, they may be all reduced under these three Heads: <br><em>Modes.</em> <br><em>Substances.</em> <br><em>Relations.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"First, <em>Modes</em> I call such complex <em>Ideas,</em> which however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as Dependences on, or Affections of Substances; such are the <em>Ideas</em> signified by the words <em>Triangle, Gratitude, Murther, &amp;c.</em> and if in this I use the word <em>Mode,</em> in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in Discourses, differing from the ordinary received Notions, either to make new Words, or to use old Words in somewhat a new signification; which in our present case, is perhaps the more tolerable of the two.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of these <em>Modes,</em> there are two sorts, which deserve distinct consideration. First, There are some which are only variations, or different combinations of the same simple <em>Idea,</em> without the mixture of any other, as a dozen, or score; which are nothing but the <em>Ideas</em> of so many distinct Unites added together, and these I call <em>simple Modes,</em> as being contained within the bounds of one simple <em>Idea.</em> Secondly, There are others compounded of simple <em>Ideas</em> of several kinds, put together to make one complex one; <em>v. g. Beauty,</em> consisting of a certain composition of Colour and Figure, causing delight in the Beholder; <em>Theft,</em> which being the concealed change of the possession of any thing, without the consent of the Proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several <em>Ideas</em> of several kinds; and these I call <em>mixed Modes.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Secondly, The <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Substances</em> are such combinations of simple <em>Ideas,</em> as are taken to represent distinct particular things subsisting by themselves; in which the supposed, or confused <em>Idea</em> of Substance, such as it is, is always the first and chief. Thus if to Substance be joined the simple <em>Idea</em> of a certain dull whitish colour, with certain degrees of Weight, Hardness, Ductility, and Fusibility, we have the <em>Idea</em> of <em>Lead</em>; and a combination of the <em>Ideas</em> of a certain sort of Figure, with the powers of Motion, Thought, and Reasoning, joined to Substance, make the ordinary <em>Idea</em> of <em>a Man.</em> Now of Substances also, there are two sorts of <em>Ideas</em>; one of single Substances, as they exist separately, as of <em>a Man, or a Sheep</em>; the other of several of those put together, as an <em>Army</em> of Men, or <em>Flock</em> of Sheep; which <em>collective Ideas of</em> several <em>Substances</em> thus put together, are as much each of them one single <em>Idea,</em> as that of a Man, or an Unite.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thirdly, The last sort of complex <em>Ideas,</em> is that we call <em>Relation,</em> which consists in the consideration and comparing one <em>Idea</em> with another, of these several kinds, we shall treat in their order.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If we will trace the progress of our Minds, and with attention observe how it repeats, adds together, and unites its simple <em>Ideas</em> received from Sensation or Reflection, it will lead us farther than at first, perhaps, we should have imagined. And, I believe, we shall find, if we warily observe the Originals of our Notions, that even <em>the most abstruse Ideas,</em> how remote soever they may seem from Sense, or any operation of our own Minds, are yet only such as the Understanding frames to it self, by repeating and joining together <em>Ideas,</em> that it had either from Objects of Sense, or its own operations about them: So that those even large <em>and abstract Ideas are derived from Sensation, or Reflection,</em> being no other than what the Mind by the ordinary use of its own Faculties, employ'd about <em>Ideas</em> received from Objects of Sense, or the Operations it observes in it self about them, may, and does attain unto.
