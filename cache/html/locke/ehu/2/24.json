The text is derived from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP.

Nor is it harder to conceive, how an Army of ten Thousand Men, should make one <em>Idea,</em> than how a Man should make one <em>Idea</em>; it being as easie to the Mind, to unite into one, the <em>Idea</em> of a great number of Men, and consider it as one; as it is to unite into one particular, all the distinct <em>Ideas,</em> that make up the composition of a Man, and consider them altogether as one","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.24.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Amongst such kind of collective <em>Ideas,</em> are to be counted most part of artificial Things, at least such of them as are made up of distinct Substances: And, in truth, if we consider all these collective <em>Ideas</em> aright, as <em>ARMY, Constellation, Universe,</em> as they are united into so many single <em>Ideas,</em> they are but the artificial Draughts of the Mind, bringing things very remote, and independent one from another, into one view, the better to contemplate, and discourse of them, united into one conception, and signified by one name.
