This kind of Honour, commonly called Gentry, has been derived from the Antient Germans. For there never was any such thing known, where the German Customes were unknown. Nor is it now any where in use, where the Germans have not inhabited. The antient Greek Commanders, when they went to war, had their Shields painted with such Devises as they pleased; insomuch as an unpainted Buckler was a signe of Poverty, and of a common Souldier: but they transmitted not the Inheritance of them. The Romans transmitted the Marks of their Families: but they were the Images, not the Devises of their Ancestors. Amongst the people of <em>Asia, Afrique</em>, and <em>America</em>, there is not, nor was ever, any such thing. The Germans onely had that custome; from whom it has been derived into <em>England, France, Spain</em> and <em>Italy</em>, when in great numbers they either ayded the Romans, or made their own Conquests in these Westerne parts of the world.","subId":"50","id":"Hobbes.L.1.10.50"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For <em>Germany</em>, being antiently, as all other Countries, in their beginnings, divided amongst an infinite number of little Lords, or Masters of Families, that continually had wars one with another; those Masters, or Lords, principally to the end they might, when they were Covered with Arms, be known by their followers; and partly for ornament, both painted their Armor, or their Scutchion, or Coat, with the picture of some Beast, or other thing; and also put some eminent and visible mark upon the Crest of their Helmets. And this ornament both of the Armes, and Crest, descended by inheritance to their Children; to the eldest pure, and to the rest with some note of diversity, such as the Old master, that is to say in Dutch, the <em>Here-alt</em> thought fit. But when many such Families, joyned together, made a greater Monarchy, this duty of the Herealt, to distinguish Scutchions, was made a private Office a part. And the issue of these Lords, is the great and antient Gentry; which for the most part bear living creatures, noted for courage, and rapine: or Castles, Battlements, Belts, Weapons, Bars, Palisadoes, and other notes of War; nothing being then in honour, but vertue military. Afterwards, not onely Kings, but popular Common-wealths, gave divers manners of Scutchions, to such as went forth to the War, or returned from it, for encouragement, or recompence to their service. All which, by an observing Reader, may be found in such antient Histories, Greek and Latine, as make mention of the German Nation, and Manners, in their times.","subId":"51","id":"Hobbes.L.1.10.51"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Titles of <em>Honour</em>, such as are Duke, Count, Marquis,<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Titles of Honour.</em></span> and Baron, are Honourable; as signifying the value set upon them by the Soveraigne Power of the Common-wealth: Which Titles, were in old time titles of Office, and Command, derived some from the Romans, some from the Germans, and French. Dukes, in Latine <em>Duces</em>, being Generalls in War: Counts, <em>Comites</em>, such as bare the Generall company out of friendship; and were left to govern and defend places conquered, and pacified: Marquises, <em>Marchiones</em>, were Counts that governed the Marches, or bounds of the Empire. Which titles of Duke, Count, and Marquis, came into the Empire, about the time of <em>Constantine</em> the Great, from the customes of the German <em>Militia</em>.

In processe of time these offices of Honour, by occasion of trouble, and for reasons of good and peaceable government, were turned into meer Titles; serving for the most part, to distinguish the precedence, place, and order of subjects in the Common-wealth: and men were made Dukes, Counts, Marquises, and Barons of Places, wherein they had neither possession, nor command: and other Titles also, were devised to the same end.","subId":"52","id":"Hobbes.L.1.10.52"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Worthinesse.
