That great captain and philosopher, the disciple of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Socrates</span>, and one who has delivered some of the most refined sentiments with regard to a deity, gave all the following marks of vulgar, pagan superstition. By <span class=\"small-capitals\">Socrates</span>'s advice, he consulted the oracle of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Delphi</span>, before he would engage in the expedition of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cyrus</span>. De exped. lib. iii. p. 294. ex edit Leuncl. Sees a dream the night after the generals were seized; which he pays great regard to, but thinks ambiguous. Id. p. 295.

Has another dream, when he comes to the river <span class=\"small-capitals\">Centrites</span>, which his fellow-general, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Chirosophus</span>, also pays great regard to. Id. lib. iv. p. 323. The <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greeks</span>, suffering from a cold north wind, sacrifice to it; and the historian observes, that it immediately abated. Id. p. 329. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Xenophon</span> consults the sacrifices in <span class=\"page-break\"></span>secret, before he would form any resolution with himself about settling a colony. Lib. v. p. 359. He was himself a very skilful augur. Id. p. 361. Is determined by the victims to refuse the sole command of the army which was offered him. Lib. vi. p. 273. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cleander</span>, the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spartan</span>, though very desirous of it, refuses it for the same reason. Id. p. 392. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Xenophon</span> mentions an old dream with the interpretation given him, when he first joined <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cyrus</span>, p. 373.

His friend, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Euclides</span>, the augur, would not believe that he had brought no money from the expedition; till he (<span class=\"small-capitals\">Euclides</span>) sacrificed, and then he saw the matter clearly in the Exta.

De rat. red. p. 392. That all this devotion was not a farce, in order to serve a political purpose, appears both from the facts themselves, and from the genius of that age, when little or nothing could be gained by hypocrisy. Besides, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Xenophon</span>, as appears from his Memorabilia, was a kind of heretic in those times, which no political devotee ever is.
