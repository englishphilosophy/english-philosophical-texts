# To do

1. TF-IDF everything in Hume's corpus (minus the History)
2. [As much as possible, sort out lemmas/citations/names in those texts...]
3. For each section of the Treatise, compare similarity of all later works to it
4. Identify closest match to every section of Book 2, and collect those together as "Book 2 revisited"
5. Compare highest ranking lemmas (by TF-IDF) in Book 2 to those in Book 2 revisited
