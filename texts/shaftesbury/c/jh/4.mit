£1 Chapter IV. Of the Third Figure £1

{#1} CONCERNING ^Pleasure^ there needs little to be said, after what has been
already remark'd in relation to the two preceding Figures. The Truth of
_Appearance,_ that of _History,_ and even the _Decorum_ it-self, (according to
what has been explain'd above) require evidently that in this Period or Instant
describ'd, ^Pleasure^ shou'd be found silent. She can have no other Language
allow'd her than that merely of _the Eyes._ And 'twou'd be a happy Management
for her in the Design, if in turning her Eyes to meet those of ^Hercules^, she
shou'd find his Head and Face already turn'd so much on the contrary side, as to
shew it impossible for her as yet to discover the growing Passion of this Hero
in favour of her Rival. By this means she might still with good right retain her
fond Airs of Dalliance and Courtship; as having yet discover'd no reason she has
to be dissatisfy'd.

{#2} (2.) She may be drawn either _standing, leaning, sitting,_ or _lying;_
without a Crown, or crown'd either with Roses, or with Myrtle; according to the
Painter's Fancy. And since in this _third_ Figure the Painter has so great a
liberty left him, he may make good advantage of it for the other _two,_ to which
_this latter_ may be subjected, as the last in order, and of least consequence.

{#3} (3.) That which makes the greatest difficulty in the Disposition or
Ordonnance of this Figure ^Pleasure^, is, that notwithstanding the supine Air
and Character of Ease and Indolence, which shou'd be given her, she must retain
still so much Life and Action, as is sufficient to express her _persuasive
Effort,_ and Manner of _Indication_ towards her proper Paths; those of the
flowery kind, and Vale below, whither she wou'd willingly guide our Hero's
steps. Now shou'd this _Effort_ be over-strongly express'd; not only the supine
Character and Air of Indolence wou'd be lost in this Figure of ^Pleasure^; but,
what is worse, the Figure wou'd seem to speak, or at least appear so, as to
create a double Meaning, or _equivocal Sense_ in Painting: which wou'd destroy
what we have establish'd as fundamental, concerning the absolute Reign of
_Silence_ thro'out the rest of the Piece, in favour of ^Virtue^, the sole
speaking Party at this Instant, or third Period of our History.

{#4} (4.) According to a Computation, which in this way of Reasoning might be
made, of the whole _Motion_ or _Action_ to be given to our Figure of ^Pleasure^;
she shou'd scarce have _one fifth_ reserv'd for that which we may properly call
_active_ in her, and have already term'd her _persuasive_ or _indicative
Effort._ All besides shou'd be employ'd to express, if one may say so, her
_Inaction,_ her _Supineness, Effeminacy,_ and _indulgent Ease._ The Head and
Body might intirely favour this latter Passion. One Hand might be absolutely
resign'd to it; serving only to support, with much ado, the lolling lazy Body.
And if the other Hand be requir'd to express some kind of Gesture or Action
toward the Road of Pleasures recommended by this Dame; the Gesture ought however
to be slight and negligent, in the manner of one who has given over speaking,
and appears weary and spent.

{#5} (5.) For the _Shape,_ the _Person,_ the _Complexion,_ and what else may be
further remark'd as to the _Air_ and _Manner_ of ^Pleasure^; all this is
naturally comprehended in the Opposition, as above stated, between _Her-self_
and ^Virtue^.
