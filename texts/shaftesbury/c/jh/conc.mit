£1 Conclusion £1

{#1} WE may conclude this Argument with a general Reflection, which seems to
arise naturally from what has been said on this Subject in particular: "That in
a real _History-Painter,_ the same Knowledg, the same Study, and Views, are
requir'd, as in a real _Poet._" Never can the _Poet,_ whilst he justly holds
that name, become a _Relator,_ or _Historian_ at large. He is allow'd only to
describe a single Action; not the Actions of a single Man, or People. The
_Painter_ is a Historian at the same rate, but still more narrowly confin'd, as
in fact appears; since it wou'd certainly prove a more ridiculous Attempt to
comprehend two or three distinct Actions or Parts of History in _one_ Picture,
than to comprehend ten times the number in _one_ and _the same_ Poem.

{#2} (2.) Tis well known, that to each Species of Poetry, there are natural
Proportions and Limits assign'd. And it wou'd be a gross Absurdity indeed to
imagine, that in a Poem there was nothing which we cou'd call _Measure_ or
_Number,_ except merely in the Verse. An Elegy, and an Epigram, have each of 'em
their Measure, and Proportion, as well as a Tragedy, or Epick Poem. In the same
manner, as to Painting, Sculpture, or Statuary, there are particular Measures
which form what we call _a Piece:_ as for instance, in mere Portraiture, _a
Head,_ or _Bust:_ the former of which must retain always the whole, or at least
a certain part of the Neck; as the latter the Shoulders, and a certain part of
the Breast. If any thing be added or retrench'd, the _Piece_ is destroy'd. 'Tis
then a mangled Trunk, or dismember'd Body, which presents it-self to our
Imagination; and this too not thro' use merely, or on the account of custom, but
of necessity, and by the nature of the Appearance: since there are such and such
parts of the human Body, which are naturally match'd, and must appear in
company: the Section, if unskilfully made, being in reality horrid, and
representing rather an _Amputation_ in Surgery, than a seemly _Division_ or
_Separation_ according to _Art._ And thus it is, that in general, thro' all the
plastick Arts, or Works of Imitation, "Whatsoever is drawn from Nature, with the
intention of raising in us the Imagination of the natural Species or Object,
according to real _Beauty_ and _Truth,_ shou'd be compriz'd in certain compleat
Portions or Districts, which represent the Correspondency or Union of each
_part_ of Nature, with _intire_ ^Nature^ _her-self._" And 'tis this natural
Apprehension, or anticipating Sense of _Unity,_ which makes us give even to the
Works of our inferior Artizans, the name of _Pieces_ by way of Excellence, and
as denoting the _Justness_ and _Truth_ of Work.

{#3} (3.) In order therefore to succeed rightly in the Formation of any thing
truly beautiful in this higher Order of Design; 'twere to be wish'd that the
Artist, who had Understanding enough to comprehend what _a real Piece_ or
_Tablature_ imported, and who, in order to this, had acquir'd the Knowledg of _a
Whole_ and _Parts,_ wou'd afterwards apply himself to the Study of _moral_ and
_poetick Truth:_ that by this means the Thoughts, Sentiments, or _Manners,_
which hold the first rank in his historical Work, might appear sutable to the
higher and nobler Species of Humanity in which he practis'd, to the Genius of
the Age which he describ'd, and to the principal or main Action which he chose
to represent. He wou'd then naturally learn to reject those false Ornaments of
_affected Graces, exaggerated Passions, hyperbolical_ and _prodigious Forms;_
which, equally with the mere _capricious_ and _grotesque,_ destroy the just
_Simplicity,_ and _Unity,_ essential in a ^Piece^. And for his _Colouring;_ he
wou'd then soon find how much it became him to be reserv'd, severe, and chaste,
in this particular of his Art; where Luxury and Libertinism are, by the power of
Fashion and the modern Taste, become so universally establish'd.

{#4} (4.) 'Tis evident however from Reason it-self, as well as from[n1] History
and Experience, that nothing is more fatal, either to Painting, Architecture, or
the other Arts, than this _false Relish,_ which is govern'd rather by what
immediately strikes the Sense, than by what consequentially and by reflection
pleases the Mind, and satisfies the Thought and Reason. So that whilst we look
on _Painting_ with the same Eye, as we view commonly the rich Stuffs, and
colour'd Silks worn by our Ladys, and admir'd in Dress, Equipage, or Furniture;
we must of necessity be effeminate in our Taste, and utterly set wrong as to all
Judgment and Knowledg in the kind. For of this _imitative Art_ we may justly
say; "That tho It borrows help indeed from Colours, and uses them, as means, to
execute its Designs; It has nothing, however, more wide of its real Aim, or more
remote from its Intention, than to make _a shew_ of Colours, or from their
mixture, to raise a[n2] _separate_ and _flattering_ Pleasure to the ^Sense^."

{#n1} _See_ ^Vitruvius^, _and_ ^Pliny^.

{#n2} _The Pleasure is plainly foreign and_ separate, _as having no concern or
share in the proper Delight or Entertainment which naturally arises from the
Subject, and Workmanship it-self. For the Subject, in respect of Pleasure, as
well as Science, is absolutely compleated, when the Design is executed, and the
propos'd Imitation once accomplish'd. And thus it always is the best, when the
Colours are most subdu'd, and made subservient._
