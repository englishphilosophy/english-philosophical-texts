£1 Chapter III. Of the Second Figure £1

{#1} AFTER what has been said on the Subject of ^Hercules^, it appears plainly
what the _Attitude_ must be of our second Figure, ^Virtue^; who, as we have
taken her in this particular Period of our History, must of necessity be
_speaking_ with all the Force of Action, such as wou'd appear in an excellent
Orator, when at the height, and in the most affecting part of his Discourse.

{#2} (2.) She ought therefore to be drawn _standing;_ since 'tis contrary to all
probable Appearance, and even to Nature it-self, that in the very Heat and
highest Transport of Speech, the Speaker shou'd be seen sitting, or in any
Posture which might express Repose.

{#3} (3.) She may be _habited_ either as an ^Amazon^, with the Helmet, Lance,
and in the Robe or Vest of ^Pallas^; or as any other of the _Virtues,
Goddesses,_ or _Heroines,_ with the plain original Crown, without Rays,
according to genuine Antiquity. Our History makes no mention of a Helmet, or any
other Armour of ^Virtue^. It gives us only to understand, that she was dress'd
neither negligently, nor with much study or ornament. If we follow this latter
method, we need give her only in her hand the Imperial or[n1] Magisterial Sword;
which is her true characteristick Mark, and wou'd sufficiently distinguish her,
without the Helmet, Lance, or other military Habit. And in this manner, the
opposition between her-self and her Rival wou'd be still more beautiful and
regular.—"But this Beauty, says one, wou'd be discoverable only by the
Learned."—Perhaps so. But then again, there wou'd be no loss for others: since
no-one wou'd find this Piece the less intelligible on the account of this
Regulation. On the contrary, one who chanc'd to know little of Antiquity in
general, or of this History in particular, wou'd be still further to seek, if
upon seeing an armed Woman in the Piece, he shou'd represent to himself either a
^Pallas^, a ^Bellona^, or any other warlike Form, or Deity of the female kind.

{#4} (4.) As for the _Shape, Countenance,_ or Person of ^Virtue^; that which is
usually given to ^Pallas^ may fitly serve as a Model for this Dame; as on the
other side, that which is given to ^Venus^ may serve in the same manner for her
Rival. The Historian whom we follow, represents ^Virtue^ to us as a Lady of a
goodly Form, tall and majestick. And by what he relates of her, he gives us
sufficiently to understand, that tho she was neither lean, nor of a tann'd
Complexion, she must have discover'd however, by the Substance and Colour of her
Flesh, that she was sufficiently accustom'd to exercise. ^Pleasure^, on the
other hand, by an exact Opposition, is represented in better case, and of a
Softness of Complexion; which speaks her Manners, and gives her a middle
Character between the Person of a ^Venus^, and that of a ^Bacchinal^ _Nymph._

{#5} (5.) As for the _Position,_ or _Attitude_ of ^Virtue^; tho in a historical
Piece, such as ours is design'd, 'twou'd on no account be proper to have
immediate recourse to the way of _Emblem;_ one might, on this occasion,
endeavour nevertheless by some artifice to give our Figure, as much as possible,
the resemblance of the same _Goddess,_ as she is seen on Medals, and other
antient _emblematick_ Pieces of like nature. In this view, she shou'd be so
design'd, as to stand firm with her full poise upon one foot, having the other a
little advanc'd, and rais'd on a broken piece of ground or rock, instead of the
Helmet or little Globe on which we see her usually setting her foot, as
triumphant, in those Pieces of the _emblematick_ kind. A particular advantage of
this Attitude, so judiciously assign'd to ^Virtue^ by antient Masters, is, that
it expresses as well her aspiring Effort, or Ascent towards the Stars and
Heaven, as her Victory and Superiority over Fortune and the World. For so the
Poets have, of old, describ'd her.

{#6} [n2]Attempts a course by a path denied. //[n3]And deserts the path of
difficult virtue.

{#7} And in our Piece particularly, where the _arduous_ and _rocky way_ of
^Virtue^ requires to be emphatically represented; the ascending Posture of this
Figure, with one Foot advanc'd, in a sort of climbing Action, over the rough and
thorny Ground, must of necessity, if well executed, create a due effect, and add
to the Sublime of this[n4] antient _Poetick_ Work.

{#8} (6.) As for the _Hands_ or _Arms,_ which in real Oratory, and during the
strength of Elocution, must of necessity be active; 'tis plain in respect of our
Goddess, that the Arm in particular which she has free to her-self, and is
neither incumber'd with Lance or Sword, shou'd be employ'd another way, and come
in, to second the Discourse, and accompany it, with a just Emphasis and Action.
Accordingly, ^Virtue^ wou'd then be seen with this Hand, turn'd either _upwards_
to the rocky Way mark'd out by her with approbation; or to the Sky, or Stars, in
the same sublime sense; or _downwards_ to the flowery Way and Vale, as in a
detesting manner, and with abhorrence of what passes there; or last of all (in a
disdainful sense, and with the same appearance of Detestation) against
^Pleasure^ herself. Each Manner wou'd have its peculiar advantage. And the best
Profit shou'd be made of this Arm and Hand at liberty, to express either the
_Disapprobation_ or the _Applause_ propos'd. It might prove, however, a
considerable advantage to our Figure of ^Virtue^, if holding the Lance, or
Imperial Sword, slightly, with one of her Hands stretch'd downwards, she cou'd,
by that very Hand and Action, be made to express _the latter_ meaning; opening
for that purpose some of the lower Fingers of this Hand, in a refusing or
repelling manner; whilst with the other Arm and Hand at liberty, she shou'd
express as well _the former_ meaning, and point out to ^Hercules^ the way which
leads to Honour, and the just Glory of heroick Actions.

{#9} (7.) From all these Circumstances of History, and Action, accompanying this
important Figure, the difficulty of the Design will sufficiently appear, to
those who carry their Judgment beyond the _mere Form,_ and are able to consider
the Character of the Passion to which it is subjected. For where a real
Character is mark'd, and _the inward Form_ peculiarly describ'd, 'tis necessary
_the outward_ shou'd give place. Whoever shou'd expect to see our Figure of
^Virtue^, in the exact Mein of a _fine Talker,_ curious in her Choice of Action,
and forming it according to the usual Decorum, and regular Movement of one of
the fair Ladys of our Age, wou'd certainly be far wide of the Thought and Genius
of this Piece. Such study'd Action, and artificial Gesture, may be allow'd to
the Actors and Actrices of the Stage. But the good Painter must come a little
nearer to ^Truth^, and take care that his Action be not _theatrical,_ or at
second hand; but _original,_ and drawn from ^Nature^ her-self. Now altho in the
ordinary Tenour of Discourse, the Action of the Party might be allow'd to appear
so far govern'd and compos'd by Art, as to retain that regular _Contraste,_ and
nice Balance of Movement, which Painters are apt to admire as the chief Grace of
Figures; yet in this particular case, where the natural Eagerness of Debate,
supported by a thorow Antipathy and Animosity, is join'd to a sort of
_enthusiastick Agitation_ incident to our prophetick Dame, there can be little
of that fashionable Mein, or genteel Air admitted. The Painter who, in such a
Piece as we describe, is bound to preserve the heroick Style, will doubtless
beware of representing his Heroine as a mere _Scold._ Yet this is certain, That
it were better for him to expose himself to the Meanness of such a Fancy, and
paint his Lady in a high Rant, according to the common Weakness of the Sex, than
to engage in the Embelishment of the mere _Form;_ and, forgetting the Character
of Severity and Reprimand belonging to the illustrious Rival, present her to us
a fair specious Personage, free of Emotion, and without the least Bent or
Movement, which shou'd express the real _Pathetick_ of the kind.
