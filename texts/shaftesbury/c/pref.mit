{#1} _IF the Author of these united Tracts had been any Friend to ^Prefaces^, he
wou'd probably have made his Entrance after that manner, in one or other of the
Five Treatises formerly publish'd apart. But as to all _Prefatory_ or
_Dedicatory_ Discourse, he has told us his Mind sufficiently, in that Treatise
which he calls ^Soliloquy^. Being satisfy'd however, that there are many Persons
who esteem these _Introductory Pieces_ as very essential in the Constitution of
a Work; he has thought fit, in behalf of his honest _Printer_, to substitute
these Lines under the Title of ^a Preface^; and to declare, "That (according to
his best Judgment and Authority) these Presents ought to pass, and be receiv'd,
constru'd, and taken, as satisfactory in full, for all Preliminary Composition,
Dedication, direct or indirect Application for Favour to the Publick, or to any
private Patron, or Party whatsoever: Nothing to the contrary appearing to him,
from the side of _Truth_, or _Reason_. Witness his Hand, this Fifth Day of
_December_, _1710_."_
