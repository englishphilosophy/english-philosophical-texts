{#1} THE only thing, my Lord, I wou'd infer from all this, is, that ^Enthusiasm^
is wonderfully powerful and extensive; that it is a matter of nice Judgment, and
the hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly; since even[n1]
_Atheism_ is not exempt from it. For, as some have well remark'd, there have
been _Enthusiastical Atheists_. Nor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward
Marks, be easily distinguish'd from it. For Inspiration is _a real_ feeling of
the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm _a false one_. But the Passion they raise is
much alike. For when the Mind is taken up in Vision, and fixes its view either
on any real Object, or mere Specter of Divinity; when it sees, or thinks it sees
any thing prodigious, and more than human; its Horror, Delight, Confusion, Fear,
Admiration, or whatever Passion belongs to it, or is uppermost on this occasion,
will have something vast, _immane_, and (as Painters say) _beyond Life_. And
this is what gave occasion to the name of _Fanaticism_, as it was us'd by the
Antients in its original Sense, for an _Apparition_ transporting the Mind.

{#2} Something there will be of Extravagance and Fury, when the Ideas or Images
receiv'd are too big for the narrow human Vessel to contain. So that
_Inspiration_ may be justly call'd _Divine_ ^Enthusiasm^: For the Word it-self
signifies _Divine Presence_, and was made use of by the Philosopher whom the
earliest Christian Fathers call'd _Divine_, to express whatever was sublime in
human Passions[n2]. This was the Spirit he allotted to _Heroes, Statesmen,
Poets, Orators, Musicians_, and even _Philosophers_ themselves. Nor can we, of
our own accord, forbear ascribing to a[n3] noble ^Enthusiasm^, whatever is
greatly perform'd by any of _These_. So that almost all of us know something of
this Principle. But to know it as we shou'd do, and discern it in its several
kinds, both in our-selves, and others; this is the great Work, and by this means
alone we can hope to avoid Delusion. For _to judg the Spirits whether they are
of God_, we must antecedently _judg our own Spirit_; whether it be of _Reason_
and _sound Sense_; whether it be fit to _judg_ at all, by being sedate, cool,
and impartial; free of every biassing Passion, every giddy Vapor, or melancholy
Fume. This is the first Knowledg and previous Judgment: "To understand
_our-selves_, and know _what Spirit we are of_." Afterwards we may judg the
_Spirit_ in others, consider what their personal Merit is, and prove the
Validity of their Testimony by the Solidity of their Brain. By this means we may
prepare our-selves with some _Antidote_ against Enthusiasm. And this is what I
have dar'd affirm is best perform'd by keeping to ^Good Humour^. For otherwise
the Remedy it-self may turn to the Disease.

{#3} And now, my Lord, having, after all, in some measure justify'd
^Enthusiasm^, and own'd the Word; if I appear extravagant, in addressing to you
after the manner I have done, you must allow me to plead an _Impulse_. You must
suppose me (as with truth you may) most passionately yours; and with that
Kindness which is natural to you on other occasions, you must tolerate your
_Enthusiastick Friend_, who, excepting only in the case of this over-forward
_Zeal_, must ever appear with the highest Respect, __^My Lord^, _____Your
Lordship's_, &c.

{#n2} $Ἄρ' οἰ̑σθ' ὅτι ὑπὸ τω̑ν Νυμφω̑ν ἐκ προνοίας σαφω̑ς ἐνθουσιάσω . . .
τοσαυ̑τα μέν σοι καὶ ἔτι πλείω ἔχω μανίας γιγνμένης ἀπὸ θεω̑ν λέγειν καλὰ ἔργα,
&c.$ [Phaedr.] $καὶ τοὺς πολιτικοὺς οὐχ ἥκιστα τούτων φαι̑μεν ἂν θείους τε
εἰ̑ναι καὶ ἐνθουσιάζειν.$ [Meno.] $ἔγνων οὐ̑ν ἂν καὶ περὶ τω̑ν ποιητω̑ν ἐν ὀλίγῳ
του̑το, ὅτι οὐ σοφίᾳ ποιοι̑εν, ἀλλὰ φύσει τινὶ καὶ ἐνθουσιάζοντες, ὥσπερ οἱ
θεομάντεις καὶ χρησμῳδοί.$ [Apol.] In particular as to _Philosophers_,
^=Plutarch=^ tells us, 'twas the Complaint of some of the four old _Romans_,
when Learning first came to them from _Greece_, that their Youth grew
_Enthusiastick_ with Philosophy. For speaking of one of the Philosophers of the
_Athenian_ Embassy, he says, $ἔρωτα δεινὸν ἐμβέβληκε τοι̑ς νέοις ὑφ' οὑ̑ τω̑ν
ἄλλων ἡδονω̑ν καὶ διατριβω̑ν ἐκπεσόντες ἐνθουσιω̑σι τερὶ φιλοσοφίαν.$ [Plut.
_Cato Major_.] =Plato=, [_Phaedrus_, 241 ^e^], seems here misquoted. The
accepted text means: I suppose you know that I shall be quite possessed
($ἐνθουσιάσω$) by the nymphs, to whom you have designedly exposed me. [Plato,
_Menon_, 99 ^d^]: And, among them, we should say that the politicians were
specially rapt and inspired ($ἐνθουσιάζειν$). [Plato, _Apol_. 22 ^b^] (slightly
misquoted). The right version would give: So I observed also about poets in a
short time that they did not compose out of wisdom, but from an instinct and an
inspiration ($ἐνθουσιάζοντες$) like seers and prophets. [Plutarch, _Cato Major_,
22]: He put a spell upon young men, under which they give up other pleasures and
amusements, and are possessed by philosophy ($ἐνθουσιω̑σι$).
