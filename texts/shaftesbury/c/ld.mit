£1 A Letter Concerning the Art, or Science of Design £1

{#1} _The Muses before all things._[n1]

{#2} THIS Letter comes to your Lordship, accompany'd with a small Writing
intitled ^A Notion^: for such alone can that Piece deservedly be call'd, which
aspires no higher than to the forming of a _Project,_ and that too in so vulgar
a Science as _Painting._ But whatever the Subject be, if it can prove any way
entertaining to you, it will sufficiently answer my Design. And if possibly it
may have that good success, I shou'd have no ordinary opinion of my Project;
since I know how hard it wou'd be to give your Lordship a real Entertainment by
any thing which was not in some respect worthy and useful.

{#3} On this account I must, by way of prevention, inform your Lordship, that
after I had conceiv'd my ^Notion^ such as you see it upon paper, I was not
contented with this, but fell directly to work; and by the Hand of a
Master-Painter brought it into _Practice,_ and form'd a real _Design._ This was
not enough. I resolv'd afterwards to see what effect it wou'd have, when taken
out of mere Black-and-White, into Colours: And thus _a Sketch_ was afterwards
drawn. This pleas'd so well, that being incourag'd by the _Virtuosi,_ who are so
eminent in this part of the World, I resolv'd at last to engage my Painter in
the great Work. Immediately a Cloth was bespoke of a sutable Dimension, and the
Figures taken as big or bigger than the common Life; the Subject being of the
Heroick kind, and requiring rather such Figures as shou'd appear above ordinary
human Stature.

{#4} Thus my ^Notion^, as light as it may prove in the _Treatise,_ is become
very substantial in the _Workmanship._ The Piece is still in hand; and like to
continue so for some time. Otherwise the first Draught or Design shou'd have
accompany'd the Treatise; as the Treatise does this Letter. But the _Design_
having grown thus into _a Sketch,_ and the Sketch afterwards into _a Picture;_ I
thought it fit your Lordship shou'd either see the several Pieces together, or
be troubled only with that which was the best; as undoubtedly the great one must
prove, if the Master I employ sinks not very much below himself, in this
Performance.

{#5} Far surely shou'd I be, my Lord, from conceiving any Vanity or Pride in
Amusements of such an inferior kind as these; especially were they such as they
may naturally at first sight appear. I pretend not here to apologize either for
_them,_ or for _my-self._ Your Lordship however knows, I have naturally Ambition
enough to make me desirous of employing my-self in Business of a higher Order:
since it has been my fortune in publick Affairs to act often in concert with
you, and in the same Views, on the Interest of ^Europe^ and Mankind. There was a
Time, and that a very early one of my Life, when I was not wanting to my
Country, in this respect. But after some years of hearty Labour and Pains in
this kind of Workmanship, an unhappy Breach in my Health drove me not only from
the Seat of Business, but forc'd me to seek these foreign Climates; where, as
mild as the _Winters_ generally are, I have with much ado liv'd out this
_latter-one;_ and am now, as your Lordship finds, employing my-self in such easy
Studys as are most sutable to my state of Health, and to the Genius of the
Country where I am confin'd.

{#6} This in the mean time I can, with some assurance, say to your Lordship in a
kind of spirit of Prophecy, from what I have observ'd of the rising Genius of
our Nation, That if we live to see a Peace any way answerable to that generous
Spirit with which this War was begun, and carry'd on, for our _own_ Liberty and
that of ^Europe^; the Figure we are like to make abroad, and the Increase of
Knowledg, Industry and Sense at home, will render _united_ ^Britain^ the
principal Seat of Arts; and by her Politeness and Advantages in this kind, will
shew evidently, how much she owes to those Counsels, which taught her to exert
herself so resolutely in behalf of the _common Cause,_ and that of her own
_Liberty,_ and happy _Constitution,_ necessarily included.

{#7} I can my-self remember the Time, when, in respect of ^Musick^, our reigning
Taste was in many degrees inferior to the _French._ The long Reign of Luxury and
Pleasure under King ^Charles^ the Second, and the foreign Helps and study'd
Advantages given to _Musick_ in a following Reign, cou'd not raise our Genius
the least in this respect. But when the Spirit of the Nation was grown more
_free,_ tho engag'd at that time in the fiercest War, and with the most doubtful
Success, we no sooner began to turn our-selves towards _Musick,_ and enquire
what ^Italy^ in particular produc'd, than in an instant we outstrip'd our
Neighbours the ^French^, enter'd into a Genius far beyond theirs, and rais'd
our-selves an _Ear,_ and _Judgment,_ not inferior to the best now in the World.

{#8} In the same manner, as to ^Painting^. Tho we have as yet nothing of our own
native Growth in this kind worthy of being mention'd; yet since the Publick has
of late begun to express a Relish for Ingravings, Drawings, Copyings, and for
the original Paintings of the chief _Italian_ Schools, (so contrary to the
modern _French_) I doubt not that, in very few years, we shall make an equal
progress in this other Science. And when our Humour turns us to cultivate these
designing Arts, our Genius, I am persuaded, will naturally carry us over the
slighter Amusements, and lead us to that higher, more serious, and noble Part of
_Imitation,_ which relates to _History, Human Nature,_ and _the chief Degree or
Order of_ ^Beauty^; I mean that of the _rational_ Life, distinct from the merely
_vegetable_ and _sensible,_ as in Animals, or Plants; according to those several
Degrees or Orders of Painting, which your Lordship will find suggested in this
extemporary _Notion_ I have sent you.

{#9} As for ^Architecture^, 'tis no wonder if so many noble Designs of this kind
have miscarry'd amongst us; since the Genius of our Nation has hitherto been so
little turn'd this way, that thro' several Reigns we have patiently seen the
noblest publick Buildings perish (if I may say so) under the Hand of one single
Court-Architect; who, if he had been able to profit by Experience, wou'd long
since, at our expence, have prov'd the greatest Master in the World. But I
question whether our Patience is like to hold much longer. The Devastation so
long committed in this kind, has made us begin to grow rude and clamorous at the
hearing of a new Palace spoilt, or a new Design committed to some rash or
impotent Pretender.

{#10} 'Tis the good Fate of our Nation in this particular, that there remain yet
two of the noblest Subjects for Architecture; our Prince's _Palace,_ and our
_House of Parliament._ For I can't but fansy that when _Whitehall_ is thought
of, the neighbouring _Lords_ and _Commons_ will at the same time be plac'd in
better Chambers and Apartments, than at present; were it only for Majesty's
sake, and as a Magnificence becoming the Person of the Prince, who here appears
in full Solemnity. Nor do I fear that when these new Subjects are attempted, we
shou'd miscarry as grosly as we have done in others before. Our _State,_ in this
respect, may prove perhaps more fortunate than our _Church,_ in having waited
till a national Taste was form'd, before these Edifices were undertaken. But the
Zeal of the Nation cou'd not, it seems, admit so long a Delay in their
Ecclesiastical Structures, particularly their _Metropolitan._ And since a Zeal
of this sort has been newly kindled amongst us, 'tis like we shall see from afar
the many Spires arising in our great City, with such hasty and sudden growth, as
may be the occasion perhaps that our immediate Relish shall be hereafter
censur'd, as retaining much of what Artists call the _Gothick_ Kind.

{#11} Hardly, indeed, as the Publick now stands, shou'd we bear to see a
_Whitehall_ treated like a _Hampton-Court,_ or even a new Cathedral like St.
^Paul^'s. Almost every-one now becomes concern'd, and interests himself in such
publick Structures. Even those Pieces too are brought under the common Censure,
which, tho rais'd by private Men, are of such a Grandure and Magnificence, as to
become National Ornaments. The ordinary Man may build his Cottage, or the plain
Gentleman his Country-house according as he fansys: but when a great Man builds,
he will find little Quarter from the Publick, if instead of a beautiful Pile, he
raises, at a vast expence, such a false and counterfeit Piece of Magnificence,
as can be justly arraign'd for its Deformity by so many knowing Men in Art, and
by the whole _People,_ who, in such a Conjuncture, readily follow their Opinion.

{#12} In reality _the People_ are no small Partys in this _Cause._ Nothing moves
successfully without 'em. There can be no ^Publick^, but where they are
included. And without _a Publick Voice,_ knowingly guided and directed, there is
nothing which can raise a true Ambition in the Artist; nothing which can exalt
the Genius of the Workman, or make him emulous of after-Fame, and of the
approbation of his _Country,_ and of _Posterity._ For with _these_ he naturally,
as a _Freeman,_ must take part: in _these_ he has a passionate Concern, and
Interest, rais'd in him by the same Genius of _Liberty,_ the same _Laws_ and
_Government,_ by which his Property, and the Rewards of his Pains and Industry
are secur'd to him, and to his Generation after him.

{#13} Every thing co-operates, in such a _State,_ towards the Improvement of
_Art_ and _Science._ And for the _designing Arts_ in particular, such as
_Architecture, Painting,_ and _Statuary,_ they are in a manner link'd together.
The Taste of one kind brings necessarily that of the others along with it. When
the _free_ Spirit of a Nation turns it-self this way, Judgments are form'd;
Criticks arise; the publick Eye and Ear improve; a right Taste prevails, and in
a manner forces its way. Nothing is so improving, nothing so natural, so
_con-genial_ to the liberal Arts, as that reigning Liberty and high Spirit of a
People, which from the Habit of judging in the highest Matters for themselves,
makes 'em freely judg of other Subjects, and enter thorowly into the Characters
as well of _Men_ and _Manners,_ as of the _Products_ or _Works_ of Men, in Art
and Science. So much, my Lord, do we owe to the Excellence of our National
Constitution, and Legal Monarchy; happily fitted for Us, and which alone cou'd
hold together so mighty a People; all sharers (tho at so far a distance from
each other) in the Government of _themselves;_ and meeting under _one_ Head in
_one_ vast _Metropolis;_ whose enormous Growth, however censurable in other
respects, is actually a Cause that Workmanship and Arts of so many kinds arise
to such perfection.

{#14} What Encouragement our higher Powers may think fit to give these growing
Arts, I will not pretend to guess. This I know, that 'tis so much for their
advantage and Interest to make themselves the chief Partys in the Cause, that I
wish no Court or Ministry, besides a truly virtuous and wise one, may ever
concern themselves in the Affair. For shou'd they do so, they wou'd in reality
do more harm than good; since 'tis not the Nature of a Court (such as Courts
generally are) to improve, but rather corrupt _a Taste._ And what is in the
beginning set wrong by their Example, is hardly ever afterwards recoverable in
the Genius of a Nation.

{#15} Content therefore I am, my Lord, that ^Britain^ stands in this respect as
she now does. Nor can one, methinks, with just reason regret her having hitherto
made no greater advancement in these affairs of Art. As her _Constitution_ has
grown, and been establish'd, she has in proportion fitted her-self for other
Improvements. There has been no Anticipation in the Case. And in this surely she
must be esteem'd wise, as well as happy; that ere she attempted to raise
her-self any other Taste or Relish, she secur'd her-self a right one in
_Government._ She has now the advantage of beginning in other Matters, on a new
foot. She has her _Models_ yet to seek, her _Scale_ and _Standard_ to form, with
deliberation and good choice. Able enough she is at present to shift for
her-self; however abandon'd or helpless she has been left by those whom it
became to assist her. Hardly, indeed, cou'd she procure a single _Academy_ for
the training of her Youth in Exercises. As good Soldiers as we are, and as good
Horses as our Climate affords, our Princes, rather than expend their Treasure
this way, have suffer'd our Youth to pass into a foreign Nation, to learn to
ride. As for other _Academys,_ such as those for Painting, Sculpture, or
Architecture, we have not so much as heard of the Proposal; whilst the Prince of
our rival Nation raises Academys, breeds Youth, and sends Rewards and Pensions
into foreign Countrys, to advance the Interest and Credit of his own. Now if,
notwithstanding the Industry and Pains of this foreign Court, and the supine
Un-concernedness of our own, the National Taste however rises, and already shews
it-self in many respects beyond that of our so highly-assisted Neighbours; what
greater Proof can there be of the Superiority of Genius in one of these Nations
above the other?

{#16} 'Tis but this moment that I chance to read in an Article of one of the
Gazettes from ^Paris^, that 'tis resolv'd at Court to establish a new _Academy_
for political Affairs. "In it the present Chief-Minister is to preside; having
under him six Academists, _douëz des Talens nécessaires_[n2]—No Person to be
receiv'd under the age of twenty five. A thousand Livres Pension for each
Scholar—Able Masters to be appointed for teaching them the necessary Sciences,
and instructing them in the Treatys of Peace and Alliances, which have been
formerly made—The Members to assemble three times a Week—_C'est de ce Seminaire_
(says the Writer) _qu'on tirera les Secretaires d'Ambassade; qui par degrez
pourront monter à de plus hauts Emplois._"[n3]

{#17} I must confess, my Lord, as great an Admirer as I am of these regular
Institutions, I can't but look upon _an Academy for Ministers_ as a very
extraordinary Establishment; especially in such a Monarchy as ^France^, and at
such a Conjuncture as the present. It looks as if the Ministers of that Court
had discover'd lately some new Methods of Negotiation, such as their
Predecessors ^Richelieu^ and ^Mazarine^ never thought of; or that, on the
contrary, they have found themselves so declin'd, and at such a loss in the
Management of this present Treaty, as to be forc'd to take their Lesson from
some of those Ministers with whom they treat: a Reproach, of which, no doubt,
they must be highly sensible.

{#18} But 'tis not my design here, to entertain your Lordship with any
Reflections upon Politicks, or the Methods which the ^French^ may take to raise
themselves _new_ Ministers, or _new_ Generals; who may prove a better Match for
us than hitherto, whilst we held our _old._ I will only say to your Lordship on
this Subject of _Academys;_ that indeed I have less concern for the Deficiency
of such a one as this, than of any other which cou'd be thought of, for
^England^; and that as for a Seminary of _Statesmen,_ I doubt not but, without
this extraordinary help, we shall be able, out of our _old_ Stock, and the
common course of Business, constantly to furnish a sufficient Number of
well-qualify'd Persons to serve upon occasion, either at home, or in our foreign
Treatys; as often as such Persons accordingly qualify'd shall duly, honestly,
and _bonâ fide_ be requir'd to serve.

{#19} I return therefore to my _Virtuoso_-Science; which being my chief
Amusement in this Place and Circumstance, your Lordship has by it a fresh
Instance that I can never employ my Thoughts with satisfaction on any Subject,
without making you a Party. For even this very ^Notion^ had its rise chiefly
from the Conversation of a certain Day, which I had the happiness to pass a few
years since in the Country with your Lordship. 'Twas there you shew'd me some
Ingravings, which had been sent you from ^Italy^. One in particular I well
remember; of which the Subject was the very same with that of my written
^Notion^ inclos'd. But by what Hand it was done, or after what Master, or how
executed, I have quite forgot. 'Twas the Summer-season, when you had Recess from
Business. And I have accordingly calculated this _Epistle_ and _Project_ for the
same Recess and Leisure. For by the time this can reach ^England^, the Spring
will be far advanc'd, and the national Affairs in a manner over, with those who
are not in _the immediate Administration._

{#20} Were _that_ indeed your Lordship's Lot, at present; I know not whether in
regard to my Country I shou'd dare throw such Amusements as these in your way.
Yet even in this Case, I wou'd venture to say however, in defense of my Project,
and of the _Cause of Painting;_ that cou'd my young Hero come to your Lordship
as well represented as he might have been, either by the Hand of a [n4]^Marat^
or a ^Jordano^, (the Masters who were in being, and in repute, when I first
travel'd here in ^Italy^) the _Picture_ it-self, whatever the _Treatise_ prov'd,
wou'd have been worth notice, and might have become a Present worthy of our
Court, and Prince's _Palace;_ especially were it so bless'd as to lodge within
it a royal Issue of her Majesty's. Such a Piece of Furniture might well fit the
Gallery, or Hall of Exercises, where our young Princes shou'd learn their usual
Lessons. And to see ^Virtue^ in this Garb and Action, might perhaps be no slight
Memorandum hereafter to _a Royal Youth,_ who shou'd one day come to undergo this
Trial himself; on which his own Happiness, as well as the Fate of ^Europe^ and
of the World, wou'd in so great a measure depend.

{#21} This, my Lord, is making (as you see) the most I can of my _Project,_ and
setting off my Amusements with the best Colour I am able; that I may be the more
excusable in communicating them to your Lordship, and expressing thus, with what
Zeal I am,

{#n1} Ante omnia Musae.

{#n2} endowed with the necessary Talents

{#n3} It is from this group (says the Writer) that will be drawn Secretaries of
Ambassadors and gradually they will rise to the highest Offices.

{#n4} _Carlo Marat_ was yet alive, at the time this Letter was written; but had
been long super-annuated, and incapable of any considerable Performance.
