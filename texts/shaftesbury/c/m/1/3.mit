{#1} YOU shall find then, said I (taking a grave Air) that it is possible for me
to be serious; and that 'tis probable I am growing so, for good and all. Your
Over-seriousness a-while since, at such an unseasonable time, may have driven me
perhaps into a contrary Extreme, by opposition to your melancholy Humour. But I
have now a better Idea of that _Melan__choly_ you discover'd; and
notwithstanding the humorous Turn you were pleas'd to give it, I am persuaded it
has a different Foundation from any of those fantastical Causes I then assign'd
to it. "^Love,^ #LOVE.# doubtless, is at the bottom; but a nobler Love than such
as common Beautys inspire."—

{#2} Here, in my turn, I began to raise my Voice, and imitate the solemn way you
had been teaching me. "_Knowing_ as you are," continu'd I, "_well-knowing_ and
experienc'd in all the Degrees and Orders of Beauty, #Beauty.# in all the
mysterious Charms of the particular Forms; you rise to what is more general; and
with a larger Heart, and Mind more comprehensive, you generously seek that which
is highest in the kind. Not captivated by the Lineaments of a fair Face, or the
well-drawn Proportions of a human Body, you view _the Life_ it-self, and embrace
rather _the Mind,_ which adds the Lustre, and renders chiefly amiable."

{#3} #Society.# "Nor is the Enjoyment of such a single Beauty sufficient to
satisfy such an aspiring Soul. It seeks how to combine more Beautys, and by what
Coalition of these, to form a beautiful Society. It views Communitys,
Friendships, Relations, Dutys; and considers by what Harmony of particular Minds
the general Harmony is compos'd, and _Commonweal_ establish'd."

{#4} "Nor satisfy'd even with publick Good in _one_ Community of Men, it frames
it-self a nobler Object, #Virtue.# and with enlarg'd Affection seeks _the Good
of Mankind._ It dwells with Pleasure amidst that Reason, and those Orders on
which this fair Correspondence and goodly Interest is establish'd. Laws,
Constitutions, civil and religious Rites; whatever civilizes or polishes rude
Mankind; the Sciences and Arts, Philosophy, Morals, Virtue; the flourishing
State of human Affairs, and the Perfection of human Nature; these are its
delightful Prospects, and this the Charm of Beauty which attracts it."

{#5} #Universe.# "Still ardent in this Pursuit (such is its Love of Order and
Perfection) it rests not here; nor satisfies it-self with the Beauty of a Part;
but extending further its communicative Bounty, seeks the Good of All, and
affects the Interest and Prosperity of _the Whole._ True to its native World and
higher Country, 'tis here it seeks Order and Perfection; wishing the best, and
hoping still to find a just and wise Administration."

{#6} "And since all Hope of this were vain and idle, if no _universal Mind_
presided; #GOD.# since without such a supreme Intelligence and providential
Care, the distracted Universe must be condemn'd to suffer infinite Calamitys;
'tis here the generous Mind labours to discover that _healing Cause_ by which
the Interest of _the Whole_ is securely establish'd, the Beauty of Things, and
the universal Order happily sustain'd."

{#7} #Ill _natural and moral._# "This, ^Palemon,^ is the Labour of your Soul:
and This its _Melancholy;_ when unsuccessfully pursuing the supreme Beauty, it
meets with darkning Clouds which intercept its Sight. Monsters arise, not those
from _Lybian_ Desarts, but from the Heart of Man more fertile; and with their
horrid Aspect cast an unseemly Reflection upon ^Nature.^ She, helpless (as she
is thought) and working thus absurdly, is contemn'd, the Government of the World
arraign'd, and ^Deity^ made void."

{#8} "Much is alledg'd in answer, to shew why _Nature_ errs, and how she came
thus impotent and erring from an unerring Hand. But I deny she errs; and when
she seems most ignorant or perverse in her Productions, I assert her even then
as wise and provident, as in her goodliest Works. For 'tis not then that Men
complain of the World's Order, or abhor the Face of things, when they see
various Interests mix'd and interfering; Natures subordinate, of different
kinds, oppos'd one to another, and in their different Operations submitted, the
higher to the lower. 'Tis on the contrary, from this Order of inferior and
superior Things, that we admire the[n1] World's Beauty, founded thus _on
Contrarietys:_ whilst from such various and disagreeing Principles, _a universal
Concord_ is establish'd."

{#9} "Thus in the several Orders of terrestrial Forms, _a Resignation_ is
requir'd, a Sacrifice and mutual yielding of Natures one to another. The
Vegetables by their Death sustain the Animals: and Animal Bodys dissolv'd,
enrich the Earth, and raise again the vegetable World. The numerous Insects are
reduc'd by the superior Kinds of Birds and Beasts: and these again are check'd
by Man; who in his turn submits to other Natures, and resigns his Form a
Sacrifice in common to the rest of Things. And if in Natures so little exalted
or pre-eminent above each other, the Sacrifice of Interests can appear so just;
how much more reasonably may all inferior Natures be subjected to _the superior
Nature_ of the World! That World, ^Palemon,^ which even now transported you,
when the Sun's fainting Light gave way to these bright Constellations, and left
you this wide System to contemplate."

{#10} "Here are those _Laws_ which ought not, nor can submit to any thing below.
The central Powers, which hold the lasting Orbs in their just Poize and
Movement, must not be controul'd to save a fleeting Form, and rescue from the
Precipice a puny Animal, whose brittle Frame, howe'er protected, must of it-self
so soon dissolve. The ambient Air, the inward Vapours, the impending Meteors, or
whatever else is nutrimental or preservative of this Earth, must operate in a
natural Course: and other Constitutions must submit to the good Habit and
Constitution of the all-sustaining Globe."

{#11} "Let us not therefore wonder, if by Earthquakes, Storms, pestilential
Blasts, nether or upper Fires, or Floods, the animal Kinds are oft afflicted,
and whole Species perhaps involv'd at once in common Ruin: But much less let us
account it strange, if either by outward Shock, or some interior Wound from
hostile Matter, particular Animals are deform'd even in their first Conception,
when the Disease invades the Seats of Generation, and seminal Parts are injur'd
and obstructed in their accurate Labours. 'Tis then alone that monstrous Shapes
are seen: Nature still working as before, and not perversly or erroneously; not
faintly, or with feeble Endeavours; but o'erpower'd by _a superior Rival,_ and
by another Nature's _justly_ conquering Force."

{#12} "Nor need we wonder, if the interior Form, _the Soul_ and _Temper,_
partakes of this occasional Deformity, and sympathizes often with its close
Partner. Who is there can wonder either at the Sicknesses of Sense, or the
Depravity of Minds inclos'd in such frail Bodys, and dependent on such
pervertible Organs?"

{#13} #Good.# "Here then is that Solution you require: and hence those seeming
Blemishes cast upon Nature. Nor is there ought in this beside what is natural
and good. 'Tis _Good_ which is predominant; and every corruptible and mortal
Nature by its Mortality and Corruption yields only to some better, and all in
common to that _best and highest Nature,_ which is incorruptible and immortal."

{#14} I SCARCE had ended these Words, ere you broke out in admiration; asking
what had befall'n me, that of a sudden I had thus chang'd my Character, and
enter'd into Thoughts, which must certainly, you suppos'd, have some Foundation
in me, since I cou'd express them with such seeming Affection as I had done.

{#15} O, said I, ^Palemon!^ that it had been my fortune to have met you the
other day, just at my Return out of the Country from _a Friend,_ whose
Conversation had in one day or _two_ made such an Impression on me, that I
shou'd have suted you to a Miracle. You wou'd have thought indeed that I had
been cur'd of my _Scepticism_ and Levity, so as never to have rally'd more, at
that wild rate, on any Subject, much less on these which are so serious.

{#16} Truly, said you, I cou'd wish I had met you rather at that time, or that
those good and serious Impressions of your _Friend_ had without interruption
lasted with you till this moment.

{#17} Whatever they were, I told you, ^Palemon,^ I had not so lost 'em neither,
as not easily, you saw, to revive 'em on occasion; were I not afraid. "Afraid!"
said you. "For whose sake, good ^Philocles,^ I intreat you? For mine or your
own?" "For both," reply'd I. "For tho I was like to be perfectly cur'd of my
_Scepticism;_ 'twas by what I thought worse, #Enthusiast.# downright
_Enthusiasm._ You never knew a more agreeable ^Enthusiast!^ "

{#18} Were he my Friend, said you, I shou'd hardly treat him in so free a
manner. Nor shou'd I, perhaps, judg that to be _Enthusiasm_ which you so freely
term so. I have a strong suspicion that you injure him. Nor can I be satisfy'd
till I hear further of that serious Conversation for which you tax him as
_Enthusiastick._

{#19} I must confess, said I, he had nothing of that savage Air of the vulgar
enthusiastick Kind. All was serene, soft, and harmonious. The manner of it was
more after the pleasing Transports of those antient _Poets_ you are often
charm'd with, than after the fierce unsociable way of modern _Zealots;_ those
starch'd gruff Gentlemen, who guard Religion as Bullys do a Mistress, and give
us the while a very indifferent Opinion of their Lady's Merit, and their own
Wit, by adoring what they neither allow to be inspected by others, nor care
themselves to examine in a fair light. But here I'll answer for it; there was
nothing of Disguise or Paint. All was fair, open, and genuine, as Nature
herself. 'Twas _Nature_ he was in love with: 'Twas _Nature_ he sung. And if
any-one might be said to have _a natural_ Mistress, my Friend certainly might,
whose Heart was thus ingag'd. But ^Love,^ I found, was every-where the same. And
tho the Object here was very fine, and the Passion it created very noble; yet
_Liberty,_ I thought, was finer than all: And I who never car'd to ingage in
other Loves of the least continuance, was the more afraid, I told you, of this
which had such a power with my poor _Friend,_ as to make him appear the
perfectest ^Enthusiast^ in the World, _Ill-humour_ only excepted. For this was
singular in him, "That tho he had all of the _Enthusiast,_ he had nothing of the
_Bigot._ He heard every thing with Mildness and Delight; and bore with me when I
treated all his Thoughts as visionary; and when, Sceptick-like, I unravel'd all
his Systems."

{#20} Here was that _Character_ and _Description_ which so highly pleas'd you,
that you wou'd hardly suffer me to come to a conclusion. 'Twas impossible, I
found, to give you satisfaction, without reciting the main of what pass'd in
those _two_ days between my _Friend_ and me, in our Country-Retirement. Again
and again I bid you beware: "You knew not the danger of this _philosophical
Passion;_ nor consider'd what you might possibly draw upon your-self, and make
me the Author of. I was far enough engag'd already: and you were pushing me
further, at your own hazard."

{#21} All I cou'd say made not the least impression on you. But rather than
proceed any further this night, I engag'd, for your sake, to turn _Writer,_ and
draw up the Memoirs of those _two_ philosophical Days; beginning with what had
pass'd this _last_ Day between our-selves; as I have accordingly done, you see,
by way of _Introduction_ to my Story.

{#22} BY this time, being got late to Town, some hours after the latest of our
Company, you set me down at my own Lodging; and thus we bad Good-night.

Author on _the World._
