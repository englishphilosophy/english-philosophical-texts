£1 Conclusion £1

{#1} THUS have we endeavour'd to prove what was propos'd in the beginning. And
since in the common and known Sense of _Vice_ and _Illness,_ no-one can be
vitious or ill, except either,

{#2} It must follow, that if each of these are pernicious and destructive to the
Creature, insomuch that his compleatest State of Misery is made from hence; ^To
be wicked or vitious, is to be miserable and unhappy^.

{#3} And since every vitious Action must in proportion, more or less, help
towards this Mischief, and _Self-ill;_ it must follow, #Conclusion.# That ^every
vitious action must be self-injurious and ill^.

{#4} On the other side; _the Happiness_ and _Good_ of ^Virtue^ has been prov'd
from the contrary Effect of other Affections, such as are according to _Nature,_
and the OEconomy of the Species or Kind. We have cast up all those Particulars,
from whence (as by way of Addition and Subtraction) the main _Sum_ or general
Account of Happiness, is either augmented or diminish'd. And if there be no
Article exceptionable in this Scheme of _Moral Arithmetick;_ the Subject treated
may be said to have an Evidence as great as that which is found in Numbers, or
Mathematicks. For let us carry _Scepticism_ ever so far, let us doubt, if we
can, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes _within
our-selves._ Our Passions and Affections are known to us. _They_ are certain,
whatever the _Objects_ may be, on which they are employ'd. Nor is it of any
concern to our Argument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are
Realitys, or mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For _ill Dreams_ will be
equally disturbing. And a good _Dream,_ if Life be nothing else, will be easily
and happily pass'd. In this Dream of Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have
the same force; our _Balance_ and _OEconomy_ hold good, and our Obligation to
^Virtue^ is in every respect the same.

{#5} Upon the whole: There is not, I presume, the least degree of Certainty
wanting in what has been said concerning the Preferableness of _the mental
Pleasures to the_ _sensual;_ and even _of the sensual, accompany'd with good
Affection, and under a temperate and right use,_ to those which are _no ways
restrain'd, nor supported by any thing social or affectionate._

{#6} Nor is there less Evidence in what has been said, of _the united Structure
and Fabrick of the Mind,_ and of those Passions which constitute _the Temper,_
or Soul; and on which its Happiness or Misery so immediately depend. It has been
shewn, That in _this Constitution,_ the impairing of any one Part must instantly
tend to the disorder and ruin of other Parts, and of the Whole it-self; thro'
the necessary _Connexion_ and _Balance_ of the Affections: That those very
Passions thro' which Men are vitious, are of themselves a Torment and Disease;
and that whatsoever is done which is knowingly _ill,_ must be of _ill
Consciousness;_ and in proportion, as the Act is ill, must impair and corrupt
social Enjoyment, and destroy both _the Capacity of kind Affection, and the
Consciousness of meriting any such._ So that neither can we _participate_ thus
in Joy or Happiness with others, or receive Satisfaction _from the mutual
Kindness or imagin'd Love of others:_ on which, however, the greatest of all our
Pleasures are founded.

{#7} If this be the Case of moral Delinquency; and if the State which is
consequent to this _Defection_ from Nature, be of all other the most horrid,
oppressive, and miserable; 'twill appear, "_That to yield or consent to any
thing ill or immoral, is a Breach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills_":
and, "That on the other side, _Every thing which is an Improvement of Virtue, or
an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an Advancement of
Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid Happiness and Enjoyment._"

{#8} Thus the Wisdom of what rules, and is ^first^ and ^chief^ _in Nature,_ has
made it to be according to the _private Interest_ and _Good_ of every-one, to
work towards the _general Good;_ which if a Creature ceases to promote, he is
actually so far wanting to himself, and ceases to promote his own Happiness and
Welfare. He is, on this account, directly his own Enemy: Nor can he any
otherwise be good or useful to himself, than as he continues good to Society,
and to that _Whole_ of which he is himself _a Part._ So that ^Virtue^, which of
all Excellencys and Beautys is the chief, and most amiable; _that_ which is the
Prop and Ornament of human Affairs; which upholds Communitys, maintains Union,
Friendship, and Correspondence amongst Men; _that_ by which Countrys, as well as
private Familys, flourish and are happy; and for want of which, every-thing
comely, conspicuous, great and worthy, must perish, and go to ruin; _that single
Quality,_ thus beneficial to all Society, and to Mankind _in general,_ is found
equally a Happiness and Good to each Creature _in particular;_ and is _that_ by
which alone Man can be happy, and without which he must be miserable.

{#9} And, thus, ^Virtue^ is _the Good,_ and ^Vice^ _the Ill_ of every-one.
