{#1} #Sensible and rational Objects.# UPON the whole. As to those Creatures
which are only capable of being mov'd by _sensible Objects;_ they are
accordingly _good_ or _vitious,_ as the sensible Affections stand with them.
'Tis otherwise in Creatures capable of framing _rational Objects_ of moral Good.
For in one of this kind, shou'd the _sensible Affections_ stand ever so much
amiss; yet if they prevail not, because of those other _rational Affections_
spoken of; 'tis evident, the Temper still holds good in the main; and the Person
is with justice esteem'd virtuous by all Men.

{#2} #Trial of Virtue.# More than this. If by Temper any one is passionate,
angry, fearful, amorous; yet resists these Passions, and notwithstanding the
force of their Impression, adheres to _Virtue;_ we say commonly in this case,
_that the Virtue is the greater:_ and we say well. Tho if that which restrains
the Person, and holds him to a virtuous-like Behaviour, be no Affection towards
Goodness or Virtue it-self, but towards private Good merely, he is not in
reality the more virtuous; as has been shewn before. But this still is evident,
that if voluntarily, and without foreign Constraint, an angry Temper bears, or
an amorous one refrains, so that neither any cruel or immodest Action can be
forc'd from such a Person, tho ever so strongly tempted by his Constitution; we
applaud his Virtue above what we shou'd naturally do, if he were free of this
Temptation, and these Propensitys. At the same time, there is no body will say
that a Propensity to Vice can be an Ingredient in Virtue, or any way necessary
to compleat a virtuous Character.

{#3} There seems therefore to be some kind of difficulty in the Case: but it
amounts only to this. If there be any part of the Temper in which ill Passions
or Affections are seated, whilst in another part the Affections towards moral
Good are such as absolutely to master those Attempts of their Antagonists; this
is the greatest _Proof_ imaginable, that a strong Principle of Virtue lies at
the bottom, and has possess'd it-self of the natural Temper. Whereas if there be
no ill Passions stirring, a Person may be indeed more _cheaply virtuous;_ that
is to say, he may conform himself to the known Rules of Virtue, without sharing
so much of a virtuous Principle as another. Yet if that other Person, who has
the Principle of Virtue so strongly implanted, comes at last to lose those
contrary Impediments suppos'd in him, he certainly loses nothing in Virtue; but
on the contrary, losing only what is vitious in his Temper, is left more intire
to Virtue, and possesses it in a higher degree.

{#4} #Degrees of Virtue.# Thus is _Virtue_ shar'd in different degrees by
rational Creatures; such at least as are call'd _rational;_ but who come short
of that sound and well-establish'd Reason, which alone can constitute a _just
Affection,_ a uniform and steddy _Will_ and _Resolution._ And thus Vice and
Virtue are found variously mix'd, and alternately prevalent in the several
Characters of Mankind. For it seems evident from our _Inquiry,_ that how ill
soever the Temper or Passions may stand with respect either to the sensible or
the moral Objects; however passionate, furious, lustful, or cruel any Creature
may become; however vitious the Mind be, or whatever ill Rules or Principles it
goes by; yet if there be any Flexibleness or favourable Inclination towards the
least moral Object, the least appearance of moral Good (as if there be any such
thing as _Kindness, Gratitude, Bounty,_ or _Compassion_), there is still
something of _Virtue_ left; and the Creature is not wholly vitious and
unnatural.

{#5} Thus a Ruffian, who out of a sense of Fidelity and Honour of any kind,
refuses to discover his Associates; and rather than betray them, is content to
endure Torments and Death; has certainly some Principle of Virtue, however he
may misapply it. 'Twas the same Case with that Malefactor, who rather than do
the Office of Executioner to his Companions, chose to keep 'em company in their
Execution.

{#6} In short: As it seems hard to pronounce of any Man, "That he is _absolutely
an Atheist_"; so it appears altogether as hard to pronounce of any Man, "That he
is _absolutely corrupt or vitious_"; there being few, even of the horridest
Villains, who have not something of _Virtue_ in this imperfect sense. Nothing is
more just than a known saying, "_That it is as hard to find a Man wholly Ill, as
wholly Good_": because wherever there is any good Affection left, there is
certainly some _Goodness_ or _Virtue_ still in being.

{#7} And, having consider'd thus of ^Virtue^, _What it is in it-self;_ we may
now consider how it stands _with respect to the Opinions concerning a_ ^Deity^,
as above-mention'd.
