{#1} #_SYSTEM explain'd._# IT has been shewn before, that no Animal can be said
properly _to act,_ otherwise than thro' Affections or Passions, such as are
proper to an Animal. For in convulsive Fits, where a Creature strikes either
himself or others, 'tis a simple Mechanism, an Engine, or Piece of Clock-work,
which acts, and not the Animal.

{#2} #_Spring of Actions._# Whatsoever therefore is done or acted by any Animal
_as such,_ is done only thro' some Affection or Passion, as of Fear, Love, or
Hatred moving him.

{#3} And as it is impossible that a weaker Affection shou'd overcome a stronger,
so it is impossible but that where the Affections or Passions are strongest in
the main, and form in general the most considerable Party, either by their Force
or Number; thither the Animal must incline: And according to this _Balance_ he
must be govern'd, and led to Action.

{#4} #_Affections, three kinds._# The Affections or Passions which must
influence and govern the Animal, are either,

{#5} So that according as these Affections stand, a Creature must be virtuous or
vitious, good or ill.

{#6} The _latter_ sort of these Affections, 'tis evident, are wholly vitious.
The _two former_ may be vitious or virtuous, according to their degree.

{#7} It may seem strange, perhaps, to speak of natural Affections as _too
strong,_ #_Degrees of Affection._# or of Self-affections as _too weak._ But to
clear this Difficulty, we must call to mind what has been already explain'd,
"That _natural Affection_ may, in particular Cases, be excessive, and in an
unnatural degree": As when Pity is so overcoming as to destroy its own End, and
prevent the Succour and Relief requir'd; or as when Love to the Offspring proves
such a Fondness as destroys the Parent, and consequently the Offspring it-self.
And notwithstanding it may seem harsh to call that _unnatural_ and _vitious,_
which is only an Extreme of some natural and kind Affection; yet 'tis most
certain, that where-ever any single good Affection of this sort is over-great,
it must be injurious to the rest, and detract in some measure from their Force
and natural Operation. For a Creature possess'd with such an immoderate Degree
of Passion, must of necessity allow too much to that _one,_ and too little to
_others_ of the same Character, and equally natural and useful as to their End.
And this must necessarily be the occasion of Partiality and Injustice, whilst
only _one Duty_ or _natural Part_ is earnestly follow'd; and _other Parts_ or
_Dutys_ neglected, which shou'd accompany it, and perhaps take place and be
prefer'd.

{#8} This may well be allow'd true in all other respects; since even ^Religion^
it-self, consider'd as _a Passion,_ not of the _selfish_ but _nobler_ kind, may
in some Characters be strain'd beyond its natural Proportion, and be said also
to be _in too high a degree._ For as the End of Religion is to render us more
perfect, and accomplish'd in all moral Dutys and Performances; if by the height
of devout Extasy and Contemplation we are rather disabled in this respect, and
render'd more unapt to the real Dutys and Offices of civil Life; it may be said
that ^Religion^ indeed is then _too strong_ in us. For how, possibly, can we
call this ^Superstition^, whilst the Object of the Devotion is acknowledg'd
just, and the Faith orthodox? 'Tis only the Excess of Zeal, which, in this Case,
is so transporting, as to render the devout Person more remiss in secular
Affairs, and less concern'd for the inferior and temporal Interests of Mankind.

{#9} Now as in particular Cases, _publick Affection,_ on the one hand, may be
_too high;_ so _private Affection_ may, on the other hand, be _too weak._ For if
a Creature be self-neglectful, and insensible of Danger; or if he want such a
degree of Passion in any kind, as is useful to preserve, sustain, or defend
himself; this must certainly be esteem'd vitious, in regard of the Design and
End of Nature. She her-self discovers this in her known Method and stated Rule
of Operation. 'Tis certain, that her provisionary Care and Concern for the whole
Animal, must at least be equal to her Concern for a single Part or Member. Now
to the several Parts she has given, we see proper Affections, sutable to their
Interest and Security; so that even without our Consciousness, they act in their
own Defense, and for their own Benefit and Preservation. Thus _an Eye,_ in its
natural State, fails not to shut together, of its own accord, unknowingly to us,
by a peculiar Caution and Timidity; which if it wanted, however we might intend
the Preservation of our Eye, we shou'd not in effect be able to preserve it, by
any Observation or Forecast of our own. To be wanting therefore in those
principal Affections, which respect the Good of the whole Constitution, must be
a Vice and Imperfection, as great surely in the principal part, (the Soul or
Temper) as it is in any of those inferior and subordinate parts, to want the
self-preserving Affections which are proper to them.

{#10} And thus the Affections towards private Good become necessary and
essential to Goodness. For tho no Creature can be call'd good, or virtuous,
merely for possessing these Affections; yet since it is impossible that the
publick Good, or Good of the System, can be preserv'd without them; it follows
that a Creature really wanting in them, is in reality wanting in some degree to
Goodness and natural Rectitude; and may thus be esteem'd vitious and defective.

{#11} 'Tis thus we say of a Creature, in a kind way of Reproof, that he is _too
good;_ when his Affection towards others is so warm and zealous, as to carry him
even beyond his _Part;_ or when he really acts beyond it, not thro' too warm a
Passion of that sort, but thro' an over-cool one of another, or thro' want of
some Self-passion to restrain him within due Bounds.

{#12} It may be objected here, that the having the natural Affections too
strong, (where the Self-affections are over-much so) or the having the
Self-affections defective or weak, (where the natural Affections are also weak)
may prove upon occasion the only Cause of a Creature's acting honestly and in
moral proportion. For, thus, one who is to a fault regardless of his Life, may
with the smallest degree of natural Affection do all which can be expected from
the highest Pitch of social Love, or zealous Friendship. And thus, on the other
hand, a Creature excessively timorous may, by as exceeding a degree of natural
Affection, perform whatever the perfectest Courage is able to inspire.

{#13} To this it is answer'd, That whenever we arraign any Passion as _too
strong,_ or complain of any as _too weak;_ we must speak with respect to a
certain Constitution or _OEconomy_ of a particular Creature, or Species. For if
a Passion, leading to any right end, be only so much the more serviceable and
effectual, for being strong; if we may be assur'd that the strength of it will
not be the occasion of any disturbance within, nor of any disproportion between
it-self and other Affections; then consequently the Passion, however strong,
cannot be condemn'd as vitious. But if to have _all_ the Passions in equal
proportion with it, be what the Constitution of the Creature cannot bear; so
that only _some_ Passions are rais'd to this height, whilst _others_ are not,
nor can possibly be wrought up to the same proportion; then may those strong
Passions, tho of the better kind, be call'd excessive. For being in unequal
proportion to the others, and causing an _ill Balance_ in the Affection at
large, they must of course be the occasion of Inequality in the Conduct, and
incline the Party to a wrong moral Practice.

{#14} #_OEconomy of the Passions._# But to shew more particularly what is meant
by the _OEconomy of the Passions,_ from Instances in the Species or[n1] Kinds
below us. As for the Creatures who have no manner of Power or Means given them
by Nature for their defense against Violence, nor any-thing by which they can
make themselves formidable to such as injure or offend them; 'tis necessary they
shou'd have an extraordinary degree of Fear, but little or no Animosity, such as
might cause 'em to make resistance, or incline 'em to delay their Flight. For in
this their Safety lies, and to this the Passion of Fear is serviceable, by
keeping the Senses on the watch, and holding the Spirits in readiness to give
the start.

{#15} And thus _Timorousness,_ and an habitual strong Passion of Fear, may be
_according to the OEconomy_ of a particular Creature, both with respect to
himself, and to the rest of his Species. On the other hand, _Courage_ may be
_contrary to his OEconomy,_ and therefore vitious. Even in one and the same
Species, this is by Nature differently order'd, with respect to different Sexes,
Ages, and Growths. The tamer Creatures of the grazing kind, who live in Herds,
are different from the wilder, who herd not, but live in Pairs only, apart from
Company, as is natural and sutable to their rapacious Life. Yet is there found,
even among the former inoffensive kind, a _Courage_ proportionable to their Make
and Strength. At a time of danger, when the whole Herd flies, the _Bull_ alone
makes head against the Lion, or whatever other invading Beast of Prey, and shews
himself conscious of his _Make._ Even the Female of this kind is arm'd, we see,
by Nature, in some degree, to resist Violence; so as not to fly a common Danger.
As for a Hind, or Doe, or any other inoffensive and mere defenceless Creature;
'tis no way unnatural or vitious in them, when the Enemy approaches, to desert
their Offspring, and fly for Safety. But for Creatures who are able to make
Resistance, and are by Nature arm'd offensively; be they of the poorest
Insect-kind, such as Bees or Wasps; 'tis natural to 'em to be rouz'd with Fury,
and at the hazard of their Lives, oppose any Enemy or Invader of their Species.
For by this known Passion in the Creature, the Species it-self is secur'd; when
by Experience 'tis found that the Creature, tho unable to repel the Injury, yet
voluntarily exposes his Life for the Punishment of the Invader; and suffers not
his Kind to be injur'd with Impunity. And of all other Creatures, _Man_ is in
this Sense the most formidable: since if he thinks it just and exemplary, he may
possibly in his own, or in his Country's Cause, revenge an Injury on any-one
living; and by throwing away his own Life (if he be resolute to that degree) is
almost certain Master of another's, however strongly guarded. Examples of this
nature have often serv'd to restrain those in Power, from using it to the utmost
Extent, and urging their Inferiors to Extremity.

{#16} #_Measure. Tone._# Upon the whole: It may be said properly to be the same
with the Affections or Passions in an Animal-Constitution, as with the Cords or
Strings of a Musical Instrument. If these, tho in ever so just proportion one to
another, are strain'd beyond a certain degree, 'tis more than the Instrument
will bear: The Lute or Lyre is abus'd, and its Effect lost. On the other hand,
if while some of the Strings are duly strain'd, others are not wound up to their
due proportion; then is the Instrument still in disorder, and its Part ill
perform'd. The several Species of Creatures are like different sorts of
Instruments: And even in the same Species of Creatures (as in the same sort of
Instrument) _one_ is not intirely like the _other,_ nor will the same Strings
fit each. The same degree of Strength which winds up _one,_ and fits the several
Strings to a just Harmony and Concert, may in _another_ burst both the Strings
and Instrument it-self. Thus Men who have the liveliest Sense, and are the
easiest affected with Pain or Pleasure, have need of the strongest Influence or
Force of other Affections, such as Tenderness, Love, Sociableness, Compassion,
in order to preserve _a right_ ^Balance^ _within,_ #_Balance._# and to maintain
them in their Duty, and in the just performance of their Part: whilst others,
who are of a cooler Blood, or lower Key, need not the same Allay or Counterpart;
nor are made by Nature to feel those tender and indearing Affections in so
exquisite a degree.

{#17} It might be agreeable, one wou'd think, to inquire thus into the different
_Tunings_ of the Passions, the various Mixtures and Allays by which Men become
so different from one another. #_TEMPER._# For as the highest Improvements of
Temper are made in human kind; #_Best or worst in_ Man.# so the greatest
Corruptions and Degeneracys are discoverable in this Race. In the other Species
of Creatures around us, there is found generally an exact Proportionableness,
Constancy and Regularity in all their Passions and Affections; no failure in the
care of the Offspring, or of the Society, to which they are united; no
Prostitution of themselves; no Intemperance, or Excess, in any kind. The smaller
Creatures, who live as it were in Citys (as Bees and Ants) continue the same
Train and Harmony of Life: Nor are they ever false to those Affections, which
move them to operate towards their Publick Good. Even those Creatures of Prey,
who live the farthest out of Society, maintain, we see, such a Conduct towards
one another, as is exactly sutable to the Good of their own Species. Whilst Man,
notwithstanding the Assistance of Religion, and the Direction of Laws, is often
found to live in less conformity with Nature; and, by means of Religion it-self,
is often render'd the more barbarous and inhuman. Marks are set on Men:
Distinctions form'd: Opinions decreed, under the severest Penaltys: Antipathys
instill'd, and Aversions rais'd in Men against the generality of their own
Species. So that 'tis hard to find in any Region a human Society which has
_human_ Laws. No wonder if in such Societys 'tis so hard to find a Man who lives
^naturally^, and as a Man.

{#18} #_State of the Argument._# BUT having shewn what is meant by a Passion's
being _in too high,_ or _in too low_ a degree; and that,"To have any natural
Affection too high, or any Self-affection too low," tho it be often approv'd as
_Virtue,_ is yet, strictly speaking, a _Vice_ and _Imperfection:_ we come now to
the plainer and more essential part of ^Vice^, and which alone deserves to be
consider'd _as such:_ that is to say.

{#19} Otherwise than _thus,_ it is impossible any Creature can be such as we
call ^ill^ or ^vitious^. So that if once we prove that it is really not the
Creature's Interest to be thus _vitiously_ affected, but contrariwise; we shall
then have prov'd, "That it is his Interest to be wholly ^Good^ and ^Virtuous^ ":
Since in a wholesom and sound State of his Affections, such as we have
describ'd, he cannot possibly be other than sound, _good_ and _virtuous,_ in his
Action and Behaviour.

{#20} Our Business, therefore, will be, to prove;
