{#1} WE have consider'd _what_ ^Virtue^ _is,_ and to whom the Character belongs.
It remains to inquire, #_Obligation to VIRTUE._# _What Obligation_ there is _to_
^Virtue^; or _what Reason_ to embrace it.

{#2} We have found, that to deserve the name of _good_ or _virtuous,_ a Creature
must have all his Inclinations and Affections, his Dispositions of Mind and
Temper, sutable, and agreeing with the Good of his _Kind,_ or of that _System_
in which he is included, and of which he constitutes a ^Part^. To stand thus
well affected, and to have one's Affections _right_ and _intire,_ not only in
respect of one's self, but of Society and the Publick: This is _Rectitude,
Integrity,_ or ^Virtue^. And to be wanting in any of these, or to have their
Contrarys, is _Depravity, Corruption,_ and ^Vice^.

{#3} #_Difficulty stated._# It has been already shewn, that in the Passions and
Affections of particular Creatures, there is a constant relation to the Interest
of _a Species,_ or _common Nature._ This has been demonstrated in the case of
_natural Affection,_ parental Kindness, Zeal for Posterity, Concern for the
Propagation and Nurture of the Young, Love of Fellowship and Company,
Compassion, mutual Succour, and the rest of this kind. Nor will any-one deny
that this Affection of a Creature towards the Good of the Species or common
Nature, is as _proper_ and _natural_ to him, as it is to any Organ, Part or
Member of an Animal-Body, or mere Vegetable, to work in its known Course, and
regular way of Growth. 'Tis not more _natural_ for the Stomach to digest, the
Lungs to breathe, the Glands to separate Juices, or other Intrails to perform
their several Offices; however they may by particular Impediments be sometimes
disorder'd, or obstructed in their Operations.

{#4} There being allow'd therefore in a Creature such Affections as these
towards _the common Nature,_ #_Union with a Kind or Species._# or _System of the
Kind,_ together with those other which regard _the private Nature,_ or
_Self-system;_ it will appear that in following the _first_ of these Affections,
the Creature must on many Occasions contradict and go against _the latter._ How
else shou'd the Species be preserv'd? Or what wou'd signify that implanted
_natural Affection,_ by which a Creature thro' so many Difficultys and Hazards
preserves its Offspring, and supports its Kind?

{#5} #_Opposition from Self-interest._# It may therefore be imagin'd, perhaps,
that there is a plain and absolute Opposition between these _two_ Habits or
Affections. It may be presum'd, that the pursuing the common Interest or publick
Good thro' the Affections of _one kind,_ must be a hindrance to the Attainment
of private Good thro' the Affections of _another._ For it being taken for
granted, that Hazards and Hardships, of whatever sort, are naturally the _Ill_
of the private State; and it being certainly the Nature of those publick
Affections to lead often to the greatest Hardships and Hazards of every kind;
'tis presently infer'd, "That 'tis the Creature's Interest to be without any
publick Affection whatsoever."

{#6} This we know for certain; That all social Love, Friendship, Gratitude, or
whatever else is of this generous kind, does by its nature take place of the
self-interesting Passions, draws us out of our-selves, and makes us disregardful
of our own Convenience and Safety. So that according to a known[n1] way of
reasoning on _Self-interest,_ that which is of a social kind in us, shou'd of
right be abolish'd. Thus Kindness of every sort, Indulgence, Tenderness,
Compassion, and in short, all natural Affection shou'd be industriously
suppress'd, and, as mere Folly, and Weakness of Nature, be resisted and
overcome; that, by this means, there might be nothing remaining in us, which was
contrary to a direct _Self-end;_ nothing which might stand in opposition to a
steddy and deliberate Pursuit of the most narrowly confin'd _Self-interest._

{#7} According to this extraordinary Hypothesis, it must be taken for granted,
"That in the System of a Kind or Species, the Interest of _the private Nature_
is directly opposite to that of _the common one;_ the Interest of _Particulars_
directly opposite to that of _the Publick in general._"—A strange Constitution!
in which it must be confess'd there is much Disorder and Untowardness; unlike to
what we observe elsewhere in Nature. As if in any vegetable or animal Body, the
_Part_ or Member cou'd be suppos'd in a good and prosperous State _as to
it-self,_ when under a contrary Disposition, and in an unnatural Growth or Habit
_as to its_ ^Whole^.

{#8} #_Reconciliation._# Now that this is in reality quite otherwise, we shall
endeavour to demonstrate; so as to make appear, "That what Men represent as an
ill Order and Constitution in the Universe, by making moral Rectitude appear
_the Ill,_ and Depravity _the Good_ or Advantage of a Creature, is in Nature
just the contrary. That to be well affected towards the _Publick Interest_ and
_one's own,_ is not only consistent, but inseparable: and that moral Rectitude,
or _Virtue,_ must accordingly be the Advantage, and _Vice_ the Injury and
Disadvantage of every Creature."
