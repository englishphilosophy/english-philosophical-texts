{#1} WHAT I had to remark of my own concerning ^Enthusiasm,^ I have thus
dispatch'd: What Others have remark'd on the same Subject, I may, as an
_Apologist_ to another Author, be allow'd to cite; especially if I take notice
only of what has been dropt very naturally by some of our most approv'd
_Authors,_ and ablest _Divines._

{#2} It has been thought an odd kind of Temerity, in our Author, to assert,[n1]
"That even ^Atheism^ it-self was not wholly exempt from _Enthusiasm;_ That there
have been in reality _Enthusiastical_ Atheists; and That even the Spirit of
_Martyrdom_ cou'd, upon occasion, exert it-self as well in _this_ Cause, as in
any _other._" Now, besides what has been intimated in the preceding Chapter, and
what in fact may be demonstrated from the Examples of ^Vaninus^ and other
Martyrs of a like Principle, we may hear an[n2] excellent and learned _Divine,_
of highest Authority at home, and Fame abroad; who after having describ'd an
_Enthusiastical Atheist_ and one _atheistically inspir'd,_ says of this very
sort of Men, "That they are _Fanaticks_ too; however that word seem to have a
more peculiar respect to _something of a_ ^Deity:^ All Atheists being that
_blind Goddess-_^Nature's^ _Fanaticks._"

{#3} And again: "All Atheists (says he) are possess'd with a certain kind of
Madness, that may be call'd[n3] _Pneumatophobia,_ that makes them have an
irrational but desperate Abhorrence from Spirits or incorporal Substances; they
being acted also, at the same time, with an _Hylomania,_ whereby they madly dote
upon _Matter,_ and devoutly worship it, as the only ^Numen.^"

{#4} What the Power of ^Extasy^ is, whether thro' _Melancholy, Wine, Love,_ or
other natural Causes, another learned[n4] Divine of our Church, in a Discourse
upon Enthusiasm, sets forth: bringing an Example from ^Aristotle,^ "of _a
Syracusean_ Poet, who never versify'd so well, as when he was _in his distracted
Fits._" But as to _Poets_ in general, compar'd with the _religious Enthusiasts,_
he says: There is this Difference; "That _a Poet_ is an Enthusiast in jest: and
_an Enthusiast_ is a Poet in good earnest."

{#5} "'Tis a strong Temptation[n5] (says the Doctor) with _a Melancholist,_ when
he feels a Storm of _Devotion_ and _Zeal_ come upon him _like a mighty Wind;_
his Heart being full of Affection, his Head pregnant with clear and sensible
Representations, and his Mouth flowing and streaming with fit and powerful
Expressions, such as would astonish an ordinary[n6] Auditory; 'tis, I say, a
shreud Temptation to him, to think it the very _Spirit of God_ that then moves
supernaturally in him; whenas all that Excess of Zeal and Affection, and Fluency
of Words, is most palpably to be resolv'd into the power of _Melancholy,_ which
is a kind of _natural Inebriation._"

{#6} The learned Doctor, with much pains afterwards, and by help of the
Peripatetick Philosophy, explains this _Enthusiastick Inebriation,_ and shews in
particular,[n7] "How the Vapours and Fumes of _Melancholy_ partake of the nature
of Wine."

{#7} One might conjecture from hence, that the malicious Opposers of early
Christianity were not unvers'd in this Philosophy; when they sophistically
objected against the apparent Force of _the Divine Spirit_ speaking in divers
Languages, and attributed it "To the Power of _new_[n8] _Wine._"

{#8} But our devout and zealous Doctor seems to go yet further. For besides what
he says of the[n9] _Enthusiastick_ Power of _Fancy_ in Atheists, he calls
_Melancholy_[n10] _a pertinacious and religious Complexion;_ and asserts, "That
there is not any true spiritual _Grace_ from God, but this mere natural
Constitution, according to the several Tempers and Workings of it, will not only
_resemble,_ but sometimes seem to _outstrip._" And after speaking of[n11]
_Prophetical_ ^Enthusiasm,^ and establishing (as our Author[n12] does) a
_Legitimate_ and a _Bastard_-sort, he asserts and justifies the[n13]
_Devotional_ ^Enthusiasm^ (as he calls it) _of holy and sincere Souls,_ and
ascribes _this_ also to ^Melancholy.^

{#9} He allows, "That the Soul may sink so far into _Phantasms,_ as not to
recover the use of her free Facultys; and that this enormous Strength of
_Imagination_ does not only beget the Belief of mad internal Apprehensions, but
is able to assure us of the Presence of _external Objects_ which _are not._" He
adds, "That what _Custom_ and _Education_ do by degrees, distemper'd ^Fancy^ may
do in a shorter time." And speaking[n14] of ^Extasy^ and the Power of
^Melancholy^ in _Extatick Fancys,_ he says, "That what _the Imagination_ then
puts forth, of herself, is as _clear_ as broad day; and the Perception of the
Soul at least as _strong_ and _vigorous,_ as at any time in beholding things
_awake._"

{#10} From whence the Doctor infers, "That the Strength of _Perception_ is no
sure Ground of Truth."

{#11} Had any other than a reverend Father of our Church express'd himself in
this manner, he must have been contented perhaps to bear a sufficient Charge of
_Scepticism._

{#12} 'Twas good fortune in my Lord ^Bacon'^ s Case, that he shou'd have escap'd
being call'd an ^Atheist,^ or a ^Sceptick,^ when speaking in a solemn manner of
the _religious Passion,_ the Ground of ^Superstition,^ or ^Enthusiasm,^ (which
he also terms[n15] _a Panick_) he derives it from an Imperfection in the
Creation, Make, or natural Constitution of Man. How far the Author of _the_[n16]
_Letter_ differs from this Author in his Opinion both of the End and Foundation
of this Passion, may appear from what has been said above. And, in general, from
what we read in the other succeeding Treatises of our Author, we may venture to
say of him with Assurance, "That he is as little a ^Sceptick^ (according to the
vulgar Sense of that word) as he is _Epicurean,_ or _Atheist._" This may be
prov'd sufficiently from his _Philosophy:_ And for any thing higher, 'tis what
he no-where presumes to treat; having forborn in particular to mention any Holy
_Mysterys_ of our Religion, or Sacred Article of our Belief.

{#13} As for what relates to[n17] _Revelation_ in general, if I mistake not our
Author's meaning, he professes _to believe,_ as far as is possible for any one
who himself had never experienc'd any _Divine Communication,_ whether by _Dream,
Vision, Apparition,_ or other _supernatural Operation;_ nor was ever present as
Eye-witness of any _Sign, Prodigy,_ or _Miracle_ whatsoever. Many of these,[n18]
he observes, are at this day pretendedly exhibited in the World, with an
Endeavour of giving them the perfect Air and exact Resemblance of those recorded
in Holy Writ. He speaks indeed with Contempt of the Mockery of _modern_ Miracles
and Inspiration. And as to all Pretences to things of this kind in our _present_
Age; he seems inclin'd to look upon 'em as no better than mere _Imposture_ or
_Delusion._ But for what is recorded of Ages heretofore, he seems to resign his
Judgment, with intire Condescension, to his Superiors. He pretends not to frame
any _certain_ or _positive_ Opinion of his own, notwithstanding his best
Searches into Antiquity, and the Nature of _religious Record_ and _Tradition:_
but on all occasions submits most willingly, and with full Confidence and Trust,
to the[n19] Opinions _by Law establish'd._ And if this be not sufficient to free
him from the Reproach of ^Scepticism,^ he must, for ought I see, be content to
undergo it.

{#14} To say truth, I have often wonder'd to find such a Disturbance rais'd
about the simple name of[n20] ^Sceptick.^ 'Tis certain that, in its original and
plain signification, the word imports no more than barely, "That State or Frame
of Mind in which every one remains, on every Subject of which he is _not
certain._" He who is _certain,_ or presumes to say _he knows,_ is in that
particular, whether he be mistaken or in the right, a ^Dogmatist.^ Between these
_two_ States or Situations of Mind, there can be no medium. For he who says,
"_That he believes for certain,_ or _is assur'd of what he believes_"; either
speaks ridiculously, or says in effect, "That _he believes strongly,_ but _is
not sure._" So that whoever is not _conscious_ of Revelation, nor has _certain
Knowledg_ of any Miracle or Sign, can be no more than ^Sceptick^ in the Case:
And the best Christian in the World, who being destitute of the means of
_Certainty,_ depends only on History and Tradition for his Belief in these
Particulars, is at best but _a Sceptick-Christian._ He has no more than a nicely
critical[n21] _Historical Faith,_ subject to various Speculations, and a
thousand different _Criticisms_ of Languages and Literature.

{#15} This he will naturally find to be the Case, if he attempts to search into
_Originals,_ in order to be _his own Judg,_ and proceed on the bottom of _his
own_ Discernment, and Understanding. If, on the other hand, he is _no Critick,_
nor competently learned in these ^Originals;^ 'tis plain he can have no
_original_ Judgment of his own; but must rely still on the _Opinion_ of those
who have opportunity to examine such matters, and whom he takes to be the
unbias'd and disinterested Judges of these _religious Narratives._ His Faith is
not in antient _Facts_ or _Persons,_ nor in the antient _Writ,_ or Primitive
_Recorders;_ nor in the successive Collators or _Conservators_ of these Records
(for of these he is unable to take cognizance): But his Confidence and Trust
must be in those _modern_ Men, or _Societys of Men,_ to whom the Publick, or He
himself, ascribes the Right to judg of these _Records,_ and commits the
Determination of _sacred Writ_ and _genuine_ Story.

{#16} Let the Person seem ever so positive or dogmatical in these high Points of
Learning; he is yet in reality no _Dogmatist,_ nor can any way free himself from
a certain kind of ^Scepticism.^ He must know himself still capable of
_Doubting:_ Or if, for fear of it, he strives to banish every opposite Thought,
and resolves not so much as to deliberate on the Case; this still will not
acquit him. So far are we from being able to _be sure_ when we have a mind; that
indeed we can never be thorowly _sure,_ but then only when we can't help it, and
find of necessity we must be so, whether we will or not. Even the highest
_implicit Faith_ is in reality no more than a kind of _passive_ ^Scepticism;^ "A
Resolution to examine, recollect, consider, or hear, as little as possible to
the prejudice of that _Belief,_ which having once espous'd we are ever
afterwards afraid to lose."

{#17} If I might be allow'd to imitate our _Author,_ in daring to touch now and
then upon the _Characters_ of our Divine _Worthys,_ I shou'd, upon this Subject
of ^Belief,^ observe how fair and generous the great _Christian_ Convert, and
_learned_ ^Apostle,^ has shewn himself in his Sacred Writings. Notwithstanding
he had himself an _original_ Testimony and _Revelation_ from Heaven, on which he
grounded his Conversion; notwithstanding he had in his own Person the Experience
of outward _Miracles_ and inward _Communications;_ he condescended still, on
many occasions, to speak _sceptically,_ and with some Hesitation and Reserve, as
to the _Certainty_ of these Divine Exhibitions. In his account of some
Transactions of this kind, himself being the Witness, and speaking (as we may
presume) of his own Person, and proper Vision,[n22] he says only that "_He knew
a Man: whether in the Body or out of it, he cannot tell. But such a one caught
up to the third Heaven, he knew formerly_ (he says) _above fourteen years_
before his then Writing." And when in another Capacity the same inspir'd Writer,
giving Precepts to his Disciples, distinguishes what[n23] he writes _by Divine
Commission_ from what he delivers _as his own Judgment_ and _private Opinion,_
he condescends nevertheless to speak as one no way positive, or Master of any
absolute _Criterion_ in the Case. And in several subsequent[n24] Passages, he
expresses himself as under some kind of Doubt how to judg or determine
certainly, "Whether he writes by Inspiration or otherwise." He only "_thinks_ he
has the Spirit." He "is not _sure,_" nor wou'd have us to depend on him as
_positive_ or _certain_ in a matter of so nice Discernment.

{#18} The holy Founders and inspir'd Authors of our Religion requir'd not, it
seems, so _strict_ an Assent, or such _implicit Faith_ in behalf of their
_original_ Writings and Revelations, as later un-inspir'd Doctors, without the
help of Divine Testimony, or any Miracle on their side, have requir'd in behalf
of their own Comments and Interpretations. The earliest and worst of
_Hereticks,_ 'tis said, were those call'd _Gnosticks,_ who took their name from
an audacious Pretence to _certain Knowledg_ and _Comprehension_ of the greatest
_Mysterys_ of Faith. If the most dangerous State of Opinion was this
_dogmatical_ and presumptuous sort; the safest, in all likelihood, must be the
_sceptical_ and modest.

{#19} There is nothing more evident than that our _Holy_ ^Religion,^ in its
original Constitution, was set so far apart from all _Philosophy_ or refin'd
_Speculation,_ that it seem'd in a manner diametrically oppos'd to it. A Man
might have been not only _a Sceptick_ in all the controverted Points of the
Academys, or Schools of Learning, but even a perfect _Stranger_ to all of this
kind; and yet compleat in his Religion, Faith, and Worship.

{#20} Among the polite Heathens of the antient World, these different Provinces
of _Religion_ and _Philosophy_ were upheld, we know, without the least
interfering with each other. If in some barbarous Nations the _Philosopher_ and
_Priest_ were join'd in one, 'tis observable that the Mysterys, whatever they
were, which sprang from this extraordinary Conjunction, were kept secret and
undivulg'd. 'Twas Satisfaction enough to the _Priest-Philosopher,_ if the
initiated Party preserv'd his Respect and Veneration for the Tradition and
Worship of the Temple, by complying in every respect with the requisite
Performances and Rites of Worship. No Account was afterwards taken of _the
Philosophick Faith_ of the Proselyte, or Worshiper. His Opinions were left to
himself, and he might philosophize according to what foreign School or Sect he
fansy'd. Even amongst the _Jews_ themselves, the ^Sadducee^ (_a Materialist,_
and Denyer of the Soul's Immortality) was as well admitted as the ^Pharisee;^
who from the Schools of ^Pythagoras,Plato,^ or other latter Philosophers of
^Greece,^ had learnt to reason upon _immaterial Substances,_ and _the natural
Immortality of Souls._

{#21} 'Tis no astonishing Reflection to observe how fast the World declin'd
in[n25] Wit and Sense, in Manhood, Reason, Science, and in every Art, when once
the ^Roman^ Empire had prevail'd, and spread an universal Tyranny and Oppression
over Mankind. Even the _Romans_ themselves, after the early Sweets of one
peaceful and long Reign, began to groan under that Yoke, of which they had been
themselves the Imposers. How much more must other Nations, and mighty Citys, at
a far distance, have abhor'd this Tyranny, and detested their common Servitude
under a People, who were themselves no better than mere Slaves?

{#22} It may be look'd upon, no doubt, as providential, that at this time, and
in these Circumstances of the World, there shou'd arise so high an expectation
of _a divine Deliverer;_ and that from the Eastern Parts and Confines of ^Judea^
the Opinion shou'd spread it-self of such _a Deliverer to come,_ with Strength
from Heaven sufficient to break that Empire, which no earthly Power remaining
cou'd be thought sufficient to encounter. Nothing cou'd have better dispos'd the
generality of Mankind, to receive the _Evangelical Advice;_ whilst they mistook
_the News,_ as many of the first Christians plainly did, and understood the
Promises of a ^Messias^ in this temporal Sense, with respect to his _second_
Coming, and _sudden_ Reign here upon _Earth._

{#23} [n26]^Superstition,^ in the mean while, cou'd not but naturally prevail,
as _Misery_ and _Ignorance_ increas'd. The ^Roman^ Emperors, as they grew more
barbarous, grew so much the more superstitious. The _Lands_ and _Revenues,_ as
well as the _Numbers_ of the Heathen Priests grew daily. And when the season
came, that by means of a Convert-Emperor, the Heathen[n27] _Church-Lands,_ with
an Increase of Power, became transfer'd to the Christian Clergy, 'twas no wonder
if by such Riches and Authority they were in no small measure influenc'd and
corrupted; as may be gather'd even from the Accounts given us of these matters
by themselves.

{#24} When, together with this, the _Schools_ of the antient[n28] Philosophers,
which had been long in their Decline, came now to be dissolv'd, and their
sophistick Teachers became Ecclesiastical Instructors; the unnatural Union of
_Religion_ and _Philosophy_ was compleated, and the monstrous Product of this
Match appear'd soon in the World. The odd exterior Shapes of Deitys, Temples,
and holy Utensils, which by the[n29] ^Egyptian^ Sects had been formerly set in
battel against each other, were now metamorphos'd into _philosophical Forms_ and
_Phantoms;_ and, like Flags and Banners, display'd in hostile manner, and borne
_offensively,_ by one Party against another. In former times those barbarous
Nations above mention'd were the sole Warriors in these religious Causes; but
now the whole World became engag'd: when instead of _Storks_ and _Crocodiles,_
other Ensigns were erected; when _sophistical Chimeras, crabbed Notions,
bombastick Phrases, Solecisms, Absurditys,_ and a thousand Monsters of a
_scholastick_ Brood, were set on foot, and made the Subject of vulgar Animosity
and Dispute.

{#25} Here first began that Spirit of _Bigotry,_ which broke out in a more
raging manner than had been ever known before, and was less capable of _Temper_
or _Moderation_ than any Species, Form, or Mixture of Religion in the antient
World. _Mysterys,_ which were heretofore treated with profound respect, and lay
unexpos'd to vulgar Eyes, became publick and prostitute; being enforc'd with
Terrors, and urg'd with Compulsion and Violence, on the unfitted Capacitys and
Apprehensions of Mankind. The very _Jewish_ Traditions, and _Cabalistick_
Learning underwent this Fate. That which was naturally the Subject of profound
Speculation and Inquiry, was made the necessary Subject of a strict and absolute
Assent. The _allegorical, mythological_ Account of Sacred Things, was wholly
inverted: Liberty of Judgment and Exposition taken away: No Ground left for
Inquiry, Search, or Meditation: No Refuge from the _dogmatical_ Spirit let
loose. Every Quarter was taken up; every Portion prepossess'd. All was reduc'd
to[n30] _Article_ and _Proposition._

{#26} Thus a sort of _philosophical_ ^Enthusiasm^ overspread the World. And
^Bigotry^ (a[n31] Species of _Superstition_ hardly known before) took place in
Mens Affections, and arm'd 'em with a new Jealousy against each other. Barbarous
Terms and Idioms were every day introduc'd: Monstrous Definitions invented and
impos'd: New Schemes of Faith erected from time to time; and Hostilitys, the
fiercest imaginable, exercis'd on these occasions. So that the ^Enthusiasm^ or
^Zeal,^ which was usually shewn by Mankind in behalf of their particular
Worships, and which for the most part had been hitherto _defensive_ only, grew
now to be universally of the _offensive_ kind.

{#27} IT MAY be expected of me perhaps, that being fallen thus from remote
Antiquity to later Periods, I shou'd speak on this occasion with more than
ordinary Exactness and Regularity. It may be urg'd against me, that I talk here,
as _at random,_ and _without-book:_ neglecting to produce my Authoritys, or
continue my Quotations, according to the profess'd Style and Manner in which I
began this present Chapter. But as there are many greater Privileges by way of
Variation, Interruption, and Digression, allow'd to us _Writers of_
^Miscellany;^ and especially to such as are _Commentators_ upon other Authors; I
shall be content to remain mysterious in this respect, and explain my-self no
further than by a noted _Story;_ which seems to sute our Author's purpose, and
the present Argument.

{#28} 'Tis observable from Holy Writ, that the antient ^Ephesian^ Worshipers,
however zealous or enthusiastick they appear'd, had only _a defensive_ kind of
Zeal in behalf of their[n32] Temple; whenever they thought in earnest, it was
brought in danger. In the[n33] Tumult which happen'd in that City near the time
of the holy Apostle's Retreat, we have a remarkable instance of what our Author
calls a religious _Panick._ As little _Bigots_ as the People were, and as far
from any _offensive_ Zeal, yet when their establish'd Church came to be call'd
in question, we see in what a manner their Zeal began to operate.[n34] "_All
with one voice, about the space of two hours, cried out, saying, Great is_
^Diana^ _of the_ Ephesians." At the same time this Assembly was so confus'd,
that[n35] _the greater part knew not wherefore they were come together;_ and
consequently cou'd not understand why their Church was _in any Danger._ But the
^Enthusiasm^ was got up, and a ^Panick^ _Fear for the Church_ had struck the
Multitude. It ran into a popular _Rage_ or epidemical _Phrenzy,_ and was
communicated (as our[n36] Author expresses it) "by Aspect, or, as it were, by
Contact, or Sympathy."

{#29} It must be confess'd, that there was, besides these Motives, _a secret
Spring_ which forwarded this ^Enthusiasm.^ For certain Partys concern'd, Men of
Craft, and strictly united in Interest, had been secretly call'd together, and
told, "Gentlemen![n37] (or _Sirs!_) Ye know that by this _Mystery,_ or Craft, we
have our Wealth. Ye see withal, and have heard, that not only here at ^Ephesus,^
but almost thro'out all ^Asia,^ this ^Paul^ has persuaded and turn'd away many
People, by telling them, _They are no real Gods who are figur'd, or wrought with
hands:_ so that not only this our _Craft_ is in danger; but also _the Temple_
it-self."

{#30} Nothing cou'd be more _moderate_ and wise, nothing more agreeable to that
magisterial Science or Policy, which our Author[n38] recommends, than the
Behaviour of the _Town-Clerk_ or _Recorder_ of the City, as he is represented on
this occasion, in Holy Writ. I must confess indeed, he went pretty far in the
use of this moderating Art. He ventur'd to assure the People, "That every one
acquiesc'd in their antient Worship of the great Goddess, and in their Tradition
of the Image, which fell down from ^Jupiter:^ That these were Facts undeniable:
and That the new Sect neither meant the pulling down of their Church, nor so
much as offer'd to blaspheme or speak amiss of their Goddess."

{#31} This, no doubt, was stretching the point sufficiently; as may be
understood by the Event, in after time. One might perhaps have suspected this
Recorder to have been himself _a Dissenter,_ or at least _an Occasional
Conformist,_ who cou'd answer so roundly for the new Sect, and warrant the
_Church in Being_ secure of Damage, and out of all _Danger_ for the future. Mean
while the Tumult was appeas'd: No harm befel the Temple for that time. The new
Sect acquiesc'd in what had been spoken on their behalf. They allow'd the
Apology of the Recorder. Accordingly the Zeal of the Heathen Church, which was
only _defensive,_ gave way: And the new Religionists were prosecuted no further.

{#32} Hitherto, it seems, the Face of ^Persecution^ had not openly shewn it-self
in the wide World. 'Twas sufficient Security for every Man, that he gave no
disturbance to what was publickly establish'd. But when _offensive Zeal_ came to
be discover'd in one Party, the rest became in a manner necessitated to be
Aggressors in their turn. They who observ'd, or had once experienc'd this
intolerating Spirit, cou'd no longer tolerate on their part.[n39] And they who
had once exerted it over others, cou'd expect no better Quarter for themselves.
So that nothing less than _mutual Extirpation_ became the Aim, and almost open
Profession of each religious Society.

{#33} In this extremity, it might well perhaps have been esteem'd the happiest
Wish for Mankind, That _one_ of these contending Partys of incompatible
Religionists shou'd at last prevail over the rest; so as by an universal and
absolute Power to[n40] determine Orthodoxy, and make that Opinion effectually
_Catholick,_ which in their particular Judgment had the best right to that
Denomination. And thus by force of Massacre and Desolation, _Peace_ in Worship,
and _Civil_ Unity by help of the _Spiritual,_ might be presum'd in a fair way of
being restor'd to Mankind.

{#34} I shall conclude with observing how ably the ^Roman^ -_Christian,_ and
once _Catholick_ Church, by the assistance of their converted[n41] Emperors,
proceeded in the Establishment of their growing Hierarchy. They consider'd
wisely the various _Superstitions_ and _Enthusiasms_ of Mankind; and prov'd the
different Kinds and Force of each. All these seeming Contrarietys of human
Passion they knew how to comprehend in their political Model and subservient
System of Divinity. They knew how to make advantage both from the high
Speculations of _Philosophy,_ and _the grossest Ideas_ of vulgar _Ignorance._
They saw there was nothing more different than _that_ ^Enthusiasm^ which ran
upon _Spirituals,_ according to the[n42] simpler Views of the divine Existence,
and _that_ which ran upon[n43] external Proportions, Magnificence of Structures,
Ceremonys, Processions, Quires, and those other Harmonys which captivate _the
Eye_ and _Ear._ On this account they even added to this _latter_ kind, and
display'd Religion in a yet more gorgeous Habit of Temples, Statues, Paintings,
Vestments, Copes, Miters, Purple, and the Cathedral Pomp. With these Arms they
cou'd subdue the victorious _Goths,_ and secure themselves an ^Attila,^[n44]
when their ^Caesars^ fail'd them.

{#35} The truth is, 'tis but a vulgar Species of ^Enthusiasm,^ which is mov'd
chiefly by _Shew_ and _Ceremony,_ and wrought upon by Chalices and Candles,
Robes, and figur'd Dances. Yet this, we may believe, was lookt upon as no slight
Ingredient of _Devotion_ in those Days; since, at this hour, the Manner is found
to be of considerable Efficacy with some of the Devout amongst our-selves, who
pass the least for _superstitious,_ and are reckon'd in the Number of the polite
World. This the wise Hierarchy duly preponderating; but being satisfy'd withal
that there were other Tempers and Hearts which cou'd not so easily be captivated
by this _exterior_ Allurement, they assign'd another Part of Religion to
Proselytes of another _Character_ and _Complexion,_ who were allow'd to proceed
on a quite different bottom; by _the inward way_ of _Contemplation,_ and _Divine
Love._

{#36} They are indeed so far from being jealous of mere ^Enthusiasm,^ or the
_extatick_ manner of Devotion, that they allow their _Mysticks_ to write and
preach in the most rapturous and seraphick Strains. They suffer them, in a
manner, to supersede all external Worship, and triumph over outward Forms; till
the refin'd Religionists proceed so far as either expresly or seemingly to
dissuade the Practice of the vulgar and establish'd Ceremonial Dutys. And then,
indeed,[n45] they check the suppos'd _exorbitant_ ^Enthusiasm,^ which wou'd
prove dangerous to their _Hierarchal_ State.

{#37} If modern _Visions, Prophecys,_ and _Dreams, Charms, Miracles, Exorcisms,_
and the rest of this kind, be comprehended in that which we call ^Fanaticism^ or
^Superstition;^ to this Spirit they allow a full Career; whilst to ingenuous
Writers they afford the Liberty, on the other side, in a civil manner, to call
in question these spiritual Feats perform'd in Monasterys, or up and down by
their _mendicant_ or _itinerant_ Priests, and ghostly Missionarys.

{#38} This is that antient _Hierarchy,_ which in respect of its first
Foundation, its Policy, and the Consistency of its whole Frame and Constitution,
cannot but appear in some respect august and venerable, even in such as we do
not usually esteem weak Eyes. These are the spiritual Conquerors, who, like the
first ^Caesars,^ from small Beginnings, establish'd the Foundations of an almost
Universal Monarchy. No wonder if at this day the immediate View of this
Hierarchal Residence, the _City_ and _Court_ of ^Rome,^ be found to have an
extraordinary Effect on Foreigners of other latter Churches. No wonder if the
amaz'd Surveyors are for the future so apt either to conceive the horridest
Aversion to all Priestly Government; or, on the contrary, to admire it, so far
as even to wish a Coalescence or Re-union with this antient _Mother_-Church.

{#39} In reality, the Exercise of Power, however arbitrary or despotick, seems
less intolerable under such a spiritual Sovereignty, so extensive, antient, and
of such a long Succession, than under the petty Tyrannys and mimical Politys of
some new Pretenders. The former may even[n46] _persecute_ with a tolerable
Grace: The latter, who wou'd willingly derive their Authority from the former,
and graft on their _successive Right,_ must necessarily make a very aukard
Figure. And whilst they strive to give themselves the same Air of Independency
on the Civil Magistrate; whilst they affect the same Authority in Government,
the same Grandure, Magnificence, and Pomp in Worship, they raise the highest
Ridicule, in the Eyes of those who have real Discernment, and can distinguish
_Originals_ from _Copys:_

{#n3} The good Doctor makes use, here, of a Stroke of Raillery against the
over-frighted _anti-superstitious_ Gentlemen, with whom our Author reasons at
large in his second Treatise (_viz._ VOL. I. _pag._ 85, 86, _&c._ and 88,
89, _&c._). 'Tis indeed the Nature of _Fear,_ as of all other Passions, when
excessive, to defeat its own End, and prevent us in the execution of what we
naturally propose to our-selves as our Advantage. ^Superstition^ it-self is but
a certain kind of _Fear,_ which possessing us strongly with the apprehended
Wrath or Displeasure of _Divine Powers,_ hinders us from judging what those
_Powers_ are in themselves, or what Conduct of ours may, with best reason, be
thought sutable to such highly rational and superior Natures. Now if from the
Experience of many gross Delusions of a superstitious kind, the Course of this
Fear begins to turn; 'tis natural for it to run, with equal violence, a contrary
way. The extreme Passion for religious Objects passes into an Aversion. And a
certain _Horror_ and _Dread of Imposture_ causes as great a Disturbance as even
_Imposture it-self_ had done before. In such a Situation as this, the Mind may
easily be blinded; as well in one respect, as in the other. 'Tis plain, _both_
these Disorders carry something with them which discover us to be in some manner
beside our Reason, and out of the right use of Judgment and Understanding. For
how can we be said to _intrust_ or _use_ our Reason, if in any case we fear to
be convinc'd? How are we Masters of our-selves, when we have acquir'd the Habit
of bringing Horror, Aversion, Favour, Fondness, or any other Temper than that of
mere _Indifference_ and _Impartiality,_ into the Judgment of Opinions, and
Search of Truth?

{#n6} It appears from hence, that in the Notion which this learned Divine gives
us of ^Enthusiasm,^ he comprehends the _social_ or _popular_ Genius of the
Passion; agreeably with what our Author in his Letter concerning _Enthusiasm_
(_p._ 15, 16, 44, 45.) has said of the Influence and Power of the _Assembly_ and
_Auditory_ it-self, and of the communicative Force and rapid Progress of this

{#n27} How rich and vast these were, especially in the latter times of that
Empire, may be judg'd from what belong'd to the single Order of _the Vestals,_
and what we read of the Revenues belonging to the Temples of _the Sun,_ (as in
the time of the Monster ^Heliogabalus^ ) and of other Donations by other
Emperors. But what may give us yet a greater Idea of these Riches, is, That in
the latter Heathen Times, which grew more and more superstitious, the
restraining Laws (or Statues of _Mort-main_) by which Men had formerly been
with-held from giving away Estates by _Will,_ or otherwise, _to Religious Uses,_
were repeal'd; and the Heathen-Church left, in this manner, as a bottomless
Gulph and devouring Receptacle of Land and Treasure. _Senatûs-consulto, &
Constitutionibus Principum, Haeredes instituere concessum est Apollinem
Didymaeum, Dianam Ephesiam, Matrem Deorum,_ &c. [By decree of the Senate and
by the imperial orders of the Emperor it is granted to establish as heirs
Didymean Apollo, Ephesian Diana, mother of the gods, etc.]This answers not amiss
to the modern Practice and Expression of _Making our Soul our Heir:_ Giving to
_God_ what has been taken sometimes with freedom enough from _Man;_ and
conveying Estates in such a manner in this World, as to make good Interest of
them in another. The Reproach of the antient _Satirist_ is at present out of
doors. 'Tis no affront to Religion now-a-days to compute its Profits. And a Man
might well be accounted dull, who, in our present Age, shou'd ask the Question,
_Dicite, Pontifices, in sacro quid facit Aurum?_ Pers. Sat. ii. ver. 69.

{#n31} Let any one who considers distinctly the Meaning and Force of the word
BIGOTRY, endeavour to render it in either of the antient Languages, and he will
find how peculiar a Passion it implies; and how different from the mere
Affection of _Enthusiasm_ or _Superstition._

{#n32} The Magnificence and Beauty of that Temple is well known to all who have
form'd any Idea of the antient _Grecian_ Arts and Workmanship. It seems to me to
be remarkable in our learned and elegant Apostle, that tho an Enemy to this
mechanical Spirit of Religion in the ^Ephesians;^ yet according to his known
Character, he accommodates himself to their Humour, and the natural Turn of
their ^Enthusiasm;^ by writing to his Converts in a kind of _Architect_-Style,
and almost with a perpetual Allusion to _Building,_ and to that _Majesty,
Order,_ and _Beauty,_ of which their Temple was a Master-piece. ἐποικοδομηθέντες

{#n39} Thus the Controversy stood before the Time of the Emperor ^Julian^, when
Blood had been so freely drawn, and Crueltys so frequently exchang'd not only
between Christian and Heathen, but between Christian and Christian; after the
most barbarous manner. What the Zeal was of many early Christians against the
Idolatry of the old Heathen Church (at that time the establish'd one) may be
comprehended by any Person who is ever so slenderly vers'd in the History of
those Times. Nor can it be said indeed of us Moderns, that in the quality of
_good Christians_ (as that Character is generally understood) we are found
either backward or scrupulous in assigning to Perdition such Wretches as we
pronounce _guilty of Idolatry_. The name _Idolater_ is sufficient Excuse for
almost any kind of Insult against the Person, and much more against the Worship
of such a Mis-Believer. The very word _Christian_ is in common Language us'd for
_Man_, in opposition to _Brute-Beast_, without leaving so much as a middle place
for the poor _Heathen_ or _Pagan_: who, as the greater Beast of the two, is
naturally doom'd to Massacre, and his Gods and Temples to Fracture and
Demolishment. Nor are we masters of this Passion, even in our best humour. The
_French_ Poets, we see, can with great Success, and general Applause, exhibit
this primitive Zeal even on the publick Stage: [^Polyeucte^, Act II. Sc. 6.]
    ""$Ne perdons plus de temps, le Sacrifice est prêt. //
    Allons y du vray Dieu soutenir l'intérêt, //
    Allons fouler aux piés ce Foudre ridicule //
    Dont arme un bois pourri ce Peuple trop credule; //
    Allons en éclairer l'aveuglement fatal, //
    Allons briser ces Dieux de Pierre & de Metau: //
    Abandonnons nos jours à cette ardeur celeste, //
    Faisons triompher Dieu; qu'il dispose du reste.$""
I shou'd scarce have mention'd this, but that it came into my mind how ill a
Construction some People have endeavour'd to make of what our Author, stating
the Case of Heathen and Christian Persecution, in his _Letter of Enthusiasm_,
has said concerning the Emperor ^Julian^. It was no more indeed than had been
said of that virtuous and gallant Emperor by his greatest Enemys; even by those
who, to the shame of Christianity, boasted of his having been most insolently
affronted on all occasions, and even treacherously assassinated by one of his
Christian Soldiers. As for such Authors as these, shou'd I cite them in their
proper invective Style and Saint-like Phrase, they wou'd make no very agreeable
appearance, especially in _Miscellanys_ of the kind we have here undertaken. But
a Letter of that elegant and witty Emperor, may not be improperly plac'd amongst
our Citations, as a Pattern of his Humour and Genius, as well as of his
Principle and Sentiments, on this occasion. [^Julian^'s _Epistles_, Numb. 52.]
    ""^Julian^ to the ^Bostrens^. //
    "_I should have thought, indeed, that the _Galilaean_ Leaders wou'd have
    esteem'd themselves more indebted to me, than to him who preceded me in the
    Administration of the Empire. For in his time, many of them suffer'd Exile,
    Persecution, and Imprisonment. Multitudes of those whom in their Religion
    they term _Hereticks_, were put to the sword. Insomuch that in _Samosata_,
    _Cyzicum_, _Paphlagonia_, _Bithynia_, _Galatia_, and many other Countrys,
    whole Towns were level'd with the Earth. The just Reverse of this has been
    observ'd in my time. The Exiles have been recall'd; and the Proscrib'd
    restor'd to the lawful Possession of their Estates. But to that height of
    Fury and Distraction are this People arriv'd, that being no longer allow'd
    the Privilege to tyrannize over one another, or persecute either their own
    Sectarys, or the Religious of the lawful Church, they swell with rage, and
    leave no stone unturn'd, no opportunity unimploy'd, of raising Tumult and
    Sedition. So little regard have they to true Piety; so little Obedience to
    our Laws and Constitutions; however humane and tolerating. For still do we
    determine and steddily resolve, never to suffer one of them to be drawn
    involuntarily to our Altars. \* \* \* As for the mere People, indeed, they
    appear driven to these Riots and Seditions by those amongst them whom they
    call CLERICKS: who are now enrag'd to find themselves restrain'd in the use
    of their former Power and intemperate Rule. \* \* \* They can no longer act
    the Magistrate or Civil Judg, nor assume Authority to make Peoples _Wills_,
    supplant Relations, possess themselves of other Mens Patrimonys, and by
    specious Pretences transfer _all_ into their own possession. \* \* \* For
    this reason I have thought fit, by this _Publick EDICT_, to forewarn the
    People of this sort, that they raise no more Commotions, nor gather in a
    riotous manner about their seditious CLERICKS, in defiance of the
    Magistrate, who has been insulted and in danger of being ston'd by these
    incited Rabbles. In their Congregations they may, notwithstanding, assemble
    as they please, and croud about their Leaders, performing Worship, receiving
    Doctrine, and praying, according as they are by them taught and conducted:
    But if with any Tendency to Sedition; let them beware how they hearken, or
    give assent; and remember, 'tis at their peril, if by these means they are
    secretly wrought up to Mutiny and Insurrection. \* \* \* Live, therefore, in
    Peace and Quietness! neither spitefully opposing, or injuriously treating
    one another. You misguided People of the new way, Beware, on your side! And
    you of the antient and establish'd Church, injure not your Neighbours and
    Fellow-Citizens, who are enthusiastically led away, in Ignorance and
    Mistake, rather than with Design or Malice! 'Tis by DISCOURSE and REASON,
    not by _Blows_, _Insults_, or _Violence_, that Men are to be inform'd of
    Truth, and convinc'd of Error. Again therefore and again I enjoin and charge
    the zealous Followers of the true Religion, no way to injure, molest, or
    affront the _Galilaean_ People._"""
Thus the generous and mild Emperor; whom we may indeed call _Heathen_, but not
so justly _Apostate_: since being, at different times of his Youth, transfer'd
to different Schools or Universitys, and bred under Tutors of each Religion, as
well _Heathen_ as _Christian_; he happen'd, when of full age, to make his choice
(tho very unfortunately) in the former kind, and adher'd to the antient Religion
of his Country and Forefathers. See the same Emperor's [Letters to ^Artabius^,
Numb. 7.] and [to ^Hecebolus^, Numb. 43.] and [to the People of _Alexandria_,
Numb. 10.] See VOL. I. _pag._ 25.

{#n44} When this victorious Ravager was in full March to ^Rome,^ St. ^Leo^ (the
then Pope) went out to meet him in solemn Pomp. The _Goth_ was struck with the
Appearance, obey'd the Priest, and retir'd instantly with his whole Army in a
_panick_ Fear; alledging that among the rest of the _Pontifical_ Train, he had
seen one of an extraordinary Form, who threaten'd him with Death, if he did not
instantly retire. Of this important Encounter there are in St. ^Peter'^ s
Church, in the _Vatican,_ and elsewhere, at ^Rome,^ many fine Sculptures,
Paintings, and Representations, deservingly made, in honour of the Miracle.
