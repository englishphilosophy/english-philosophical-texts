{#1} AS resolute as our Author may have shewn himself in refusing to take notice
of the smart Writings publish'd against him by certain _Zealots_ of his _own_
Country, he cou'd not, it seems, but out of curiosity observe what the _foreign_
and more _impartial Criticks_ might object to his small Treatise, which he was
surpriz'd to hear had been translated into foreign Languages, soon after it had
been publish'd here at home. The first Censure of this kind which came to our
Author's sight, was that of the ^Paris^[n1] _Journal des Savans._ Considering
how little favourable the Author of the Letter had shewn himself towards the
_Romish_ Church, and Policy of ^France,^ it must be own'd those Journalists have
treated him with sufficient Candor: tho they fail'd not to take what Advantages
they well cou'd against the Writing, and particularly arraign'd it for the
want[n2] of Order and Method.

{#2} The Protestant Writers, such as live in a free Country, and can deliver
their Sentiments without Constraint, have certainly[n3] done our Author more
Honour than he ever presum'd to think he cou'd deserve. His _Translator_ indeed,
who had done him the previous Honour of introducing him to the Acquaintance of
the foreign World, represents particularly, by the Turn given to the latter end
of the Letter, that the Writer of it was, as to his Condition and Rank, little
better than an inferior Dependent on the noble Lord to whom he had address'd
himself. And in reality the _Original_ has so much of that air; that I wonder
not, if what the Author left ambiguous, the Translator has determin'd to the
side of _Clientship_ and _Dependency._

{#3} But whatever may have been the Circumstance or Character of our Author
himself; that of his _great_ Friend ought in justice to have been consider'd by
those former Criticks above-mention'd. So much, at least, shou'd have been taken
notice of, that there was _a real_ ^greatMan^ characteriz'd, and sutable
Measures of Address and Style preserv'd. But they who wou'd neither observe
this, nor apprehend the Letter it-self to be _real,_ were insufficient Criticks,
and unqualify'd to judg of the Turn or Humour of a Piece, which they had never
consider'd in a proper light.

{#4} 'Tis become indeed so common a Practice among Authors, to feign a
Correspondency, and give the Title of _a private Letter_ to a Piece address'd
solely to the _Publick,_ that it wou'd not be strange to see other _Journalists_
and _Criticks,_ as well as the Gentlemen of ^Paris,^ pass over such
Particularitys, as things of Form. This Prejudice however cou'd not misguide a
chief Critick of the Protestant side; when[n4] mentioning this _Letter
concerning Enthusiasm,_ he speaks of it as a real _Letter,_ (such as in truth it
was) not a precise and formal[n5] ^Treatise,^ design'd for _publick_ View.

{#5} It will be own'd surely, by those who have learnt to judg of Elegancy and
Wit by the help merely of modern Languages, That we cou'd have little Relish of
the best _Letters_ of a ^Balsac^ or ^Voiture,^ were we wholly ignorant of the
_Characters_ of the principal Persons to whom those _Letters_ were actually
written. But much less cou'd we find pleasure in this reading, shou'd we take it
into our heads, that both the Personages and Correspondency it-self were merely
fictitious. Let the best of ^Tully'^ s Epistles be read in such a narrow View as
this, and they will certainly prove very insipid. If a real ^Brutus,^ a real
^Atticus^ be not suppos'd, there will be no real ^Cicero.^ The elegant Writer
will disappear: as will the vast Labour and Art with which this eloquent _Roman_
writ those Letters to his illustrious Friends. There was no kind of Composition
in which this great Author prided or pleas'd himself more than in this; where he
endeavour'd to throw off the Mein of _the Philosopher_ and _Orator,_ whilst in
effect he employ'd both his Rhetorick and Philosophy with the greatest Force.
They who can read an _Epistle_ or _Satir_ of ^Horace^ in somewhat better than a
mere scholastick Relish, will comprehend that _the Concealment of Order_ and
_Method,_ in this manner of Writing, makes the chief Beauty of the Work. They
will own, that unless a Reader be in some measure appriz'd of the Characters of
an ^Augustus,^ a ^Maecenas,^ a ^Florus,^ or a ^Trebatius,^ there will be little
Relish in those _Satirs_ or _Epistles_ address'd in particular to the Courtiers,
Ministers, and Great Men of the Times. Even the ^Satirick,^ or ^Miscellaneous^
_Manner_ of the polite Antients, requir'd as much _Order_ as the most regular
Pieces. But the _Art_ was to destroy every such Token or Appearance, give an
_extemporary_ Air to what was writ, and make the _Effect_ of Art be felt,
without discovering the _Artifice._ There needs no further Explanation on this
Head. Our Author himself has said enough in his[n6] _Advice to an Author,_
particularly where he treats of the _simple_ Style, in contra-distinction to the
_learned,_ the _formal,_ or _methodick._

{#6} 'Tis a different Case indeed, when the Title of _Epistle_ is improperly
given to such Works as were never writ in any other view than that of being made
publick, or to serve as Exercises or Specimens of the Wit of their Composer.
Such were those infinite Numbers of _Greek_ and _Latin_ Epistles, writ by the
antient _Sophists, Grammarians,_ or _Rhetoricians;_ where we find the real
Character of _the Epistle,_ the genuine Style and Manners of the corresponding
Partys sometimes imitated; but at other times not so much as aim'd at, nor any
Measures of _historical Truth_ preserv'd. Such perhaps we may esteem even the
Letters of a[n7] ^Seneca^ to his Friend ^Lucilius.^ Or supposing that
philosophical Courtier had really such a Correspondency; and, at several times,
had sent so many fair Epistles, honestly sign'd and seal'd, to his
Country-friend at a distance; it appears however by the Epistles themselves, in
their proper _Order,_ (if they may be said to have any) that after a few
Attempts at the beginning, the Author by degrees loses sight of his
Correspondent, and takes the _World_ in general for his Reader or Disciple. He
falls into the random way of _Miscellaneous_ Writing; says every-where great and
noble Things, in and out of the way, accidentally as _Words_ led him (for with
these he plays perpetually); with infinite Wit, but with little or no Coherence;
without a Shape or Body to his Work; without a real[n8] _Beginning,_ a _Middle,_
or an _End._ Of _a hundred and twenty four_ Epistles, you may, if you please,
make _five Hundred,_ or _half a Score._ A great-one, for instance, you may
divide into _five_ or _six._ A little-one you may tack to another; and that to
another; and so on. The Unity of the Writing will be the same: The Life and
Spirit full as well preserv'd. 'Tis not only _whole Letters_ or _Pages_ you may
change and manage thus at pleasure: Every _Period,_ every _Sentence_ almost, is
independent; and may be taken asunder, transpos'd, postpon'd, anticipated, or
set in any new Order, as you fansy.

{#7} This is the Manner of Writing so much admir'd and imitated in our Age, that
we have scarce the Idea of any other Model. We know little, indeed, of the
Difference between one _Model_ or _Character_ of writing and another. All runs
to the same Tune, and beats exactly one and the same Measure. Nothing, one wou'd
think, cou'd be more tedious than this uniform _Pace._ The common _Amble_ or
_Canterbury_ is not, I am persuaded, more tiresom to a good Rider, than this
_see-saw_ of ^Essay^ -_Writers_ is to an able Reader. The just Composer of a
legitimate Piece is like an able Traveller, who exactly measures his Journey,
considers his Ground, premeditates his Stages, and Intervals of Relaxation and
Intention, to the very Conclusion of his Undertaking, that he happily arrives
where he first propos'd when he set out. He is not presently _upon the Spur,_ or
in his full _Career;_ but walks his Steed _leisurely_ out of his Stable, settles
himself in his Stirrups, and when fair Road and Season offer, puts on perhaps to
_a round Trot;_ thence into _a Gallop,_ and after a while _takes up._ As Down,
or Meadow, or shady Lane present themselves, he accordingly sutes his Pace,
favours his Palfry; and is sure not to bring him puffing, and in a heat, into
his last Inn. But the _Post_-way is become highly fashionable with modern
Authors. The very same stroke sets you out, and brings you in. Nothing stays, or
interrupts. Hill or Valley; rough or smooth; thick or thin: No Difference; no
Variation. When _an Author_ sits down to write, he knows no other Business he
has, than to be _witty,_ and take care that his Periods be well turn'd, or (as
they commonly say) _run smooth._ In this manner, he doubts not to gain the
Character of _bright._ When he has writ as many Pages as he likes, or as his Run
of Fancy wou'd permit; he then perhaps considers what _Name_ he had best give to
his new Writing: whether he shou'd call it _Letter, Essay, Miscellany,_ or aught
else. The Bookseller perhaps is to determine this at last, when all, besides the
Preface, Epistle Dedicatory, and Title-page, is dispatch'd.

{#n7} †'Tis not the _Person, Character,_ or _Genius,_ but the _Style_ and
_Manner_ of this great Man, which we presume to censure. We acknowledg his noble
Sentiments and worthy Actions. We own _the Patriot,_ and _good Minister:_ But we
reject _the Writer._ He was the first of any Note or Worth who gave credit to
that _false_ Style and Manner here spoken of. He might, on this account, be
call'd in reality _The Corrupter of_ ^Roman^ _Eloquence._ This indeed cou'd not
but naturally, and of it-self, become relax and dissolute, after such a
Relaxation and Dissolution of Manners, consequent to the Change of Government,
and to the horrid Luxury and Effeminacy of the _Roman_ Court, even before the
time of a ^Claudius,^ or a ^Nero.^ There was no more possibility of making a
Stand for Language, than for Liberty. As the World now stood, the highest Glory
which cou'd be attain'd by mortal Man, was to be Mitigator or Moderator of that
universal Tyranny already establish'd. To this I must add, That in every City,
Principality, or smaller Nation, where _single_ WILL prevails, and Court-power,
instead of Laws or Constitutions, guides the State; 'tis of the highest
difficulty for the best Minister to procure a just, or even a tolerable
Administration. Where such a Minister is found, who can but moderately influence
the petty Tyranny, he deserves considerable Applause and Honour. But in the Case
we have mention'd, where a universal Monarchy was actually establish'd, and the
Interest of a whole World concern'd; _He_ surely must have been esteem'd a
Guardian-Angel, who, as _a prime Minister,_ cou'd, for several Years, turn the
very worst of Courts, and worst-condition'd of all Princes, to the fatherly Care
and just Government of Mankind. Such a _Minister_ was ^Seneca^ under an
^Agrippina^ and a ^Nero.^ And such he was acknowledg'd by the antient and
never-sparing _Satirists,_ who cou'd not forbear to celebrate, withal, his
_Generosity_ and _Friendship_ in a private Life:
    ""$Nemo petit, modicis quae mittebantur amicis //
    A ^Seneca;^ quae ^Piso^ bonus, quae ^Cotta^ solebat //
    Largiri: namque & titulis, & fascibus olim //
    Major habebatur donandi gloria.$ //
    [Juvenal. Sat. v. ver. 108.]""
    ""$——Quis tam //Perditus, ut dubitet ^Senecam^ praeferre ^Neroni?^$//
    [Id. Sat. viii. ver. 211.]""
This Remark is what I have been tempted to make by the way, on the _Character_
of this _Roman_ Author, more mistaken (if I am not very much so my-self) than
any other so generally study'd. As for the _philosophick_ Character or Function
imputed to him, 'twas foreign, and no-way proper or peculiar to one who never
assum'd so much as that of _Sophist,_ or _Pensionary Teacher of Philosophy._ He
was far wide of any such Order, or Profession. There is great difference between
a Courtier who takes a Fancy for Philosophy, and a Philosopher who shou'd take a
Fancy for a Court. Now ^Seneca^ was born _a Courtier;_ being Son of a
Court-_Rhetor:_ himself bred in the same manner, and taken into favour for his
Wit and Genius, his admir'd Style and Eloquence; not for his Learning in the
Books of Philosophy and the Antients. For this indeed was not very profound in
him. In short, he was a Man of wonderful Wit, Fluency of Thought and Language,
an _able Minister,_ and _honest Courtier._ And what has been deliver'd down to
his prejudice, is by the common Enemy of all the free and generous ^Romans,^
that apish shallow Historian, and Court-Flatterer, ^Dion Cassius,^ of a low Age,
when _Barbarism_ (as may be easily seen in his own Work) came on apace, and the
very Traces and Features of Virtue, Science and Knowledg, were wearing out of
the World.
