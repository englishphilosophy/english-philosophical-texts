{#1} AMONG the many Improvements daily made in the Art of Writing, there is none
perhaps which can be said to have attain'd a greater Height than that of
_Controversy,_ or the Method of _Answer_ and _Refutation._ 'Tis true indeed,
that antiently the Wits of Men were for the most part taken up in other
Employment. If Authors writ _ill,_ they were despis'd: If _well,_ they were by
some Party or other espous'd. For _Partys_ there wou'd necessarily be, and
_Sects_ of every kind, in Learning and Philosophy. Every one sided with whom he
lik'd; and having the liberty of hearing _each_ side speak for it-self, stood in
no need of express _Warning-Pieces_ against pretended Sophistry, or dangerous
Reasoning. Particular _Answers_ to single Treatises, were thought to be of
little use. And it was esteem'd no Compliment to a Reader, to help him so
carefully in the Judgment of every Piece which came abroad. Whatever _Sects_
there were in those days, the Zeal of _Party_-causes ran not so high as to give
the Reader a Taste of those _personal_ Reproaches, which might pass in a Debate
between the different _Partymen._

{#2} Thus Matters stood of old; when as yet the Method of writing _Controversy_
was not rais'd into an _Art,_ nor the Feuds of contending Authors become the
chief Amusement of the learned World. But we have at present so high a Relish of
this kind, that the Writings of the Learned are never truly gustful till they
are come to what we may properly enough call _their due Ripeness,_ and have
begot a _Fray._ When the _Answer_ and _Reply_ is once form'd, our Curiosity is
excited: We begin then, for the first time, to whet our Attention, and apply our
Ear.

{#3} For example: Let a zealous _Divine_ and flaming Champion of our Faith, when
inclin'd to shew himself in Print, make choice of some tremendous _Mystery_ of
Religion, oppos'd heretofore by some damnable _Heresiarch;_ whom having
vehemently refuted, he turns himself towards the orthodox Opinion, and supports
the true Belief, with the highest Eloquence and profoundest Erudition; he shall,
notwithstanding this, remain perhaps in deep Obscurity, to the great affliction
of his Bookseller, and the regret of all who bear a just Veneration for
_Church-history,_ and the antient Purity of the _Christian_ Faith. But let it so
happen that in this Prosecution of his deceas'd Adversary, our _Doctor_ raises
up some _living Antagonist;_ who, on the same foot of Orthodoxy with himself,
pretends to arraign his Expositions, and refute the Refuter upon every Article
he has advanc'd; from this moment the Writing gathers Life, the Publick listens,
the Bookseller takes heart; and when Issue is well join'd, the Repartees grown
smart, and the Contention vigorous between the learned Partys, _a Ring_ is made,
and _Readers_ gather in abundance. Every one _takes party,_ and encourages his
_own_ Side. "This shall be my Champion!—This Man for my Money!—Well hit, on our
side!—Again, a good Stroke!—There he was even with him!—Have at him the next
Bout!"—Excellent Sport! And when the _Combatants_ are for a-while drawn off, and
each retir'd with his own Companions; What _Praises,_ and _Congratulations!_
What _Applauses_ of the suppos'd _Victor!_ And how honourably is he saluted by
his Favourers, and complimented even to the disturbance of his Modesty! "Nay,
but Gentlemen!—Good Gentlemen! Do you really think thus?—Are you sincere with
me?—Have I treated my Adversary as he deserves?" "Never was Man so maul'd. Why
you have kill'd him downright." "O, Sirs! you flatter me." "He can never rise
more." "Think ye so indeed?" "Or if he shou'd; 'twou'd be a Pleasure to see how
you wou'd handle him."

{#4} These are the Triumphs. This what sets _sharp:_ This gives the Author his
_Edge,_ and excites the Reader's Attention; when the Trumpets are thus sounded
to the Croud, and a kind of _Amphitheatrical_ Entertainment exhibited to the
Multitude, by these _Gladiatorian_ Pen-men.

{#5} The Author of the preceding Treatises being by profession a nice
_Inspector_ into _the Ridicule_ of Things, must in all probability have rais'd
to himself some such Views as these, which hinder'd him from engaging in the way
of _Controversy._ For when, by accident, the[n1] First of these Treatises (_a
private Letter,_ and in the Writer's Esteem, little worthy of the Publick's
notice) came to be read abroad in Copys, and afterwards in Print; the smartest
_Answers_ which came out against it, cou'd not, it seems, move our Author to
form any _Reply._ All he was heard to say in return, was, "That he thought
whoever had taken upon him to publish a Book in answer to that casual Piece, had
certainly made either a very high Compliment to the Author, or a very ill one to
the Publick."

{#6} It must be own'd, that when a Writer of any kind is so considerable as to
deserve the Labour and Pains of some shreud Heads to refute him in publick, he
may, in the quality of _an Author,_ be justly congratulated on that occasion.
'Tis suppos'd necessarily that he must have writ with some kind of Ability or
Wit. But if his _original_ Performance be in truth no better than ordinary; his
_Answerer's_ Task must certainly be very mean. He must be very indifferently
imploy'd, who wou'd take upon him to answer Nonsense in form, ridicule what is
of it-self _a Jest,_ and put it upon the World to read _a second Book_ for the
sake of the Impertinencys of _a former._

{#7} Taking it, however, for granted, "That a sorry Treatise may be the
foundation of a considerable Answer;" a _Reply_ still must certainly be
ridiculous, which-ever way we take it. For either the Author, in his original
Piece, has been truly refuted, or not. If refuted; why does he defend? If not
refuted; why trouble himself? What has the Publick to do with his private
Quarrels, or his Adversary's Impertinence? Or supposing the World out of
curiosity may delight to see _a Pedant_ expos'd by a Man of better Wit, and _a
Controversy_ thus unequally carry'd on between two such opposite Partys; How
long is this Diversion likely to hold good? And what will become of these
_polemick_ Writings a few Years hence? What is already become of those mighty
_Controversys,_ with which some of the most eminent Authors amus'd the World
within the memory of the youngest Scholar? An _original_ Work or two may perhaps
remain: But for the subsequent _Defenses,_ the _Answers, Rejoinders,_ and
_Replications;_ they have been long since paying their attendance to the
_Pastry-cooks._ Mankind perhaps were heated at that time, when first those
Matters were debated: But they are now cool again. They laugh'd: They carry'd on
the Humour: They blew the Coals: They teaz'd, and set on, maliciously, and to
create themselves diversion. But the _Jest_ is now over. No-one so much as
inquires Where the _Wit_ was; or Where possibly the _Sting_ shou'd lie of those
notable Reflections and satirical Hints, which were once found so pungent, and
gave the Readers such high Delight.—Notable _Philosophers_ and _Divines,_ who
can be contented to make sport, and write in learned _Billingsgate,_ to divert
the Coffee-house, and entertain the Assemblys at Booksellers Shops, or the more
airy Stalls of inferior Book-retailers!

{#8} It must be allow'd, That in this respect, _controversial Writing_ is not so
wholly unprofitable; and that for _Book_-Merchants, of whatever Kind or Degree,
they undoubtedly receive no small Advantage from a right Improvement of _a
learned Scuffle._ Nothing revives 'em more, or makes a quicker Trade, than a
_Pair_ of substantial _Divines_ or grave _Philosophers,_ well match'd, and
soundly back'd; till by long worrying one another, they are grown out of breath,
and have almost lost their Force of Biting.—"So have I known a crafty _Glazier,_
in time of Frost, procure a _Football,_ to draw into the Street the emulous
Chiefs of the robust Youth. The tumid Bladder bounds at every Kick, bursts the
withstanding _Casements,_ the _Chassys, Lanterns,_ and all the brittle vitrious
_Ware._ The Noise of Blows and Out-cries fills the whole Neighbourhood; and
Ruins of Glass cover the stony Pavements; till the bloated _battering Engine,_
subdu'd by force of Foot and Fist, and yielding up its Breath at many a fatal
Cranny, becomes lank and harmless, sinks in its Flight, and can no longer uphold
the Spirit of the contending Partys."

{#9} This our Author supposes to have been the occasion of his being so often
and zealously complimented by his _Amanuensis_ (for so he calls[n2] his
Bookseller or Printer) on the Fame of his first Piece. The obliging Crafts-man
has at times presented him with many a handsom Book, set off with Titles of
_Remarks, Reflections,_ and the like, which, as he assur'd him, were ^Answers^
to his small Treatise. "Here Sir! (says he) you have a considerable Hand has
undertaken you!——This Sir, is a _Reverend_—This a _Right Reverend_——This a
_noted_ Author——Will you not reply, Sir?——O' my word, Sir, the World is in
expectation." "Pity they shou'd be disappointed!" "A dozen Sheets, Sir, wou'd be
sufficient.—You might dispatch it presently." "Think you so?" "I have my Paper
ready—And a good Letter.—Take my word for it—You shall see, Sir!" "Enough. But
hark ye (Mr. _A, a, a, a_) my worthy _Engineer,_ and Manager of the War of
Letters! Ere you prepare your Artillery, or engage me in Acts of Hostility, let
me hear, I intreat you, Whether or no my Adversary be taken notice of.—Wait for
his _Second_ Edition. And if by next Year, or Year or two after, it be known in
good Company that there is such a Book in being, I shall then perhaps think it
time to consider of a _Reply._"
