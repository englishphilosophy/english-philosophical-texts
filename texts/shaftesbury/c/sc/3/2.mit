{#1} BUT to pass by these Cavils of a Philosophy, which speaks so much of
_Nature_ with so little meaning; we may with justice surely place it as a
Principle, "That if any thing be _natural,_ in any Creature, or any Kind; 'tis
that which is _preservative_ of the Kind it-self, and conducing to its Welfare
and Support." If in original and pure Nature, it be _wrong_ to break a Promise,
or be treacherous; 'tis as truly _wrong_ to be in any respect inhuman, or any
way wanting in our natural part towards human Kind. If _Eating_ and _Drinking_
be natural, _Herding_ is so too. If any _Appetite_ or _Sense_ be natural, the
_Sense of Fellowship_ is the same. If there be any thing of Nature in that
Affection which is between the Sexes, the Affection is certainly as natural
towards the consequent Offspring; and so again between the Offspring themselves,
as Kindred and Companions, bred under the same Discipline and Oeconomy. And thus
_a Clan_ or _Tribe_ is gradually form'd; _a Publick_ is recogniz'd: and besides
the Pleasure found in social Entertainment, Language, and Discourse, there is so
apparent a Necessity for continuing this good Correspondency and Union, that to
have no _Sense_ or Feeling of this kind, no Love of _Country, Community,_ or any
thing _in common,_ wou'd be the same as to be insensible even of the plainest
Means of _Self-Preservation,_ and most necessary Condition of _Self-Enjoyment._

{#2} How the Wit of Man shou'd so puzzle this Cause, as to make Civil Government
and Society appear a kind of Invention, and Creature of Art, I know not. For my
own part, methinks, this _herding_ Principle, and _associating_ Inclination, is
seen so _natural_ and strong in most Men, that one might readily affirm, 'twas
even from the Violence of this Passion that so much Disorder arose in the
general Society of Mankind.

{#3} Universal Good, or the Interest of _the World in general,_ is a kind of
remote philosophical Object. That _greater Community_ falls not easily under the
Eye. Nor is a National Interest, or that of a whole People, or Body Politick, so
readily apprehended. In less Partys, Men may be intimately conversant and
acquainted with one another. They can there better taste Society, and enjoy the
_common_ Good and Interest of a more contracted Publick. They view the whole
Compass and Extent of their Community; and see, and know particularly whom they
serve, and to what end they _associate_ and _conspire._ All Men have naturally
their share of this _combining_ Principle: and they who are of the sprightliest
and most active Facultys, have so large a share of it, that unless it be happily
directed by right Reason, it can never find Exercise for it-self in so remote a
Sphere as that of the Body Politick at large. For here perhaps the thousandth
part of those whose Interests are concern'd, are scarce so much as known by
sight. No visible Band is form'd; no strict Alliance: but the Conjunction is
made with different Persons, Orders, and Ranks of Men; not sensibly, but _in
Idea;_ according to that general View or Notion of _a State_ or _Commonwealth._

{#4} Thus the social Aim is disturb'd, for want of certain Scope. The _close
Sympathy_ and _conspiring Virtue_ is apt to lose it-self, for want of Direction,
in so wide a Field. Nor is the Passion any-where so strongly felt, or vigorously
exerted, as in actual _Conspiracy_ or _War;_ in which the highest Genius's are
often known the forwardest to employ themselves. For the most generous Spirits
are the most combining. They delight most to move in Concert; and _feel_ (if I
may so say) in the strongest manner, the force of _the confederating Charm._

{#5} 'Tis strange to imagine that _War,_ which of all things appears the most
savage, shou'd be the Passion of the most heroick Spirits. But 'tis in War that
the Knot of _Fellowship_ is closest drawn. 'Tis in War that mutual Succour is
most given, mutual Danger run, and _common Affection_ most exerted and employ'd.
For _Heroism_ and _Philanthropy_ are almost one and the same. Yet by a small
mis-guidance of the Affection, a Lover of Mankind becomes a Ravager: A Hero and
Deliverer becomes an Oppressor and Destroyer.

{#6} Hence other Divisions amongst Men. Hence, in the way of Peace and Civil
Government, that _Love of Party,_ and Subdivision by _Cabal._ For Sedition is a
kind of _cantonizing_ already begun within the State. To _cantonize_ is natural;
when the Society grows vast and bulky: And powerful States have found other
Advantages in sending Colonys abroad, than merely that of having Elbow-room at
home, or extending their Dominion into distant Countrys. Vast Empires are in
many respects unnatural: but particularly in this, That be they ever so well
constituted, the Affairs of many must, in such Governments, turn upon a very
few; and the Relation be less sensible, and in a manner lost, between the
Magistrate and People, in a Body so unwieldy in its Limbs, and whose Members lie
so remote from one another, and distant from the Head.

{#7} 'Tis in such Bodys as these that strong Factions are aptest to engender.
The associating Spirits, for want of Exercise, form new Movements, and seek a
narrower Sphere of Activity, when they want Action in a greater. Thus we have
_Wheels within Wheels._ And in some National Constitutions, notwithstanding the
Absurdity in Politicks, we have _one Empire within another._ Nothing is so
delightful as to incorporate. _Distinctions_ of many kinds are invented.
_Religious Societys_ are form'd. _Orders_ are erected; and their Interests
espous'd, and serv'd, with the utmost Zeal and Passion. Founders and Patrons of
this sort are never wanting. Wonders are perform'd, in this wrong social Spirit,
by those Members of separate Societys. And the _associating Genius_ of Man is
never better prov'd, than in those very Societys, which are form'd in opposition
to the general one of Mankind, and to the real Interest of the State.

{#8} In short, the very Spirit of _Faction,_ for the greatest part, seems to be
no other than the Abuse or Irregularity of that _social Love,_ and _common
Affection,_ which is natural to Mankind. For the Opposite of _Sociableness_ is
_Selfishness._ And of all Characters, the thorow-selfish one is the least
forward in _taking Party._ The Men of this sort are, in this respect, true _Men
of Moderation._ They are secure of their Temper; and possess themselves too
well, to be in danger of entering warmly into any Cause, or engaging deeply with
any Side or Faction.
