{#1} THE _Roman_ Satirist may be thought more than ordinarily satirical, when
speaking of the _Nobility_ and _Court,_ he is so far from allowing them to be
the Standard of Politeness and good Sense, that he makes 'em in a manner the
Reverse.

{#2} [n1]Rare is common sense in men of that rank.

{#3} Some of the[n2] most ingenious Commentators, however, interpret this very
differently from what is generally apprehended. They make this _Common Sense_ of
the Poet, by a _Greek_ Derivation, to signify _Sense_ of _Publick Weal,_ and of
the _Common Interest;_ Love of the _Community_ or _Society,_ natural Affection,
Humanity, Obligingness, or that sort of _Civility_ which rises from a just
_Sense_ of the _common Rights_ of Mankind, and the _natural Equality_ there is
among those of the same Species.

{#4} And indeed if we consider the thing nicely, it must seem somewhat hard in
the Poet, to have deny'd _Wit_ or _Ability_ to a Court such as that of ^Rome,^
even under a ^Tiberius^ or a ^Nero.^ But for _Humanity_ or _Sense of Publick
Good,_ and the _common Interest_ of Mankind, 'twas no such deep Satir to
question whether this was properly _the Spirit of a Court._ 'Twas difficult to
apprehend what _Community_ subsisted among Courtiers; or what _Publick_ between
an absolute Prince and his Slave-Subjects. And for real _Society,_ there cou'd
be none between such as had no other _Sense_ than that of _private Good._

{#5} Our Poet therefore seems not so immoderate in his Censure; if we consider
it is the _Heart,_ rather than the _Head,_ he takes to task: when reflecting on
a _Court-_Education, he thinks it unapt to raise any Affection towards a
_Country;_ and looks upon young Princes, and Lords, as _the young Masters_ of
the World; who being indulg'd in all their Passions, and train'd up in all
manner of Licentiousness, have that thorow Contempt and Disregard of Mankind,
which Mankind in a manner deserves, where Arbitrary Power is permitted, and a
Tyranny ador'd.

{#6} [n3] So much for the young man whom fame gives out as proud and puffed-up,
and full of his relationship to Nero.

{#7} A publick Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or _Sense of
Partnership_ with human Kind. Now there are none so far from being _Partners_ in
this _Sense,_ or Sharers in this _common Affection,_ as they who scarcely know
_an Equal,_ nor consider themselves as subject to any Law of _Fellowship_ or
_Community._ And thus Morality and good Government go together. There is no real
Love of Virtue, without the knowledg of _Publick Good._ And where absolute Power
is, there is no ^Publick.^

{#8} They who live under _a Tyranny,_ and have learnt to admire its Power as
Sacred and Divine, are debauch'd as much in their Religion, as in their Morals.
_Publick Good,_ according to their apprehension, is as little the Measure or
Rule of Government in _the Universe,_ as in _the State._ They have scarce a
Notion of what is good or just, other than as mere _Will_ and _Power_ have
determin'd. Omnipotence, they think, wou'd hardly be it-self, were it not at
liberty to[n4] dispense with the Laws of Equity, and change at pleasure the
Standard of moral Rectitude.

{#9} But notwithstanding the Prejudices and Corruptions of this kind, 'tis plain
there is something still of a _publick Principle,_ even where it is most
perverted and depress'd. The worst of Magistracys, _the mere Despotick kind,_
can shew sufficient Instances of Zeal and Affection towards it. Where no other
Government is known, it seldom fails of having that Allegiance and Duty paid it,
which is owing to a better Form. The Eastern Countrys, and many barbarous
Nations, have been and still are Examples of this kind. The personal Love they
bear their Prince, however severe towards them, may shew, how natural an
Affection there is towards Government and Order among Mankind. If Men have
_really_ no publick Parent, no Magistrate in common to cherish and protect 'em,
they will still _imagine_ they have such a one; and, like new-born Creatures who
have never seen their Dam, will fansy one for themselves, and apply (as by
Nature prompted) to some like Form, for Favour and Protection. In the room of a
_true Foster-Father,_ and _Chief,_ they will take after _a false one;_ and in
the room of a _legal Government_ and _just Prince,_ obey even _a Tyrant,_ and
endure a whole Lineage and Succession of such.

{#10} As for us ^Britons,^ thank Heaven, we have a better _Sense_ of Government
deliver'd to us from our Ancestors. We have the Notion of ^aPublick,^ and
^aConstitution;^ how _a Legislative,_ and how _an Executive_ is model'd. We
understand Weight and Measure in this kind, and can reason justly on the
_Balance of Power_ and _Property._ The Maxims we draw from hence, are as evident
as those in _Mathematicks._ Our increasing Knowledg shews us every day, more and
more, what ^CommonSense^ is in Politicks: And this must of necessity lead us to
understand a like _Sense_ in Morals; which is the Foundation.

{#11} ^'Tis^ ridiculous to say, there is any Obligation on Man to act sociably,
or honestly, in a form'd Government; and not in that which is commonly
call'd[n5] _the State of Nature._ For, to speak in the fashionable Language of
our modern Philosophy: "Society being founded on a Compact; the Surrender made
of every Man's private unlimited Right, into the hands of the Majority, or such
as the Majority shou'd appoint, was of free Choice, and by a Promise." Now _the
Promise_ it-self was made in the _State of Nature:_ And that which cou'd make _a
Promise_ obligatory in the State of Nature, must make _all_ other Acts of
Humanity as much our real Duty, and natural Part. Thus _Faith, Justice,
Honesty,_ and _Virtue,_ must have been as early as the State of Nature, or they
cou'd never have been _at all._ The Civil Union, or Confederacy, cou'd never
make _Right_ or _Wrong;_ if they subsisted not before. He who was free to any
Villany before his Contract, will, and ought to make as free with his Contract,
when he thinks fit. The _Natural Knave_ has the same reason to be _a Civil one;_
and may dispense with his politick Capacity as oft as he sees occasion: 'Tis
only _his Word_ stands in his way.—A Man is oblig'd _to keep his Word._ Why?
Because _he has given his_ _Word to keep it._—Is not this a notable Account of
the Original of moral Justice, and the Rise of Civil Government and Allegiance!

{#n1} ""$Rarus enim fermè _Sensus communis_ in illâ //
    Fortunâ—$ //
    [Juv. _Sat._ 8. _v._ 73.]""

{#n2} _Viz._ The two _Casaubons, Is._ and _Mer. Salmasius,_ and our _English
Gataker:_ See the first in _Capitolinus, Vit. M. Ant. sub finem._ The second in
his Comment on _M. Ant._ lib. 1. sect. 13, & 16. _Gataker_ on the same
place; and _Salmasius_ in the same Life of _Capitolinus,_ at the end of his
Annotations. The _Greek_ word is $Κοινονοημοσύνη$, which _Salmasius_ interprets,
"$moderatam, usitatam & ordinariam hominis mentem quae in commune quodammodo
consulit, nec omnia ad commodum suum refert, respectumque etiam habet eorum cum
quibus versatur, modestè, modicéque de se sentiens. At contra inflati &
superbi omnes se sibi tantùm suisque commodis natos arbitrantur, & prae se
caeteros contemnunt & negligunt; & hi sunt qui _Sensum Communem_ non
habere rectè dici possunt. Nam ita _Sensum Communem_ accipit _Juvenalis,_ Sat.
8. _Rarus enim fermè_ SENSUS COMMUNIS, _&c._ φιλανθρωπίαν & χρηστότητα
_Galenus_ vocat, quam Marcus de se loquens κοινονοημοσύνην; & alibi, ubi de
eadem re loquitur, Μετριότητα καὶ Εὐγνωμοσύνην, qua gratiam illi fecerit Marcus
simul eundi ad Germanicum Bellum ac sequendi se.$" In the same manner _Isaac
Casaubon: Herodianus,_ says he, calls this the $τὸ μέτριον καὶ ἰσόμετρον$.
"$Subjicit verò _Antoninus_ quasi hanc vocem interpretans, καὶ τὸ ἐφει̑σθαι τοὶς
φίλοις μήτε συνδειπνει̑ν αὐτῳ̑ πάντως, μήτε συναποδημει̑ν ἐπάναγκες.$" This, I
am persuaded, is the _Sensus Communis_ of ^Horace^, Sat. 3. lib. 1. which has
been unobserv'd, as far as I can learn, by any of his Commentators: it being
remarkable withal, that in this early Satir of ^Horace^, before his latter days,
and when his Philosophy as yet inclin'd to the less rigid Assertors of Virtue,
he puts this Expression (as may be seen by the whole Satir taken together) into
the Mouth of a _Crispinus,_ or some ridiculous Mimick of that severe Philosophy,
to which the Coinage of the word $κοινονοημοσύνη$ properly belong'd. For so the
Poet again ([_Sat._ 4. _v._ 77.]) uses the word $SENSUS$, speaking of those who
without _Sense_ of Manners, or common Society, without the least respect or
deference to others, press rudely upon their Friends, and upon all Company in
general, without regard to Time or Place, or any thing besides their selfish and
brutish Humour:
    ""$—Haud illud quaerentes, num sine SENSU, //
    Tempore num faciant alieno.——ἀναισθητω̑ς,$""
as old _Lambin_ interprets it, tho without any other Explanation; referring only
to the _Sensus Communis_ of ^Horace^ in that other Satir. Thus ^Seneca,^ Epist.
105. $Odium autem ex offensa sic vitabis, neminem lacessendo gratuitò: à quo te
SENSUS COMMUNIS tuebitur.$ And ^Cicero^ accordingly, $Justitiae partes sunt, non
violare homines: Verecundiae, non offendere.$ [Lib. 1. de Off.] It may be
objected possibly by some, particularly vers'd in the Philosophy
above-mention'd, that the $κοίνος νοὺς$, to which the $Κοινονοημοσύνη$ seems to
have relation, is of a different meaning. But they will consider withal how
small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the $ὑπόληψις$, and the
vulgar $αἴσθησις$; how generally _Passion_ was by those Philosophers brought
under the Head of _Opinion._ And when they consider, besides this, the very
Formation of the word $Κοινονοημοσύνη$ upon the Model of the other femaliz'd
Virtues, the $Εὐγνωμοσύνη$, $Σωφροσύνη$, $Δικαιοσύνη$, _&c._ they will no
longer hesitate on this Interpretation.—The Reader may perhaps by this Note see
better why the _Latin_ Title of _Sensus Communis_ has been given to this second
Treatise. He may observe, withal, how the same Poet ^Juvenal^ uses the word
_Sensus,_ in Sat. 15. $Haec nostri pars optima Sensûs.$
