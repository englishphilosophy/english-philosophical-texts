{#1} I HAVE been considering (my Friend!) what your Fancy was, to express such a
surprize as you did the other day, when I happen'd to speak to you in
commendation of _Raillery._ Was it possible you shou'd suppose me so grave a
Man, as to dislike _all_ Conversation of this kind? Or were you afraid I shou'd
not stand the trial, if you put me to it, by making the experiment in _my own_
Case?

{#2} I must confess, you had reason enough for your Caution; if you cou'd
imagine me at the bottom so true _a Zealot,_ as not to bear the least Raillery
on my own Opinions. 'Tis the Case, I know, with many. Whatever they think grave
or solemn, they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way: Tho
what _Another_ thinks so, they can be contented to treat otherwise; and are
forward to try the Edge of Ridicule against any Opinions besides _their own._

{#3} The Question is, Whether this be fair or no? and, Whether it be not just
and reasonable, to make as free with our _own_ Opinions, as with those of _other
People?_ For to be sparing in this case, may be look'd upon as a piece of
Selfishness. We may be charg'd perhaps with wilful Ignorance and blind Idolatry,
for having taken Opinions upon Trust, and consecrated in our-selves certain
_Idol-_Notions, which we will never suffer to be unveil'd, or seen in open
light. They may perhaps be Monsters, and not Divinitys, or Sacred Truths, which
are kept thus choicely, in some dark Corner of our Minds: The Specters may
impose on us, whilst we refuse to turn 'em every way, and view their Shapes and
Complexions in every light. For that which can be shewn only in _a certain_
Light, is questionable. Truth, 'tis suppos'd, may bear _all_ Lights: and _one_
of those principal Lights or natural Mediums, by which Things are to be view'd,
in order to a thorow Recognition, is _Ridicule_ it-self, or that Manner of Proof
by which we discern whatever is liable to just Raillery in any Subject. So much,
at least, is allow'd by All, who at any time appeal to this _Criterion._ The
gravest Gentlemen, even in the gravest Subjects, are suppos'd to acknowledg
this: and can have no Right, 'tis thought, to deny others the Freedom of this
Appeal; whilst they are free to censure like other Men, and in their gravest
Arguments make no scruple to ask, _Is it not Ridiculous?_

{#4} Of this Affair, therefore, I design you shou'd know fully what my
Sentiments are. And by this means you will be able to judg of me; whether I was
sincere the other day in the Defence of _Raillery,_ and can continue still to
plead for those ingenious Friends of ours, who are often censur'd for their
Humour of this kind, and for the Freedom they take in such an airy way of
Conversation and Writing.
