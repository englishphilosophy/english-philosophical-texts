_And if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
Saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self._

{#1} It is commonly observed, that there is a disposition in men to complain of
the viciousness and corruption of the age in which they live, as greater than
that of former ones: which is usually followed with this further observation,
that mankind has been in that respect much the same in all times. Now, to
determine whether this last be not contradicted by the accounts of history: thus
much can scarce be doubted, that vice and folly takes different turns, and some
particular kinds of it are more open and avowed in some ages than in others;
and, I suppose, it may be spoken of as very much the distinction of the present,
to profess a contracted spirit, and greater regards to self-interest, than
appears to have been done formerly. Upon this account it seems worth while to
inquire, whether private interest is likely to be promoted in proportion to the
degree in which self-love engrosses us, and prevails over all other principles;
"or whether the contracted affection may not possibly be so prevalent as to
disappoint itself, and even contradict its own end, private good?"

{#2} And since, further, there is generally thought to be some peculiar kind of
contrariety between self-love and the love of our neighbour—between the pursuit
of public and of private good; insomuch, that when you are recommending one of
these, you are supposed to be speaking against the other; and from hence arises
a secret prejudice against, and frequently open scorn of, all talk of public
spirit and real good-will to our fellow-creatures; it will be necessary to
"inquire what respect benevolence hath to self-love, and the pursuit of private
interest to the pursuit of public?" Or whether there be anything of that
peculiar inconsistence and contrariety between them, over and above what there
is between self-love and other passions and particular affections, and their
respective pursuits?

{#3} These inquiries, it is hoped, may be favourably attended to; for there
shall be all possible concessions made to the favourite passion, which hath so
much allowed to it, and whose cause is so universally pleaded; it shall be
treated with the utmost tenderness and concern for its interests. In order to
this, as well as to determine the fore-mentioned questions, it will be necessary
to consider the nature, the object, and end of that self-love, as distinguished
from other principles or affections in the mind, and their respective objects.

{#4} Every man hath a general desire of his own happiness; and likewise a
variety of particular affections, passions, and appetites, to particular
external objects. The former proceeds from, or is, self-love, and seems
inseparable from all sensible creatures, who can reflect upon themselves and
their own interest or happiness, so as to have that interest an object to their
minds: what is to be said of the latter is, that they proceed from, or together
make up, that particular nature, according to which man is made. The object the
former pursues is somewhat internal, our own happiness, enjoyment, satisfaction;
whether we have or have not a distinct particular perception what it is, or
wherein it consists: the objects of the latter are this or that particular
external thing, which the affections tend towards, and of which it hath always a
particular idea or perception. The principle we call self-love never seeks
anything external for the sake of the thing, but only as a means of happiness or
good: particular affections rest in the external things themselves. One belongs
to man as a reasonable creature reflecting upon his own interest or happiness;
the other, though quite distinct from reason, are as much a part of human
nature.

{#5} That all particular appetites and passions are towards external things
themselves, distinct from the pleasure arising from them, is manifested from
hence, that there could not be this pleasure, were it not for that prior
suitableness between the object and the passion: there could be no enjoyment or
delight for one thing more than another, from eating food more than from
swallowing a stone, if there were not an affection or appetite to one thing more
than another.

{#6} Every particular affection, even the love of our neighbour, is as really
our own affection, as self-love; and the pleasure arising from its gratification
is as much my own pleasure, as the pleasure self-love would have from knowing I
myself should, be happy some time hence, would be my own pleasure. And if,
because every particular affection is a man's own, and the pleasure arising from
its gratification his own pleasure, or pleasure to himself, such particular
affection must be called self-love. According to this way of speaking, no
creature whatever can possibly act but merely from self-love; and every action
and every affection whatever is to be resolved up into this one principle. But
then this is not the language of mankind: or, if it were, we should want words
to express the difference between the principle of an action, proceeding from
cool consideration that it will be to my own advantage; and an action, suppose
of revenge, or of friendship, by which a man runs upon certain ruin, to do evil
or good to another. It is manifest the principles of these actions are totally
different, and so want different words to be distinguished by: all that they
agree in is, that they both proceed from, and are done to gratify an inclination
in a man's self. But the principle or inclination in one case is self-love; in
the other, hatred, or love of another. There is then a distinction between the
cool principle of self-love, or general desire of our own happiness, as one part
of our nature, and one principle of action; and the particular affections
towards particular external objects, as another part of our nature, and another
principle of action. How much soever, therefore, is to be allowed to self-love,
yet it cannot be allowed to be the whole of our inward constitution; because,
you see, there are other parts or principles which come into it.

{#7} Further, private happiness or good is all which self-love can make us
desire or be concerned about. In having this consists its gratification; it is
an affection to ourselves—a regard to our own interest, happiness, and private
good: and in the proportion a man hath this, he is interested, or a lover of
himself. Let this be kept in mind, because there is commonly, as I shall
presently have occasion to observe, another sense put upon these words. On the
other hand, particular affections tend towards particular external things; these
are their objects; having these is their end; in this consists their
gratification: no matter whether it be, or be not, upon the whole, our interest
or happiness. An action, done from the former of these principles, is called an
interested action. An action, proceeding from any of the latter, has its
denomination of passionate, ambitions, friendly, revengeful, or any other, from
the particular appetite or affection from which it proceeds. Thus self-love, as
one part of human nature, and the several particular principles as the other
part, are themselves, their objects, and ends, stated and shown.

{#8} From hence it will be easy to see how far, and in what ways, each of these
can contribute and be subservient to the private good of the individual.
Happiness does not consist in self-love. The desire of happiness is no more the
thing itself, than the desire of riches is the possession or enjoyment of them.
People may love themselves with the most entire and unbounded affection, and yet
be extremely miserable. Neither can self-love any way help them out, but by
setting them on work to get rid of the causes of their misery, to gain or make
use of those objects which are by nature adapted to afford satisfaction.
Happiness or satisfaction consists only in the enjoyment of those objects which
are by nature suited to our several particular appetites, passions, and
affections. So that if self-love wholly engrosses us, and leaves no room for any
other principle, there can be absolutely no such thing at all as happiness or
enjoyment of any kind whatever; since happiness consists in the gratification of
particular passions, which supposes the having of them. Self-love then does not
constitute this or that to be our interest or good; but our interest or good
being constituted by nature and supposed self-love, only puts us upon obtaining
and securing it. Therefore, if it be possible that self-love may prevail and
exert itself in a degree or manner which is not subservient to this end, then it
will not follow that our interest will be promoted in proportion to the degree
in which that principle engrosses us, and prevails over others. Nay, farther,
the private and contracted affection, when it is not subservient to this end,
private good, may, for anything that appears, have a direct contrary tendency
and effect And if we will consider the matter, we shall see that it often really
has. Disengagement is absolutely necessary to enjoyment; and a person may have
so steady and fixed an eye upon his own interest, whatever he places it in, as
may hinder him from attending to many gratifications within his reach, which
others have their minds free and open to. Over-fondness for a child is not
generally thought to be for its advantage; and, if there be any guess to be made
from appearances, surely that character we call selfish is not the most
promising for happiness. Such a temper may plainly be, and exert itself in a
degree and manner which may give unnecessary and useless solicitude and anxiety,
in a degree and manner which may prevent obtaining the means and materials of
enjoyment, as well as the making use of them. Immoderate self-love does very ill
consult its own interest; and how much soever a paradox it may appear, it is
certainly true, that, even from self-love, we should endeavour to get over all
inordinate regard to, and consideration of, ourselves. Every one of our passions
and affections hath its natural stint and bound, which may easily be exceeded;
whereas our enjoyments can possibly be but in a determinate measure and degree.
Therefore such excess of the affection, since it cannot procure any enjoyment,
must in all cases be useless, but is generally attended with inconveniences, and
often is down-right pain and misery. This holds as much with regard to self-love
as to all other affections. The natural degree of it, so far as it sets us on
work to gain and make use of the materials of satisfaction, may be to our real
advantage: but beyond or beside this, it is in several respects an inconvenience
and disadvantage. Thus it appears that private interest is so far from being
likely to promoted in proportion to the degree in which self-love engrosses us,
and prevails over all other principles, that the contracted affection maybe so
prevalent as to disappoint itself and even contradict its own end, private good.

{#9} "But who, except the most sordidly covetous, ever thought there was any
rivalship between the love of greatness, honour, power, or between sensual
appetites, and self-love? No; there is a perfect harmony between them. It is by
means of these particular appetites and affections that self-love is gratified
in enjoyment, happiness, and satisfaction. The competition and rivalship is
between self-love and the love of our neighbour. That affection which leads us
out of ourselves, makes us regardless of our own interest, and substitute that
of another in its stead." Whether then there be any peculiar competition and
contrariety in this case, shall now be considered.

{#10} Self-love and interestedness was stated to consist in or be an affection
to ourselves, a regard to our own private good: it is, therefore, distinct from
benevolence, which is an affection to the good of our fellow-creatures. But that
benevolence is distinct from, that is, not the same thing with self-love, is no
reason for its being looked upon with any peculiar suspicion, because every
principle whatever, by means of which self-love is gratified, is distinct from
it. And all things, which are distinct from each other, are equally so. A man
has an affection or aversion to another: that one of these tends to, and is
gratified by doing good, that the other tends to, and is gratified by doing
harm, does not in the least alter the respect which either one or the other of
these inward feelings has to self-love. We use the word property so as to
exclude any other persons having an interest in that, of which we say a
particular man has the property: and we often use the word selfish so as to
exclude in the same manner all regards to the good of others. But the cases are
not parallel: for though that exclusion is really part of the idea of property,
yet such positive exclusion, or bringing this peculiar disregard to the good of
others into the idea of self-love, is in reality adding to the idea, or changing
it from what it was before stated to consist in, namely, in an affection to
ourselves.\* This being the whole idea of self-love, it can no otherwise exclude
good-will or love of others, than merely by not including it, no otherwise than
it excludes love of arts, or reputation, or of anything else. Neither, on the
other hand, does benevolence, any more than love of arts or of reputation,
exclude self-love. Love of our neighbour, then, has just the same respect to, is
no more distant from self-love, than hatred of our neighbour, or than love and
hatred of anything else. Thus the principles, from which men rush upon certain
ruin for the destruction of an enemy, and for the preservation of a friend, have
the same respect to the private affection, are equally interested, or equally
disinterested: and it is of no avail, whether they are said to be one or the
other. Therefore, to those who are shocked to hear virtue spoken of as
disinterested, it may be allowed, that it is indeed absurd to speak thus of it;
unless hatred, several particular instances of vice, and all the common
affections and aversions in mankind, are acknowledged to be disinterested too.
Is there any less inconsistence between the love of inanimate things, or of
creatures merely sensitive, and self-love, than between self-love, and the love
of our neighbour? Is desire of, and delight in the happiness of another any more
a diminution of self-love, than desire of and delight in the esteem of another?
They are both equally desire of and delight in somewhat external to ourselves:
either both or neither are so. The object of self-love is expressed in the term
self: and every appetite of sense, and every particular affection of the hearty
are equally interested or disinterested, because the objects of them all are
equally self or somewhat else. Whatever ridicule, therefore, the mention of a
disinterested principle or action may be supposed to lie open to, must, upon the
matter being thus stated, relate to ambition, and every appetite and particular
affection, as much as to benevolence. And indeed all the ridicule, and all the
grave perplexity, of which this subject hath had its full share, is merely from
words. The most intelligible way of speaking of it seems to be this: that
self-love, and the actions done in consequence of it, (for these will presently
appear to be the same as to this question,) are interested; that particular
affections towards external objects, and the actions done in consequence of
those affections, are not so. But every one is at liberty to use words as he
pleases. All that is here insisted upon is, that ambition, revenge, benevolence,
all particular passions whatever, and the actions they produce, are equally
interested or disinterested.

{#11} Thus it appears, that there is no peculiar contrariety between self-love
and benevolence; no greater competition between these, than between any other
particular affections and self-love. This relates to the affections themselves.
Let us now see whether there be any peculiar contrariety between the respective
courses of life which these affections lead to; whether there be any greater
competition between the pursuit of private and of public good, than between any
other particular pursuits and that of private good.

{#12} There seems no other reason to suspect that there is any such peculiar
contrariety, but only that the course of action which benevolence leads to, has
a more direct tendency to promote the good of others, than that course of
action, which love of reputation, suppose, or any other particular affection,
leads to. But that any affection tends to the happiness of another, does not
hinder its tending to one's own happiness too. That others enjoy the benefit of
the air and the light of the sun, does not hinder but that these are as much
one's own private advantage now, as they would be if we had the property of them
exclusive of all others. So a pursuit which tends to promote the good of
another, yet may have as great tendency to promote private interest, as a
pursuit which does not tend to the good of another at all, or which is
mischievous to him. All particular affections whatever, resentment, benevolence,
love of arts, equally lead to a course of action for their own gratification,
i.e., the gratification of ourselves: and the gratification of each gives
delight: so far, then, it is manifest they have all the same respect to private
interest. Now, take into consideration further, concerning these three pursuits,
that the end of the first is the harm; of the second, the good of another; of
the last, somewhat indifferent: and is there any necessity, that these
additional considerations should alter the respect which we before saw these
three pursuits had to private interest; or render any one of them less conducive
to it than any other? Thus, one man's affection is to honour, as his end; in
order to obtain which, he thinks no pains too great. Suppose another, with such
a singularity of mind, as to have the same affection to public good, as his end,
which he endeavours with the same labour to obtain. In case of success, surely
the man of benevolence hath as great enjoyment as the man of ambition; they both
equally having the end, their affections, in the same degree, tended to; but in
case of disappointment, the benevolent man has clearly the advantage; since
endeavouring to do good, considered as a virtuous pursuit, is gratified by its
own consciousness, i.e., is in a degree its own reward.

{#13} And as to these two, or benevolence and any other particular passions
whatever, considered in a further view, as forming a general temper, which more
or less disposes us for enjoyment of all the common blessings of life, distinct
from their own gratification: is benevolence less the temper of tranquillity and
freedom, than ambition or covetousness? Does the benevolent man appear less easy
with himself, from his love to his neighbour? Does he less relish his being? Is
there any peculiar gloom seated on his face? Is his mind less open to
entertainment, or to any particular gratification? Nothing is more manifest,
than that being in good humour, which is benevolence whilst it lasts, is itself
the temper of satisfaction and enjoyment.

{#14} Suppose, then, a man sitting down to consider how he might become most
easy to himself, and attain the greatest pleasure he could; all that which is
his real natural happiness; this can only consist in the enjoyment of those
objects which are by nature adapted to our several faculties. These particular
enjoyments make up the sum total of our happiness; and they are supposed to
arise from riches, honours, and the gratification of sensual appetites. Be it
so: yet none profess themselves so completely happy in these enjoyments, but
that there is room left in the mind for others, if they were presented to them.
Nay, these, as much as they engage us, are not thought so high, but that human
nature is capable even of greater. Now there have been persons in all ages, who
have professed that they found satisfaction in the exercise of charity, in the
love of their neighbour, in endeavouring to promote the happiness of all they
had to do with, and in the pursuit of what is just, and right, and good, as the
general bent of their mind and end of their life; and that doing an action of
baseness or cruelty, would be as great violence to their self as much breaking
in upon their nature, as any external force. Persons of this character would
add, if they might be heard, that they consider themselves as acting in the view
of an infinite Being, who is in a much higher sense the object of reverence and
of love, than all the world besides; and, therefore, they could have no more
enjoyment from a wicked action done under his eye, than the persons to whom they
are making their apology could, if all mankind were the spectators of it; and
that the satisfaction of approving themselves to his unerring judgment, to whom
they thus refer all their actions, is a more continued settled satisfaction than
any this world can afford; as also that they have, no less than others, a mind
free and open to all the common innocent gratifications of it such as they are.
And, if we go no further, does there appear any absurdity in this? Will any one
take upon him to say, that a man cannot find his account in this general course
of life, as much as in the most unbounded ambition, or the excesses of pleasure?
Or that such a person has not consulted so well for himself, for the
satisfaction and peace of his own mind, as the ambitious or dissolute man? And
though the consideration, that God himself will in the end justify their taste,
and support their cause, is not formally to be insisted upon here; yet thus much
comes in, that all enjoyments whatever are much more clear and unmixed, from the
assurance that they will end well. Is it certain, then, that there is nothing in
these pretensions to happiness, especially when there are not wanting persons,
who have supported themselves with satisfactions of this kind in sickness,
poverty, disgrace, and in the very pangs of death? whereas, it is manifest all
other enjoyments fail in these circumstances. This surely looks suspicious of
having somewhat in it. Self-love, methinks, should be alarmed. May she not
possibly pass over greater pleasures, than those she is so wholly taken up with?

{#15} The short of the matter is no more than this. Happiness consists in the
gratification of certain affections, appetites, passions, with objects which are
by nature adapted to them. Self-love may indeed set us on work to gratify these:
but happiness or enjoyment has no immediate connexion with self-love, but arises
from such gratification alone. Love of our neighbour is one of those affections.
This, considered as a virtuous principle, is gratified by a consciousness of
endeavouring to promote the good of others: but considered as a natural
affection, its gratification consists in the actual accomplishment of this
endeavour. Now, indulgence or gratification of this affection, whether in that
consciousness, or this accomplishment, has the same respect to interest, as
indulgence of any other affection; they equally proceed from, or do not proceed
from, self-love; they equally include, or equally exclude, this principle. Thus
it appears, that "benevolence and the pursuit of public good have at least as
great respect to self-love and the pursuit of private good, as any other
particular passions, and their respective pursuits."

{#16} Neither is covetousness, whether as a temper or pursuit, any exception to
this. For if by covetousness is meant the desire and pursuit of riches for their
own sake, without any regard to or consideration of the uses of them; this hath
as little to do with self-love, as benevolence hath. But by this word is usually
meant, not such madness and total distraction of mind, but immoderate affection
to and pursuit of riches as possessions, in order to some further end; namely,
satisfaction, interest, or good. This, therefore, is not a particular affection,
or particular pursuit, but it is the general principle of self-love, and the
general pursuit of our own interest; for which reason, the word selfish is by
every one appropriated to this temper and pursuit. Now, as it is ridiculous to
assert that self-love and the love of our neighbour are the same; so neither is
it asserted that following these different affections hath the same tendency and
respect to our own interest. The comparison is not between self-love and the
love of our neighbour; between pursuit of our own interest, and the interest of
others; but between the several particular affections in human nature towards
external objects, as one part of the comparison; and the one particular
affection to the good of our neighbour, as the one part of it: and it has been
shown, that all these have the same respect to self-love and private interest.

{#17} There is indeed frequently an inconsistence, or interfering between
self-love or private interest, and the several particular appetites, passions,
affections, or the pursuits they lead to. But this competition or interfering is
merely accidental, and happens much oftener between pride, revenge, sensual
gratifications, and private interest, than between private interest and
benevolence. For nothing is more common than to see men give themselves up to a
passion or an affection to their known prejudice and ruin, and in direct
contradiction to manifest and real interest, and the loudest calls of self-love:
whereas the seeming competitions and interfering between benevolence and private
interest, relate much more to the materials or means of enjoyment, than to
enjoyment itself. There is often an interfering in the former, where there is
none in the latter. Thus, as to riches: so much money as a man gives away, so
much less will remain in his possession. Here is a real interfering. But though
a man cannot possibly give without lessening his fortune, yet there are
multitudes might give without lessening their own enjoyment; because they may
have more than they can turn to any real use or advantage to themselves. Thus,
the more thought and time any one employs about the interests and good of
others, he must necessarily have less to attend his own; but he may have so
ready and large a supply of his own wants, that such thought might be really
useless to himself, though of great service and assistance to others.

{#18} The general mistake, that there is some greater inconsistence between
endeavouring to promote the good of another and self-interest, than between
self-interest and pursuing anything else, seems, as hath already been hinted, to
arise from our notions of property; and to be carried on by this property's
being supposed to be itself our happiness or good. People are so very much taken
up with this one subject, that they seem from it to have formed a general way of
thinking, which they apply to other things that they have nothing to do with.
Hence, in a confused and slight way, it might well be taken for granted, that
another's having no interest in an affection, (i.e., his good not being the
object of it,) renders, as one may speak, the proprietor's interest in it
greater; and that if another had an interest in it, this would render his less,
or occasion that such affection could not be so friendly to self-love, or
conducive to private good, as an affection or pursuit which has not a regard to
the good of another. This, I say, might be taken for granted, whilst it was not
attended to, that the object of every particular affection is equally somewhat
external to ourselves: and whether it be the good of another person, or whether
it be any other external thing, makes no alteration with regard to its being
one's own affection, and the gratification of it one's own private enjoyment.
And so far as it is taken for granted, that barely having the means and
materials of enjoyment is what constitutes interest and happiness; that our
interest and good consists in possessions themselves, in having the property of
riches, houses, lands, gardens, not in the enjoyment of them; so far it will
even more strongly be taken for granted, in the way already explained, that an
affection's conducing to the good of another, must even necessarily occasion it
to conduce less to private good, if not to be positively detrimental to it. For,
if property and happiness are one and the same thing, as by increasing the
property of another, you lessen your own property, so by promoting the happiness
of another, you must lessen your own happiness. But whatever occasioned the
mistake, I hope it has been fully proved to be one; as it has been proved, that
there is no peculiar rivalsliip or competition between self-love and
benevolence; that as there may be a competition between these two, so there may
also between any particular affection whatever and self-love; that every
particular affection, benevolence among the rest, is subservient to self-love,
by being the instrument of private enjoyment; and that in one respect
benevolence contributes more to private interest, i.e., enjoyment or
satisfaction, than any other of the particular common affections, as it is in a
degree its own gratification.

{#19} And to all these things may be added, that religion, from whence arises
our strongest obligation to benevolence, is so far from disowning the principle
of self-love, that it often addresses itself to that very principle, and always
to the mind in that state when reason presides; and there can no access be had
to the understanding, but by convincing men, that the course of life we would
persuade them to is not contrary to their interest. It may be allowed, without
any prejudice to the cause of virtue and religion, that our ideas of happiness
and misery are, of all our ideas, the nearest and most important to us; that
they will, nay, if you please, that they ought to prevail over those of order,
and beauty, and harmony, and proportion, if there should ever be, as it is
impossible there ever should be, any inconsistency between them; though these
last, too, as expressing the fitness of actions, are real as truth itself. Let
it be allowed, though virtue or moral rectitude does indeed consist in affection
to and pursuit of what is right and good, as such: yet that, when we sit down in
a cool hour, we can neither justify to ourselves this or any other pursuit, till
we are convinced that it will be for our happiness, or at least not contrary to
it.

{#20} Common reason and humanity will have some influence upon mankind, whatever
becomes of speculations: but, so far as the interests of virtue depend upon the
theory of it being secured from open scorn, so far its very being in the world
depends upon its appearing to have no contrariety to private interest and
self-love. The foregoing observations, therefore, it is hoped, may have gained a
little ground in favour of the precept before us, the particular explanation of
which shall be the subject of the next discourse.

{#21} I will conclude, at present, with observing the peculiar obligation which
we are under to virtue and religion, as enforced in the verses following the
text, in the epistle for the day, from our Saviour's coming into the world. "The
night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us, therefore, cast off the works of
darkness, and let us put on the armour of light," &c. The meaning and force of
which exhortion is, that Christianity lays us under new obligations to a good
life, as by it the will of God is more clearly revealed, and as it affords
additional motives to the practice of it, over and above those which arise out
of the nature of virtue and vice; I might add, as our Saviour has set us a
perfect example of goodness in our own nature. Now, love and charity is plainly
the thing in which he had placed his religion; in which, therefore, as we have
any pretence to the name of Christians, we must place ours. He hath at once
enjoined it upon us by way of command, with peculiar force: and by his example,
as having undertaken the work of our salvation, out of pure love and good- will
to mankind. The endeavour to set home this example upon our minds is a very
proper employment of this season, which is bringing on the festival of his
birth; which, as it may teach us many excellent lessons of humility,
resignation, and obedience to the will of God; so there is none it recommends
with greater authority, force, and advantage, than this of love and charity;
since it was "for us men, and for our salvation, that he came down from heaven,
and was incarnate, and was made man;" that he might teach us our duty, and more
especially that he might enforce the practice of it, reform mankind, and finally
bring us to that "eternal salvation, of which he is the Author to all those that
obey him."
