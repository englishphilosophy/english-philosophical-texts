_And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness
unto all nations._

THE general Doctrine of Religion, that all things are under the direction of one
righteous Governor, having been established by repeated revelations in the first
ages of the world, was left with the bulk of mankind, to be honestly preserved
pure and entire, or carelessly forgotten, or wilfully corrupted. And though
reason, almost intuitively, bare witness to the truth of this moral system of
nature, yet it soon appeared, that "they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge," Rom. i. 28, as to any purposes of real piety. Natural religion
became gradually more and more darkened with superstition, little understood,
less regarded in practice; and the face of it scarce discernible at all, in the
religious establishments of the most learned, polite nations. And how much
soever could have been done towards the revival of it by the light of reason,
yet this light could not have discovered what so nearly concerned us, that
important part in the scheme of this world which regards a Mediator; nor how far
the settled constitution of its government admitted repentance to be accepted
for remission of sins, after the obscure intimations of these things, from
tradition, were corrupted or forgotten. One people, indeed, had clearer notices
of them, together with the genuine scheme of natural religion preserved in the
primitive and subsequent revelations committed to their trust; and were designed
to be a witness of God, and a providence to the nations around them: but this
people also had corrupted themselves and their religion to the highest degree
that was consistent with keeping up the form of it.

In this state of things, when Infinite Wisdom saw proper, the general doctrine
of religion was authoritatively republished in its purity; and the particular
dispensation of Providence, which this world is under, manifested to all men,
even "the dispensation of the grace of God towards us," Eph. iii. 2, as sinful,
lost creatures, to be recovered by repentance through a Mediator, who was "to
make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness,"
Dan. ix. 24, and at length established that new state of things foretold by the
prophet Daniel, under the character of "a kingdom, which the God of heaven would
set up, and which should never be destroyed," Dan. ii. 44. This, including a
more distinct account of the instituted means whereby Christ the Mediator would
"gather together in one, the children of God that were scattered abroad," John
xi. 52, and conduct them to "the place he is gone to prepare for them," John
xiv. 2, 3; is the gospel of the kingdom, which he here foretells, and elsewhere
commands, should "be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations;
and it first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them
that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and
with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will,"
Heb. ii. 8, 4: by which means it was spread very widely among the nations of the
world, and became a witness unto them.

When thus much was accomplished, as there is a wonderful uniformity in the
conduct of Providence, Christianity was left with Christians, to be transmitted
down pore and genuine, or to be corrupted and sunk; in like manner as the
religion of nature had been left with mankind in general There was however this
difference, that by an institution of external religion fitted for all men,
(consisting in a common form of Christian, worship, together with a standing
ministry of instruction and discipline,) it pleased God to unite Christians in
communities or visible churches, and all along to preserve them, over a great
part of the world; and thus perpetuate a general publication of the gospel. For
these communities, which together make up the catholic visible church, are,
First, The repositories of the written oracles of God: and in every age have
preserved and published them in every country, where the profession of
Christianity has obtained. Hence it has come to pass, and it is a thing very
much to be observed in the appointment of Providence, that even such of these
communities as, in a long succession of years, have corrupted Christianity the
most, have yet continually carried, together with their corruptions, the
confutation of them; for they have everywhere preserved the pure original
standard of it, the Scripture, to which recourse might have been had, both by
the deceivers and the deceived, in every successive age. Secondly, Any
particular church, in whatever place established, is like "a city that is set on
a hill, which cannot be hid," Matt. v. 14, inviting all who pass by to enter
into it. All persons to whom any notices of it come, have, in Scripture
language, the "kingdom of God come nigh unto them." They are reminded of that
religion which natural conscience attests the truth of; and they may, if they
will, be instructed in it more distinctly, and likewise in the gracious means
whereby sinful creatures may obtain eternal life; that chief and final good,
which all men, in proportion to their understanding and integrity, even in all
ages and countries of the heathen world, were ever in pursuit of. And, lastly,
Out of these churches have all along gone forth persons who have preached the
gospel in remote places with greater or less good effect: for the establishment
of any profession of Christianity, however corrupt, I call a good effect, whilst
accompanied with a continued publication of the Scripture, notwithstanding it
may for some time lie quite neglected.

From these things, it may be worth observing, by the way, appears the weakness
of all pleas for neglecting the public service of the church. For though a man
prays with as much devotion and less interruption at home, and reads better
sermons there, yet that will by no means excuse the neglect of his appointed
part in keeping up the profession of Christianity amongst mankind. And this
neglect, were it universal, must be the dissolution of the whole visible church,
i.e., of all Christian communities; and so must prevent those good purposes
which were intended to be answered by them, and which they have all along
answered over the world. For we see, that by their means the event foretold in
the text, which began in the preaching of Christ and the apostles, has been
carried on, more or less, ever since, and is still carrying on; these being the
providential means of its progress. And it is, I suppose, the completion of this
event which St. John had a representation of under the figure of "an angel
flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them
that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people," Rev. xiv. 6.

Our Lord adds in the text, that this should be "for a witness unto them;" for an
evidence of their duty, and an admonition to perform it. But what would be the
effect or success of the general preaching of the gospel, is not here mentioned.
And therefore the prophecy of the text is not parallel to those others in
Scripture, which seemed to foretell the glorious establishment of Christianity
in the last days; nor does it appear that they are coincident, otherwise than as
the former of these events must be supposed preparatory to the latter. Nay, it
is not said here, that God "willeth all men should be saved, and come unto the
knowledge of the truth," 1 Tim. ii. 4, though this is the language of Scripture
elsewhere. The text declares no more, than that it was the appointment of God,
in his righteous government over the world, that "the gospel of the kingdom
should be preached for a witness unto it."

The visible constitution and course of nature, the moral law written in our
hearts, the positive institutions of religion, and even any memorial of it, are
all spoken of in Scripture under this or the like denomination: so are the
prophets, apostles, and our Lord himself. They are all witnesses, for the most
part unregarded witnesses, in behalf of God, to mankind. They inform us of his
being and providence, and of the particular dispensation of religion which we
are under; and continually remind us of them; and they are equally witnesses of
these things, whether we regard them or not. Thus, after a declaration that
Ezekiel should be sent with a Divine message to the children of Israel, it is
added, "and they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they
are a rebellious house, yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among
them," Ezek. ii. 5, 7. And our Lord directs the seventy disciples, upon their
departure from any city which refused to receive them, to declare,
"notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto
you," Luke x. 11. The thing intended in both these passages is that which is
expressed in the text by the word "witness." And all of them together evidently
suggest thus much, that the purposes of Providence are carried on, by the
preaching of the gospel, to those who reject it as well as to those who embrace
it. It is indeed true, "God willeth that all men should be saved," yet from the
unalterable constitution of his government, the salvation of every man cannot
but depend upon his behaviour, and therefore cannot but depend upon himself, and
is necessarily his own concern, in a sense in which it cannot be another's. All
this the Scripture declares in a manner the most forcible and alarming: "Can a
man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him
that thou makest thy ways perfect?" Job xxii, 2, 3. "If thou be wise, thou shalt
be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it," Prov. ix.
12. "He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear,"
Ezek. iii. 27. And again, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear: but if any
man be ignorant, i.e., wilfully, let him be ignorant," 1 Cor. xiv. 38. To the
same purpose are those awful words of the angel, in the person of him to whom
"all judgment is committed," John V. 22; "He that is unjust, let him be unjust
still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous,
let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And,
behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as
his work shall be," Rev. xxii. 11, 12. The righteous government of the world
must be carried on; and of necessity, men shall remain the subjects of it, by
being examples of its mercy or of its justice. "Life and death are set before
them, and whether they like shall be given unto them," Eccl. XV. 17. They are to
make their choice, and abide by it; but whichsoever their choice be, the gospel
is equally a witness to them; and the purposes of Providence are answered by
this witness of the gospel.

From the foregoing view of things, we should be reminded, that the same reasons
which make it our duty to instruct the ignorant in the relation which the light
of nature shows they stand in to God their Maker, and in the obligations of
obedience, resignation, and love to him, which arise out of that relation, make
it our duty likewise to instruct them in all those other relations which
revelation informs us of, and in the obligations of duty which arise out of
them. And the reasons for instructing men in both these, are of the very same
kind as for communicating any useful knowledge whatever. God, if he had so
pleased, could indeed miraculously have revealed every religious truth which
concerns mankind, to every individual man; and so he could have every common
truth; and thus have superseded all use of human teaching in either. Yet, he has
not done this, but has appointed that men should be instructed by the assistance
of their fellow-creatures in both. Further: though all knowledge from reason is
as really from God, as revelation is, yet this last is a distinguished favour to
us, and naturally strikes us with the greatest awe, and carries in it an
assurance that those things which we are informed of by it, are of the utmost
importance to us to be informed of. Revelation, therefore, as it demands to be
received with a regard and reverence peculiar to itself, so it lays us under
obligations, of a like peculiar sort, to communicate the light of it. Further
still: it being an indispensable law of the gospel, that Christians should unite
in religious communities, and these being intended for repositories[1] of the
written "oracles of God," for standing memorials of religion to unthinking men,
and for the propagation of it in the world; Christianity is very particularly to
be considered as a trust deposited with us in behalf of others, in behalf of
mankind, as well as for our own instruction. No one has a right to be called a
Christian, who doth not do somewhat in his station towards the discharge of this
trust; who doth not, for instance, assist in keeping up the profession of
Christianity where he lives. And it is an obligation bat little more remote, to
assist in doing it in our factories abroad; and in the colonies to which we are
related, by their being peopled from our own mother country, and subjects,
indeed very necessary ones, to the same government with ourselves; and nearer
yet is the obligation upon such persons, in particular, as have the interoourse
of an advantageous commerce with them.

Of these our colonies, the slaves ought to be considered as inferior members,
and therefore to be treated as members of them, and not merely as cattle or
goods, the property of their masters. Nor can the highest property possible to
be acquired in these servants, cancel the obligation to take care of their
religious instruction. Despicable as they may appear in our eyes, they are the
creatures of God, and of the race of mankind for whom Christ died: and it is
inexcusable to keep them in ignorance of the end for which they were made, and
the means whereby they may become partakers of the general redemption. On the
contrary, if the necessity of the case requires that they may be treated with
the very utmost rigour that humanity will at all permit, as they certainly are,
and for our advantage made as miserable as they well can be in the present
world; this surely heightens our obligation to put them into as advantageous a
situation as we are able, with regard to another.

The like charity we owe to the natives; owe to them in a much stricter sense
than we are apt to consider, were it only from neighbourhood and our having
gotten possessions in their country. For incidental circumstances of this kind
appropriate all the general obligations of charity to particular persons, and
make such and such instances of it the duty of one man rather than another. We
are most strictly bound to consider these poor uninformed creatures as being in
all respects of one family with ourselves, the family of mankind, and instruct
them in our "common salvation," Jude 3; that they may not pass through this
stage of their being like brute beasts, but be put into a capacity of moral
improvements, how low soever they must remain as to others, and so into a
capacity of qualifying themselves for a higher state of life hereafter.

All our affairs should be carried on in the fear of God, in subserviency to his
honour and the good of mankind. And thus navigation and commerce should be
consecrated to the service of religion, by being made the means of propagating
it in every country with which we have any intercourse. And the more widely we
endeavour to spread its light and influence, as the fore-mentioned
circumstances, and others of the like kind, open and direct our way, the more
faithful shall we be judged in the discharge of that trust[2] which is committed
to us as Christians, when our Lord shall require an account of it.

And it may be some encouragement to cheerful perseverance in these endeavours,
to observe, not only that they are our duty, but also that they seem the means
of carrying on a great scheme of Providence, which shall certainly be
accomplished. For "the everlasting gospel shall be preached to every nation,"
Rev. xiv. 6; "and the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our
Lord, and of his Christ," Rev. xi. 15.

However, we ought not to be discouraged in this good work, though its future
success were less clearly foretold; and though its effect now in reforming
mankind appeared to be as little as our adversaries pretend. They indeed, and
perhaps some others, seem to require more than either experience or Scripture
give ground to hope for, in the present course of the world. But the bare
establishment of Christianity in any place, even the external form and
profession of it, is a very important and valuable effect. It is a serious call
upon men to attend to the natural and the revealed doctrine of religion. It is a
standing publication of the gospel, and renders it a witness to them; and by
this means the purposes of Providence are carrying on, with regard to remote
ages, as well as to the present. "Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt
find it after many days. In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening
withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this
or that, or whether they both shall be alike good," Eccles. xi. 1, 6. We can
look but a very little way into the connections and consequences of things: our
duty is to spread the incorruptible seed as widely as we can; and leave it to
"God to give the increase," 1 Cor. iii. 6. Yet thus much we may be almost
assured of, that the gospel, wherever it is planted, will have its genuine
effect upon some few; upon more, perhaps, than are taken notice of in the hurry
of the world. There are, at least, a few persons in every country and successive
age, scattered up and down, and mixed among the rest of mankind; who, not being
corrupted past amendment, but having within them the principles of recovery,
will be brought to a moral and religious sense of things, by the establishment
of Christianity where they live; and then will be influenced by the peculiar
doctrines of it, in proportion to the integrity of their minds, and to the
clearness, purity, and evidence, with which it is offered them. Of these our
Lord speaks in the parable of the sower, "as understanding the word, and bearing
fruit, and bringing forth, some an hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty," Matt.
xiii. 23. One might add that these persons, in proportion to their influence, do
at present better the state of things; better it even in the civil sense, by
giving some check to that avowed profligateness, which is a contradiction to all
order and government, and, if not checked, must be the subversion of it.

These important purposes, which are certainly to be expected from the good work
before us, may serve to show how little weight there is in that objection
against it, from the want of those miraculous assistances with which the first
preachers of Christianity proved its truth. The plain state of the case is, that
the gospel, though it be not in the same degree a witness to all who have it
made known to them; yet in some degree is so to all. Miracles, to the spectators
of them, are intuitive proofs of its truth: but the bare preaching of it is a
serious admonition to all who hear it, to attend to the notices which God has
given of himself by the light of nature; and, if Christianity be preached with
its proper evidence, to submit to its peculiar discipline and laws: if not, to
inquire honestly after its evidence in proportion to their capacities. And there
are persons of small capacities for inquiry and examination, who yet are wrought
upon by it to "deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world," Tit. ii. 12, 13, in expectation
of a future judgment by Jesus Christ. Nor can any Christian who understands his
religion object that these persons are Christians without evidence; for he
cannot be ignorant who has declared, that "if any man will do his will, he shall
know the doctrine, whether it be of God," John vii. 1 7. And, since the whole
end of Christianity is to influence the heart and actions, were an unbeliever to
object in that manner, he should be asked, whether he would think it to the
purpose to object against persons of like capacities, that they are prudent
without evidence, when, as is often the case, they are observed to manage their
worldly affairs with discretion.

The design before us being therefore in general unexceptionably good, it were
much to be wished, that serious men of all denominations would join in it. And
let me add, that the foregoing view of things affords distinct reasons why they
should. For, first, by so doing, they assist in a work of the most useful
importance, that of spreading over the world the Scripture itself, as a Divine
revelation; and it cannot be spread under this character, for a continuance, in
any country, unless Christian churches be supported there, but will always, more
or less, so long as such churches subsist: and, therefore, their subsistence
ought to be provided for. In the next place, they should remember, that if
Christianity is to be propagated at all, which they acknowledge it should, it
must be in some particular form of profession. And though they think ours liable
to objections, yet it is possible they themselves may be mistaken; and whether
they are or no, the very nature of society requires some compliance with others.
And whilst, together with our particular form of Christianity, the confessed
standard of Christian religion, the Scripture, is spread; and especially whilst
every one is freely allowed to study it, and worship God according to his
conscience; the evident tendency is, that genuine Christianity will be
understood and prevail. Upon the whole, therefore, these persons would do well
to consider how far they can with reason satisfy themselves in neglecting what
is certainly right, on account of what is doubtful whether it be wrong; and when
the right is of so much greater consequence one way, than the supposed wrong can
be on the other.

To conclude: atheistical immorality and profaneness, surely, is not better in
itself, nor less contrary to the design of revelation, than superstition. Nor is
superstition the distinguishing vice of the present age, either at home or
abroad. But if our colonies abroad are left without a public religion, and the
means of instruction, what can be expected, but that from living in a continual
forgetfulness of God, they will at length cease to believe in him, and so sink
into stupid atheism? And there is too apparent danger of the like horrible
depravity at home, without the like excuse for it. Indeed, amongst creatures
naturally formed for religion, yet so much under the powers of imagination, so
apt to deceive themselves, and so liable to be deceived by others, as men are,
superstition is an evil which can never be out of sight. But even against this,
true religion is a great security, and the only one. True religion takes up that
place in the mind which superstition would usurp, and so leaves little room for
it; and likewise lays us under the strongest obligations to oppose it. On the
contrary, the danger of superstition cannot but be increased by the prevalence
of irreligion, and by its general prevalence the evil will be unavoidable. For
the common people wanting a religion, will of course take up with almost any
superstition which is thrown in their way; and, in process of time, amidst the
infinite vicissitudes of the political world, the leaders of parties will
certainly be able to serve themselves of that superstition, whatever it be,
which is getting ground; and will not fail to carry it on to the utmost length
their occasions require. The general nature of the thing shows this, and history
and fact confirm it. But what brings the observation home to ourselves is, that
the great superstition of which this nation, in particular, has reason to be
afraid, is imminent; and the ways in which we may very supposably be overwhelmed
by it, obvious. It is, therefore, wonderful, those people, who seem to think
there is but one evil in life, that of superstition, should not see that atheism
and profaneness must be the introduction of it. So that, in every view of
things, and upon all accounts, irreligion is at present our chief danger. Now
the several religious associations among us, in which many good men have of late
united, appear to be providentially adapted to this present state of the world.
And as all good men are equally concerned in promoting the end of them, to do it
more effectually, they ought to unite in promoting it; which yet is scarce
practicable upon any new models, and quite impossible upon such as every, one
would think unexceptionable. They ought therefore to come into those already
formed to their hands, and even take advantage of any occasion of union, to add
mutual force to each other's endeavours in furthering their common end, however
they may differ as to the best means, or anything else subordinate to it. Indeed
there are well-disposed persons, who much want to be admonished, how dangerous a
thing it is to discountenance what is good, because it is not better, and hinder
what they approve, by raising prejudices against some under part of it. Nor can
they assist in rectifying what they think capable of amendment, in the manner of
carrying on these designs, unless they will join in the designs themselves,
which they must acknowledge to be good and necessary ones. For what can be
called good and necessary by Christians, if it be not so to support Christianity
where it must otherwise sink, and propagate it where it must otherwise be
unknown; to restrain abandoned, bare-faced vice, by making useful examples, at
least of shame, perhaps of repentance; and to take care of the education of such
children as otherwise must be even educated in wickedness, and trained up to
destruction? Yet good men, separately, can do nothing proportionable to what is
wanting in any of these ways; but their common, united endeavours, may do a
great deal in all of them.

And besides the particular purposes which these several religious associations
serve, the more general ones, which they all serve, ought not to be passed over.
Everything of this kind is, in some degree, a safeguard to religion—an obstacle,
more or less, in the way of those who want to have it extirpated out of the
world. Such societies also contribute more especially towards keeping up the
face of Christianity among ourselves; and by their obtaining here, the gospel is
rendered more and more a witness to us. And if it were duly attended to, and had
its genuine influence upon our minds, there would be no need of persuasions to
impart the blessing; nor would the means of doing it be wanted. Indeed, the
present income of this Society, which depends upon voluntary contributions, with
the most frugal management of it, can in no wise sufficiently answer the bare
purposes of our charter; but the nation, or even this opulent city itself, has
it in its power to do so very much more, that I fear the mention of it may be
thought too severe a reproof, since so little is done. But if the gospel had its
proper influence upon the Christian world in general, as it is the centre of
trade and the seat of learning, a very few ages, in all probability, would
settle Christianity in every country, without miraculous assistances. For scarce
anything else, I am persuaded, would be wanting to effect this, but laying it
before men in its divine simplicity, together with an exemplification of it in
the lives of Christian nations. "The unlearned and unbelievers, falling down on
their faces, would worship God, and report that God is in us of a truth," 1 Cor.
xiv.
