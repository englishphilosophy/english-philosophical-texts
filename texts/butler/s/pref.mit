{#1} Though it is scarce possible to avoid judging, in some way or other, of
almost everything which offers itself to one's thoughts, yet it is certain that
many persons, from different causes, never exercise their judgment upon what
comes before them, in the way of determining whether it be conclusive and holds.
They are perhaps entertained with some things, not so with others; they like and
they dislike: but whether that which is proposed to be made out, be really made
out or not; whether a matter be stated according to the real truth of the case,
seems to the generality of people merely a circumstance of no consideration at
all. Arguments are often wanted for some accidental purpose: but proof, as such,
is what they never want for themselves; for their own satisfaction of mind, or
conduct in life. Not to mention the multitudes who read merely for the sake of
talking, or to qualify themselves for the world, or some such kind of reasons;
there are, even of the few who read for their own entertainment, and have a real
curiosity to see what is said, several (which is prodigious) who have no sort of
curiosity to see what is true: I say, curiosity; because it is too obvious to be
mentioned, how much that religious and sacred attention, which is due to truth,
and to the important question, What is the rule of life? is lost out of the
world.

{#2} For the sake of this whole class of readers, for they are of different
capacities, different kinds, and get into this way from different occasions, I
have often wished that it had been the custom to lay before people nothing in
matters of argument but premises, and leave them to draw conclusions themselves;
which, though it could not be done in all cases, might in many.

{#3} The great number of books and papers of amusement, which, of one kind or
another, daily come in one's way, have in part occasioned, and most perfectly
fall in with and humour this idle way of reading and considering things. By this
means, time, even in solitude, is happily got rid of, without the pain of
attention: neither is any part of it more put to the account of idleness, one
can scarce forbear saying, is spent with less thought, than great part of that
which is spent in reading.

{#4} Thus people habituate themselves to let things pass through their minds, as
one may speak, rather than to think of them. Thus, by use, they become satisfied
merely with seeing what is said, without going any further. Review and
attention, and even forming a judgment, become fatigue; and to lay anything
before them that requires it, is putting them quite out of the way.

{#5} There are also persons, and there are at least more of them than have a
right to claim such superiority, who take for granted, that they are acquainted
with everything; and that no subject, if treated in the manner it should be, can
be treated in any manner but what is familiar and easy to them.

{#6} It is true, indeed, that few persons have a right to demand attention; but
it is also true, that nothing can be understood without that degree of it, which
the very nature of the thing requires. Now morals, considered as a science,
concerning which speculative difficulties are daily raised, and treated with
regard to those difficulties, plainly require a very peculiar attention. For
here ideas never are in themselves determinate, but become so by the train of
reasoning and the place they stand in; since it is impossible that words can
always stand for the same ideas, even in the same author, much less in different
ones. Hence an argument may not readily be apprehended, which is different from
its being mistaken; and even caution to avoid being mistaken, may, in some
cases, render it less readily apprehended. It is very unallowable for a work of
imagination or entertainment not to be of easy comprehension, but may be
unavoidable in a work of another kind, where a man is not to form or
accommodate, but to state things as he finds them.

{#7} It must be acknowledged that some of the following Discourses are very
abstruse and difficult; or, if you please, obscure: But I must take Leave to
add, that those alone are Judges, whether or no and how far this is a fault, who are Judges,
whether or no and how far it might have been avoided—those only who will be at
the Trouble to understand what is here said, and to see how far the Things here
insisted upon, and not other Things, might have been put in a plainer Manner;
which yet I am very far from asserting that they could not.

{#8} Thus much however will be allowed, that general criticisms concerning
obscurity, considered as a distinct thing from confusion and perplexity of
thought, as in some cases there may be ground for them, so, in others, they may
be nothing more at the bottom than complaints, that everything is not to be
understood with the same ease that some things are. Confusion and perplexity in
writing is indeed without excuse, because any one may, if he pleases, know
whether he understands and sees through what he is about; and it is unpardonable
for a man to lay his thoughts before others, when he is conscious that he
himself does not know whereabouts he is, or how the matter before him stands. It
is coming abroad in a disorder, which he ought to be dissatisfied to find
himself in at home.

{#9} But even obscurities, arising from other causes than the abstruseness of
the argument, may not be always inexcusable. Thus, a subject may be treated in a
manner which all along supposes the reader acquainted with what has been said
upon it, both by ancient and modern writers; and with what is the present state
of opinion in the world concerning such subject. This will create a difficulty
of a very peculiar kind, and even throw an obscurity over the whole, before
those who are not thus informed; but those who are, will be disposed to excuse
such a manner, and other things of the like kind, as a saving of their patience.

{#10} However, upon the whole, as the title of Sermons gives some right to
expect what is plain and of easy comprehension, and as the best auditories are
mixed, I shall not set about to justify the propriety of preaching, or under
that title publishing, discourses so abstruse as some of these are. Neither is
it worth while to trouble the reader with the account of my doing either. He
must not, however, impute to me, as a repetition of the impropriety, this second
edition,[n1] but to the demand for it.

{#11} Whether he will think he has any amends made him, by the following
illustrations of what seemed most to require them, I myself am by no means a
proper judge.

{#12} There are two ways in which the subject of morals may be treated. One
begins from inquiring into the abstract relations of things; the other, from a
matter of fact, namely, what the particular nature of man is, its several parts,
their economy or constitution; from whence it proceeds to determine what course
of life it is, which is correspondent to this whole nature. In the former method
the conclusion is expressed thus, that vice is contrary to the nature and
reasons of things; in the latter, that it is a violation or breaking in upon our
own nature. Thus they both lead us to the same thing, our obligations to the
practice of virtue; and thus they exceedingly strengthen and enforce each other.
The first seems the most direct formal proof, and in some respects the least
liable to cavil and dispute: the latter is in a peculiar manner adapted to
satisfy a fair mind, and is more easily applicable to the several particular
relations and circumstances in life.

{#13} The following discourses proceed chiefly in this latter method. The first
three wholly. They were intended to explain what is meant by the nature of man,
when it is said that virtue consists in following, and vice in deviating from
it; and, by explaining, to show that the assertion is true. That the ancient
moralists had some inward feeling or other, which they chose to express in this
manner, that man is born to virtue, that it consists in following nature, and
that vice is more contrary to this nature than tortures or death, their works in
our hands are instances. Now, a person who found no mystery in this way of
speaking of the ancients; who, without being very explicit with himself, kept to
this natural feeling, went along with them, and found within himself a full
conviction that what they laid down was just and true; such an one would
probably wonder to see a point, in which he never perceived any difficulty, so
laboured as this is, in the second and third sermons; insomuch, perhaps, as to
be at a loss for the occasion, scope, and drift of them. But it need not be
thought strange, that this manner of expression, though familiar with them, and
if not usually carried so far, yet not uncommon amongst ourselves, should want
explaining; since there are several perceptions daily felt and spoken of, which
yet it may not be very easy at first view to explicate, to distingnish from all
others, and ascertain exactly what the idea or perception is. The many treatises
upon the passions are a proof of this; since so many would never have undertaken
to unfold their several complications, and trace and resolve them into their
principles, if they had thought, what they were endeavouring to show was obvious
to every one who felt and talked of those passions. Thus though there seems no
ground to doubt, but that the generality of mankind have the inward perception
expressed so commonly in that manner by the ancient moralists, more than to
doubt whether they have those passions, yet it appeared of use to unfold that
inward conviction, and lay it open in a more explicit manner than I had seen
done; especially when there were not wanting persons, who manifestly mistook the
whole thing, and so had great reason to express themselves dissatisfied with it.
A late author, of great and deserved reputation, says, that to place virtue in
following nature is, at best, a loose way of talk. And he has reason to say
this, if what I think he intends to express, though with great decency, be true,
that scarce any other sense can be put upon those words, but acting as any of
the several parts, without distinction, of a man's nature, happened most to
incline him.[n2]

{#14} Whoever thinks it worth while to consider this matter thoroughly, should
begin with stating to himself exactly the idea of a system, economy, or
constitution, of any particular nature, or particular anything; and he will, I
suppose, find, that it is an one or a whole, made up of several parts; but yet
that the several parts, even considered as a whole, do not complete the idea,
unless in the notion of a whole you include the relations and respects which
those parts have to each other. Every work, both of nature and of art, is a
system: and as every particular thing, both natural and artificial, is for some
use or purpose out of and beyond itself, one may add to what has been already
brought into the idea of a system, its conduciveness to this one or more ends.
Let us instance in a watch: Suppose the several parts of it taken to pieces, and
placed apart from each other; let a man have ever so exact a notion of these
several parts, unless he considers the respect and relations which they have to
each other, he will not have anything like the idea of a watch. Suppose these
several parts brought together and any how united: neither will he yet, be the
union ever so close, have an idea which will bear any resemblance to that of a
watch. But let him view those several parts put together, or consider them as to
be put together in the manner of a watch; let him form a notion of the relations
which those several parts have to each other—all conducive, in their respective
ways, to this purpose, showing the hour of the day; and then he has the idea of
a watch. Thus it is with regard to the inward frame of man. Appetites, passions,
affections, and the principle of affection, considered merely as the several
parts of our inward nature, do not at all give us an idea of the system or
constitution of this nature: because the constitution is formed by somewhat not
yet taken into consideration, namely, by the relations which these several parts
have to each other; the chief of which is the authority of reflection or
conscience. It is from considering the relations which the several appetites and
passions in the inward frame have to each other, and, above all, the supremacy
of reflection or conscience, that we get the idea of the system or constitution
of human nature. And from the idea itself it will as fully appear, that this our
nature, i.e., constitution, is adapted to virtue, as from the idea of a watch it
appears, that its nature, i.e., constitution or system, is adapted to measure
time. What in fact or event commonly happens, is nothing to this question. Every
work of art is apt to be out of order; but this is so far from being according
to its system, that let the disorder increase, and it will totally destroy it.
This is merely by way of explanation, what an economy, system, or constitution
is. And thus far the cases are perfectly parallel. If we go further, there is
indeed a difference, nothing to the present purpose, but too important an one
ever to be omitted. A machine is inanimate and passive: but we are agents. Our
constitution is put in our power; we are charged with it, and therefore are
accountable for any disorder or violation of it.

{#15} Thus nothing can possibly be more contrary to nature than vice; meaning by
nature, not only the several parts of our internal frame, but also the
constitution of it. Poverty and disgrace, tortures and death, are not so
contrary to it. Misery and injustice are indeed equally contrary to some
different parts of our nature, taken singly: but injustice is moreover contrary
to the whole constitution of the nature.

{#16} If it be asked, whether this constitution be really what those
philosophers meant, and whether they would have explained themselves in this
manner, the answer is the same as if it should be asked, whether a person, who
had often used the word resentment, and felt the thing, would have explained
this passion exactly in the same manner in which it is done in one of these
discourses. As I have no doubt but that this is a true account of that passion,
which he referred to and intended to express by the word resentment, so I have
no doubt, but that this is the true account of the ground of that conviction
which they referred to, when they said vice was contrary to nature. And though
it should be thought that they meant no more than that vice was contrary to the
higher and better part of our nature, even this implies such a constitution as I
have endeavoured to explain. For the very terms, higher and better, imply a
relation or respect of parts to each other; and these relative parts, being in
one and the same nature, form a constitution, and are the very idea of it. They
had a perception that injustice was contrary to their nature, and that pain was
so also. They observed these two perceptions totally different, not in degree,
but in kind; and the reflecting upon each of them, as they thus stood in their
nature, wrought a full intuitive conviction, that more was due, and of right
belonging to one of these inward perceptions, than to the other; that it
demanded in all cases to govern such a creature as man. So that, upon the whole,
this is a fair and true account of what was the ground of their conviction; of
what they intended to refer to when they said, virtue consisted in following
nature—a manner of speaking, not loose and undeterminate, but clear and
distinct, strictly just and true.

{#17} Though I am persuaded the force of this conviction is felt by almost every
one, yet since, considered as an argument and put in words, it appears somewhat
abstruse, and since the connection of it is broken in the first three sermons,
it may not be amiss to give the reader the whole argument here in one view.

{#18} Mankind has various instincts and principles of action, as brute creatures
have; some leading most directly and immediately to the good of the community,
and some most directly to private good.

{#19} Man has several which brutes have not, particularly reflection or
conscience, an approbation of some principles or actions, and disapprobation of
others.

{#20} Brutes obey their instincts or principles of action, according to certain
rules; suppose the constitution of their body, and the objects around them.

{#21} The generality of mankind also obey their instincts and principles, all of
them; those propensions we call good, as well as the bad, according to the same
rules—namely, the constitution of their body, and the external circumstances
which they are in. \[Therefore it is not a true representation of mankind, to
affirm that they are wholly governed by self-love, the love of power and sensual
appetites: since, as on the one band, they are often actuated by these, without
any regard to right or wrong; so on the other, it is manifest fact, that the
same persons, the generality are frequently influenced by friendship,
compassion, gratitude, and even a general abhorrence of what is base, and liking
of what is fair and just, takes its turn amongst the other motives of action.
This is the partial inadequate notion of human nature treated of in the first
discourse; and it is by this nature, if one may speak so, that the world is in
fact influenced, and kept in that tolerable order in which it is.\]

{#22} Brutes, in acting according to the rules before mentioned, their bodily
constitution and circumstances, act suitably to their whole nature. \[It is
however to be distinctly noted, that the reason why we affirm this, is not
merely that brutes in fact act so; for this alone, however universal, does not
at all determine whether such course of action be correspondent to their whole
nature. But the reason of the assertion is, that as, in acting thus, they
plainly act conformably to somewhat in their nature, so, from all observations
we are able to make upon them, there does not appear the least ground to imagine
them to have anything else in their nature, which requires a different rule or
course of action.\]

{#23} Mankind also, in acting thus, would act suitably to their whole nature, if
no more were to be said of man's nature than what has been now said; if that, as
it is a true, were also a complete, adequate account of our nature.

{#24} But that is not a complete account of man's nature. Somewhat further must
be brought in to give us an adequate notion of it—namely, that one of those
principles of action, conscience, or reflection, compared with the rest, as they
all stand together in the nature of man, plainly bears upon it marks of
authority over all the rest, and claims the absolute direction of them all, to
allow or forbid their gratification; a disapprobation of reflection being in
itself a principle manifestly superior to a mere propension. And the conclusion
is, that to allow no more to this superior principle or part of our nature, than
to other parts; to let it govern and guide only occasionally in common with the
rest, as its turn happens to come, from the temper and circumstances one happens
to be in; this is not to act conformably to the constitution of man. Neither can
any human creature be said to act conformably to his constitution of nature,
unless he allows to that superior principle the absolute authority which is due
to it. And this conclusion is abundantly confirmed from hence, that one may
determine what course of action the economy of man's nature requires, without so
much as knowing in what degrees of strength the several principles prevail, or
which of them have actually the greatest influence.

{#25} The practical reason of insisting so much upon this natural authority of
the principle of reflection or conscience is, that it seems in a great measure
overlooked by many, who are by no means the worst sort of men. It is thought
sufficient to abstain from gross wickedness, and to be humane and kind to such
as happen to come in their way. Whereas, in reality, the very constitution of
our nature requires, that we bring our whole conduct before this superior
faculty; wait its determination; enforce upon ourselves its authority; and make
it the business of our lives as it is absolutely the whole business of a moral
agent, to conform ourselves to it. This is the true meaning of that ancient
precept, Reverence thyself.

{#26} The not taking into consideration the authority, which is implied in the
idea of reflex approbation or disapprobation, seems a material deficiency or
omission in Lord Shaftesbury's Inquiry concerning Virtue. He has shown, beyond
all contradiction, that virtue is naturally the interest or happiness, and vice
the misery of such a creature as man, placed in the circumstances which we are
in this world. But suppose there are particular exceptions; a case which this
author was unwilling to put, and yet surely it is to be put. Or suppose a case
which he has put and determined, that of a sceptic not convinced of this happy
tendency of virtue, or being of a contrary opinion: his determination is, that
it would be without remedy.[n3] One may say more explicitly, that, leaving out
the authority of reflex approbation or disapprobation, such an one would be
under an obligation to act viciously; since interest, one's own happiness, is a
manifest obligation, and there is not supposed to be any other obligation in the
case. "But does it much mend the matter, to take in that natural authority of
reflection? There indeed would be an obligation to virtue; but would not the
obligation from supposed interest on the side of vice remain?" If it should, yet
to be under two contrary obligations, i.e., under none at all, would not be
exactly the same as to be under a formal obligation to be vicious, or to be in
circumstances in which the constitution of man's nature plainly required that
vice should be preferred. But the obligation on the side of interest really does
not remain. For the natural authority of the principle of reflection, is an
obligation the most near and intimate, the most certain and known; whereas the
contrary obligation can at the utmost appear no more than probable; since no man
can be certain, in any circumstances, that vice is his interest in the present
world, much less can he be certain against another. And thus the certain
obligation would entirely supersede and destroy the uncertain one; which yet
would have been of real force without the former.

{#27} In truth, the taking in this consideration totally changes the whole state
of the case, and shows, what this author does not seem to have been aware of,
that the greatest degree of scepticism which he thought possible, will still
leave men under the strictest moral obligations, whatever their opinion be
concerning the happiness of virtue. For that mankind, upon reflection, felt an
approbation of what was good, and disapprobation of the contrary, he thought a
plain matter of fact, as it undoubtedly is, which none could deny, but from mere
affectation. Take in, then, that authority and obligation, which is a
constituent part of this reflex approbation, and it will undeniably follow,
though a man should doubt of everything else, yet that he would still remain
under the nearest and most certain obligation to the practice of virtue; an
obligation implied in the very idea of virtue, in the very idea of reflex
approbation.

{#28} And how little influence soever this obligation alone can be expected to
have, in fact, upon mankind, yet one may appeal even to interest and self-love,
and ask, since from man's nature, condition, and the shortness of life, so
little, so very little, indeed, can possibly in any case be gained by vice,
whether it be so prodigious a thing to sacrifice that little to the most
intimate of all obligations; and which a man cannot transgress without being
self-condemned, and, unless he has corrupted his nature, without real
self-dislike? This question, I say, may be asked, even upon suspicion that the
prospect of a future life were ever so uncertain.

{#29} The observation that man is thus, by his very nature, a law to himself,
pursued to its just consequences, is of the utmost importance; because from it
will follow, that though men should, through stupidity, or speculative
scepticism, be ignorant of, or disbelieve, any authority in the universe to
punish the violation of this law; yet, if there should be such authority, they
would be as really liable to punishment, as though they had been beforehand
convinced that such punishment would follow. For, in whatever sense we
understand justice, even supposing, what I think would be very presumptuous to
assert, that the end of divine punishment is no other than that of civil
punishment—namely, to prevent further mischief; upon this bold supposition,
ignorance or disbelief of the sanction would by no means exempt even from this
injustice; because it is not foreknowledge of the punishment which renders
obnoxious to it, but merely violating a known obligation.

{#30} And here it comes in one's way to take notice of a manifest error, or
mistake, in the author now cited, unless, perhaps, he has incautiously expressed
himself so as to be misunderstood—namely, that "it is malice only, and not
goodness, which can make us afraid."[n4] Whereas, in reality, goodness is the
natural and just object of the greatest fear to an ill man. Malice may be
appeased or satiated; humour may change; but goodness is a fixed, steady,
immovable principle of action. If either of the former holds the sword of
justice, there is plainly ground for the greatest of crimes to hope for
impunity; but if it be goodness, there can be no possible hope, whilst the
reason of things, or the ends of government, call for punishment. Thus, every
one sees how much greater chance of impunity an ill man has, in a partial
administration, than in a just and upright one. It is said, that "the interest
or good of the whole, must be the interest of the universal Being, and that He
can have no other." Be it so. This author has proved, that vice is naturally the
misery of mankind in this world. Consequently, it was for the good of the whole,
that it should be so. What shadow of reason, then, is there to assert, that this
may not be the case hereafter? Danger of future punishments (and if there be
danger, there is ground of fear) no more supposes malice than the present
feeling of punishment does.

{#31} The sermon upon the character of Balaam and that upon self-deceit both
relate to one subject. I am persuaded that a very great part of the wickedness
of the world is, one way or other, owing to the self-partiality, self-flattery,
and self-deceit endeavoured there to be laid open and explained. It is to be
observed amongst persons of the lowest rank, in proportion to their compass of
thought, as much as amongst men of education and improvement. It seems that
people are capable of being thus artful with themselves, in proportion as they
are capable of being so with others. Those who have taken notice that there is
really such a thing—namely, plain falseness and insincerity in men, with regard
to themselves, will readily see the drift and design of these discourses: and
nothing that I can add will explain the design of them to him, who has not
beforehand remarked at least somewhat of the character. And yet the admonitions
they contain may be as much wanted by such a person as by others: for it is to
be noted, that a man may be entirely possessed by this unfairness of mind,
without having the least speculative notion what the thing is.

{#32} The account given of resentment, in the eighth sermon, is introductory to
the following one, upon forgiveness of injuries. It may possibly have appeared
to some, at first sight, a strange assertion, that injury is the only natural
object of settled resentment; or that men do not, in fact, resent deliberately
anything but under this appearance of injury. But I must desire the reader not
to take any assertion alone by itself, but to consider the whole of what is said
upon it: because this is necessary, not only in order to judge of the truth of
it, but often, such is the nature of language, to see the very meaning of the
assertion. Particularly as to this, injury and injustice is, in the sermon
itself, explained to mean, not only the more gross and shocking instances of
wickedness, but also contempt, scorn, neglect, any sort of disagreeable
behaviour towards a person, which he thinks other than what is due to him. And
the general notion of injury, or wrong, plainly comprehends this, though the
words are mostly confined to the higher degrees of it.

{#33} Forgiveness of injuries is one of the very few moral obligations which has
been disputed. But the proof that it is really an obligation, what our nature
and condition require, seems very obvious, were it only from the consideration,
that revenge is doing harm merely for harm's sake. And as to the love of our
enemies: resentment cannot supersede the obligations to universal benevolence,
unless they are in the nature of the thing inconsistent, which they plainly are
not.

{#34} This divine precept, to forgive injuries and love our enemies, though to
be met with in Gentile moralists, yet is in a peculiar sense a precept of
Christianity; as our Saviour has insisted more upon it than upon any other
single virtue. One reason of this doubtless is, that it so peculiarly becomes an
imperfect faulty creature. But it may be observed also, that a virtuous temper
of mind, consciousness of innocence, and good meaning towards everybody, and a
strong feeling of injustice and injury, may, itself, such is the imperfection of
our virtue, lead a person to violate this obligation, if he be not upon his
guard. And it maybe well supposed, that this is another reason why it is so much
insisted upon by him, who knew what was in man.

{#35} The chief design of the eleventh discourse, is to state the notion of
self-love and disinterestedness, in order to show that benevolence is not more
unfriendly to self-love than any other particular affection whatever. There is a
strange affectation in many people in explaining away all particular affections,
and representing the whole of life as nothing but one continued exercise of
self-love. Hence arises that surprising confusion and perplexity in the
Epicureans[n5] of old, Hobbs, the author of Reflections, Sentences, et Maximes
Morales, and this whole set of writers; the confusion of calling actions
interested, which are done in contradiction to the most manifest known interest,
merely for the gratification of a present passion. Now, all this confusion might
easily be avoided, by stating to ourselves wherein the idea of self-love in
general consists, as distinguished from all particular movements towards
particular external objects; the appetites of sense, resentment, compassion,
curiosity, ambition, and the rest. When this is done, if the words selfish and
interested cannot be parted with, but must be applied to everything; yet, to
avoid such total confusion of all language, let the distinction be made by
epithets; and the first may be called cool, or settled selfishness, and the
other passionate or sensual selfishness. But the most natural way of speaking
plainly is, to call the first only, self-love, and the actions proceeding from
it interested; and to say of the latter, that they are not love to ourselves,
but movements towards somewhat external,—honour, power, the harm or good of
another. And that the pursuit of these external objects, so far as it proceeds
from these movements, (for it may proceed from self-love,) is no otherwise
interested, than as every action of every creature must, from the nature of the
thing, be; for no one can act but from a desire, or choice, or preference of his
own.

{#36} Self-love and any particular passion may be joined together; and from this
complication, it becomes impossible, in numberless instances, to determine
precisely how far an action, perhaps even of one's own, has for its principle
general self-love or some particular passion. But this need create no confusion
in the ideas themselves of self-love and particular passions. We distinctly
discern what one is, and what the other are; though we may be uncertain how far
one or the other influences us. And though, from this uncertainty, it cannot but
be, that there will be different opinions concerning mankind, as more or less
governed by interest; and some will ascribe actions to self-love, which others
will ascribe to particular passions, yet it is absurd to say, that mankind are
wholly actuated by either; since it is manifest that both have their influence.
For as, on the one hand, men form a general notion of interest, some placing it
in one thing, and some in another, and have a considerable regard to it
throughout the course of their life, which is owing to self-love; so, on the
other hand, they are often set on work by the particular passions themselves,
and a considerable part of life is spent in the actual gratification of them;
i.e., is employed, not by self-love, but by the passions.

{#37} Besides, the very idea of an interested pursuit, necessarily presupposes
particular passions or appetites; since the very idea of interest, or happiness,
consists in this, that an appetite, or affection, enjoys its object. It is not
because we love ourselves that we find delight in such and such objects, but
because we have particular affections towards them. Take away these affections,
and you leave self-love absolutely nothing at all to employ itself about; no
end, or object, for it to pursue, excepting only that of avoiding pain. Indeed,
the Epicureans, who maintained that absence of pain was the highest happiness,
might, consistently with themselves, deny all affection, and, if they had so
pleased, every sensual appetite too: but the very idea of interest, or
happiness, other than absence of pain, implies particular appetites or passions;
these being necessary to constitute that interest or happiness.

{#38} The observation, that benevolence is no more disinterested than any of the
common particular passions, seems in itself worth being taken notice of; but is
insisted upon to obviate that scorn, which one sees rising upon the faces of
people, who are said to know the world, when mention is made of a disinterested,
generous, or public-spirited action. The truth of that observation might be made
appear in a more formal manner of proof: for whoever will consider all the
possible respects and relations which any particular affection can have to
self-love and private interest, will, I think, see demonstrably, that
benevolence is not in any respect more at variance with self-love, than any
other particular affection whatever, but that it is, in every respect, at least
as friendly to it.

{#39} If the observation be true, it follows, that self-love and benevolence,
virtue and interest, are not to be opposed, but only to be distinguished from
each other; in the same way as virtue and any other particular affection, love
of arts, suppose, are to be distinguished. Everything is what it is, and not
another thing. The goodness, or badness of actions, does not arise from hence,
that the epithet, interested, or disinterested, may be applied to them, any more
than that any other indifferent epithet, suppose inquisitive or jealous, may, or
may not, be applied to them; not from their being attended with present or
future pleasure or pain, but from their being what they are: namely, what
becomes such creatures as we are, what the state of the case requires, or the
contrary. Or, in other words, we may judge and determine that an action is
morally good or evil, before we so much as consider, whether it be interested or
disinterested. This consideration no more comes in to determine, whether an
action be virtuous, than to determine whether it be resentful. Self-love, in its
due degree, is as just and morally good as any affection whatever. Benevolence
towards particular persons may be to a degree of weakness, and so be blamable.
And disinterestedness is so far from being in itself commendable, that the
utmost possible depravity, which we can in imagination conceive, is that of
disinterested cruelty.

{#40} Neither does there appear any reason to wish self-love were weaker in the
generality of the world than it is.—The influence which it has, seems plainly
owing to its being constant and habitual, which it cannot but be, and not to the
degree or strength of it. Every caprice of the imagination, every curiosity of
the understanding, every affection of the heart, is perpetually showing its
weakness, by prevailing over it. Men daily, hourly, sacrifice the greatest known
interest to fancy, inquisitiveness, love or hatred, any vagrant inclination. The
thing to be lamented is, not that men have so great regard to their own good or
interest in the present world, for they have not enough; but that they have so
little to the good of others. And this seems plainly owing to their being so
much engaged in the gratification of particular passions unfriendly to
benevolence, and which happen to be most prevalent in them, much more than to
self-love. As a proof of this it may be observed, that there is no character
more void of friendship, gratitude, natural affection, love to their country,
common justice, or more equally and uniformly hard-hearted, than the abandoned
in, what is called, the way of pleasure—hard-hearted and totally without feeling
in behalf of others; except when they cannot escape the sight of distress, and
so are interrupted by it in their pleasures. And yet it is ridiculous to call
such an abandoned course of pleasure interested, when the person engaged in it
knows beforehand, and goes on under the feeling and apprehension, that it will
be as ruinous to himself, as to those who depend upon him.

{#41} Upon the whole, if the generality of mankind were to cultivate within
themselves the principle of self-love; if they were to accustom themselves often
to set down and consider, what was the greatest happiness they were capable of
attaining for themselves in this life; and if self-love were so strong and
prevalent, as that they would uniformly pursue this their supposed chief
temporal good, without being diverted from it by any particular passion, it
would manifestly prevent numberless follies and vices. This was in a great
measure the Epicurean system of philosophy. It is indeed by no means the
religious, or even moral institution of life. Yet with all the mistakes men
would fall into about interest, it would be less mischievous than the
extravagances of mere appetite, will, and pleasure: for certainly self-love,
though confined to the interest of this life, is, of the two, a much better
guide than passion, which has absolutely no bound nor measure, but what is set
to it by this self-love, or moral considerations.

{#42} From the distinction above made, between self-love and the several
particular principles or affections in our nature, we may see how good ground
there was for that assertion, maintained by the several ancient schools of
philosophy against the Epicureans, namely, that virtue is to be pursued as an
end, eligible in and for itself. For, if there be any principles or affections
in the mind of man distinct from self-love, that the things those principles
tend towards, or that the objects of those affections are, each of them, in
themselves eligible to be pursued upon its own account, and to be rested in as
an end, is implied in the very idea of such principle or affection. They indeed
asserted much higher things of virtue, and with very good reason: but to say
thus much of it, that it is to be pursued for itself, is to say no more of it
than may truly be said of the object of every natural affection whatever.

{#43} The question which was a few years ago disputed in France, concerning the
love of God, which was there called enthusiasm, as it will every where by the
generality of the world; this question, I say, answers in religion, to that old
one in ’'morals now mentioned. And both of them are, I think, fully determined
by the same observation, namely, that the very nature of affection, the idea
itself, necessarily implies resting in its object as an end.

{#44} I shall not here add anything further to what I have said in the two
discourses upon that most important subject, but only this, that if we are
constituted such sort of creatures, as, from our very nature, to feel certain
affections or movements of mind, upon the sight or contemplation or the meanest
inanimate part of the creation, for the flowers of the field have their beauty;
certainly there must be somewhat due to him himself, who is the Author and Cause
of all things; who is more intimately present to as than anything else can be;
and with whom we have a nearer and more constant intercourse, than we can have
with any creature: there must be some movements of mind and heart which
correspond to his perfections, or of which those perfections are the natural
object. And that when we are commanded to love the Lord our God, with all our
heart, and with all our mind, and with all our soul, somewhat more must be meant
than merely that we live in hope of rewards, or fear of punishments from him;
somewhat more than this must be intended; though these regards themselves are
most just and reasonable, and absolutely necessary to be often recollected, in
such a world as this.

{#45} It may be proper just to advertise the reader, that he is not to look for
any particular reason for the choice of the greatest part of these discourses;
their being taken from amongst many others, preached in the same place, through
a course of eight years, being in great measure accidental. Neither is he to
expect to find any other connexion between them, than that uniformity of thought
and design, which will always be found in the writings of the same person, when
he writes with simplicity and in earnest. //

{#n5} One need only look into Torquatus's account of the Epicurean system in
Cicero's first book [De Finibus], to see in what a surprising manner this was
done by them. Thus, the desire of praise, and of being beloved, he explains to
be no other than desire of safety; regard to our country, even in the most
virtuous character, to be nothing but regard to ourselves. The author of
Reflections, &c., Morales, says, "Curiosity proceeds from interest, or pride;
which pride also would doubtless have been explained to be self-love;" [Pag. 85,
Ed. 1723]. As if there were no passions in mankind, as desire of esteem, or of
being beloved, or of knowledge. Hobbs's account of the affections of good will
and pity, are instances of the same kind.
