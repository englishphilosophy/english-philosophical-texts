£2 OUR INCAPACITY OF JUDGING, WHAT WERE TO BE EXPECTED IN A REVELATION; AND THE
CREDIBILITY, FROM ANALOGY, THAT IT MUST CONTAIN THINGS LIABLE TO OBJECTIONS. £2

{#1} Besides the objections against the _evidence_ for Christianity, many are
alleged against the _scheme_ of it; against the whole manner in which it is put
and left with the world; as well as against several particular relations in
Scripture: objections drawn from the deficiencies of revelation: from things in
it appearing to men _foolishness_;[n97] from its containing matters of offence,
which have led, and it must have been foreseen would lead, into strange
enthusiasm and superstition, and be made to serve the purposes of tyranny and
wickedness; from its not being universal; and, which is a thing of the same
kind, from its evidence not being so convincing and satisfactory as it might
have been: for this last is sometimes turned into a positive argument against
its truth.[n98]

{#2} It would be tedious, indeed impossible, to enumerate the several
particulars comprehended under the objections here referred to; they being so
various, according to the different fancies of men. There are persons who think
it a strong objection against the authority of Scripture, that it is not
composed by rules of art, agreed upon by critics, for polite and correct
writing. And the scorn is inexpressible, with which some of the prophetic parts
of Scripture are treated: partly through the rashness of interpreters; but very
much also, on account of the hieroglyphical and figurative language, in which
they are left us.

{#3} Some of the principal things of this sort shall be particularly considered
in the following chapters. But my design at present is to observe in general,
with respect to this whole way of arguing, that, upon supposition of a
revelation, it is highly credible beforehand, that we should be incompetent
judges of it to a great degree: and that it would contain many things appearing
to us liable to great objections; in case we judge of it otherwise, than by the
analogy of nature. Therefore, though objections against the _evidence_ of
Christianity are most seriously to be considered, yet objections against
Christianity itself are, in a great measure, frivolous: almost all objections
against it, excepting those which are alleged against the particular proofs of
its coming from God. I express myself with caution, lest I should be mistaken to
vilify reason; which is indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to judge
concerning any thing, even revelation itself: or be misunderstood to assert,
that a supposed revelation cannot be proved false, from internal characters.
For, it may contain clear immoralities or contradictions; and either of these
would prove it false. Nor will I take upon me to affirm, that nothing else can
possibly render any supposed revelation incredible. Yet still the observation
above, is, I think, true beyond doubt; that objections against Christianity, as
distinguished from objections against its evidence, are frivolous. To make out
this, is the general design of the present chapter.

{#4} With regard to the whole of it, I cannot but particularly wish, that the
_proofs_ might be attended to; rather than the assertions cavilled at, upon
account of any unacceptable _consequences_, real or supposed, which may be drawn
from them. For, after all, that which is true, must be admitted, though it
should show us the shortness of our faculties: and that we are in no wise judges
of many things, of which we are apt to think ourselves very competent ones. Nor
will this be any objection with reasonable men; at least upon second thought it
will not be any objection with such, against the justness of the following
observations.

{#5} As God governs the world and instructs his creatures, according to certain
laws or rules, in the known course of nature; known by reason together with
experience: so the Scripture informs us of a scheme of divine Providence,
additional to this. It relates, that God has, by revelation, instructed men in
things concerning his government, which they could not otherwise have known; and
reminded them of things, which they might otherwise know; and attested the truth
of the whole by miracles. Now if the natural and the revealed dispensation of
things are both from God, if they coincide with each other, and together make up
one scheme of Providence; our being incompetent judges of one, must render it
credible, that we may be incompetent judges also of the other. Upon experience,
the acknowledged constitution and course of nature is found to be greatly
different from what, before experience, would have been expected; and such as,
men fancy, there lie great objections against. This renders it beforehand highly
credible, that they may find the revealed dispensation likewise, if they judge
of it as they do of the constitution of nature, very different from expectations
formed beforehand; and liable, in appearance, to great objections: objections
against the scheme itself, and against the degrees and manners of the miraculous
interpositions by which it was attested and carried on. Thus, suppose a prince
to govern his dominions in the wisest manner possible, by common known laws; and
that upon some exigencies he should suspend these laws; and govern, in several
instances, in a different manner. If one of his subjects were not a competent
judge beforehand, by what common rules the government should or would be carried
on; it could not be expected, that the same person would be a competent judge,
in what exigencies, or in what manner, or to what degree, those laws commonly
observed would be suspended or deviated from. If he were not a judge of the
wisdom of the ordinary administration, there is no reason to think he would be a
judge of the wisdom of the extraordinary. If he thought he had objections
against the former; doubtless, it is highly supposable, he might think also,
that he had objections against the latter. And thus, as we fall into infinite
follies and mistakes, whenever we pretend, otherwise than from experience and
analogy, to judge of the constitution and course of nature; it is evidently
supposable beforehand, that we should fall into as great, in pretending to judge
in like manner concerning revelation. Nor is there any more ground to expect
that this latter should appear to us clear of objections, than that the former
should.

{#6} These observations, relating to the whole of Christianity, are applicable
to inspiration in particular. As we are in no sort judges beforehand, by what
laws or rules, in what degree, or by what means, it were to have been expected,
that God would naturally instruct us; so upon supposition of his affording us
light and instruction by revelation, additional to what he has afforded us by
reason and experience, we are in no sort judges, by what methods, and in what
proportion, it were to be expected that this supernatural light and instruction
would be afforded us. We know not beforehand, what degree or kind of natural
information it were to be expected God would afford men, each by his own reason
and experience: nor how far he would enable and effectually dispose them to
communicate it, whatever it should be, to each other; nor whether the evidence
of it would be certain, highly probable, or doubtful; nor whether it would be
given with equal clearness and conviction to all. Nor could we guess, upon any
good ground I mean, whether natural knowledge, or even the faculty itself, by
which we are capable of attaining it, reason, would be given us at once, or
gradually.

{#7} In like manner, we are wholly ignorant, what degree of new knowledge, it
were to be expected, God would give mankind by revelation, upon supposition of
his affording one: or how far, or in what way, he would interpose miraculously,
to qualify them, to whom he should originally make the revelation, for
communicating the knowledge given by it; and to secure their doing it to the age
in which they should live; and to secure its being transmitted to posterity. We
are equally ignorant, whether the evidence of it would be certain or highly
probable, or doubtful:[n99] or whether all who should have any degree of
instruction from it, and any degree of evidence of its truth, would have the
same: or whether the scheme would be revealed at once, or unfolded
gradually.[n100] Nay we are not in any sort able to judge, whether it were to
have been expected, that the revelation should have been committed to writing;
or left to be handed down, and consequently corrupted, by verbal tradition, and
at length sunk under it, if mankind so pleased, and during such time as they are
permitted, in the degree they evidently are, to act as they will.

{#8} But it may be said, "that a revelation in some of the above-mentioned
circumstances, one, for instance, which was not committed to writing, and thus
secured against danger of corruption, would not have answered its purpose." I
ask, what purpose? It would not have answered all the purposes, which it has now
answered, and in the same degree: but it would have answered others, or the same
in different degrees. And which of these were the purposes of God, and best fell
in with his general government, we could not at all have determined beforehand.

{#9} Now since we have no principles of reason, upon which to judge beforehand,
how it were to be expected that revelation should have been left, or what was
most suitable to the divine plan of government, in any of the forementioned
respects; it must be quite frivolous to object afterwards as to any of them,
against its being left in one way, rather than another: for this would be to
object against things, upon account of their being different from expectations,
which has been shown to be without reason.

{#10} Thus we see, that the only question concerning the truth of Christianity
is, whether it be a real revelation; not whether it be attended with every
circumstance which we should have looked for: and concerning the authority of
Scripture, whether it be what it claims to be; not whether it be a book of such
sort, and so promulged, as weak men are apt to fancy a book containing a divine
revelation should be. Therefore, neither obscurity, nor seeming inaccuracy of
style, nor various readings, nor early disputes about the authors of particular
parts, nor any other things of the like kind, though they had been much more
considerable in degree than they are, could overthrow the authority of the
Scripture: unless the prophets, apostles, or our Lord, had promised, that the
book containing the divine revelation should be exempt from those things. Nor
indeed can any objections overthrow such a kind of revelation as the Christian
claims to be, (since there are no objections against the morality of it,[n101])
but such as can show, that there is no proof of miracles wrought originally in
attestation of it; no appearance of any thing miraculous in its obtaining in the
world; nor any of prophecy, that is, of events foretold, which human sagacity
could not foresee. If it can be shown, that the proof alleged for all these is
absolutely none at all, then is revelation overturned. But were it allowed, that
the proof of any one or all of them is lower than is allowed; yet, whilst _any_
proof of them remains, revelation will stand upon much the same foot it does at
present, as to all the purposes of life and practice, and ought to have the like
influence upon our behavior.

{#11} From the foregoing observations too, it will follow, and those who will
thoroughly examine into revelation will find it worth remarking, that there are
several ways of arguing, which though just with regard to other writings, are
not applicable to Scripture: at least not to its prophetic parts. We cannot
argue, for instance, that such and such cannot be the sense or intent of a
passage of Scripture, for, if it had, it would have been expressed more plainly,
or represented under a more apt figure or hieroglyphic. Yet we may justly argue
thus, with respect to common books. And the reason of this difference is very
evident. In Scripture we are not competent judges, as we are in common books,
how plainly it were to have been expected, that the sense should have been
expressed, or under how apt an image figured. The only question is, what
appearance there is, that this _is_ the sense; and scarce at all, how much more
determinately or accurately it might have been expressed or figured.

{#12} "But is it not self-evident, that internal improbabilities of all kinds
weaken external probable proof?" Doubtless. But to what practical purpose can
this be alleged here, when it has been proved before,[n102] that real internal
improbabilities, which rise even to moral certainty, are overcome by the most
ordinary testimony; and when it now has been made to appear, that we scarce know
what are improbabilities, as to the matter we are here considering: as it will
further appear from what follows.

{#13} From the observations made above it is manifest, that we are not in any
sort competent judges, what supernatural instruction were to have been expected;
and it is self-evident, that the objections of an incompetent judgment must be
frivolous. Yet it may be proper to go one step further, and observe, that if men
will be regardless of these things, and pretend to judge of the Scripture by
preconceived expectations; the analogy of nature shows beforehand, not only that
it is highly credible they may, but also probable that they will, imagine they
have strong objections against it, however really unexceptionable. For so, prior
to experience, they would think they had, against the circumstances, and
degrees, and the whole manner of that instruction, which is afforded by the
ordinary course of nature. Were the instruction which God affords to brute
creatures by instincts and mere propensions, and to mankind by these together
with reason, matter of probable proof, and not of certain observation: it would
be rejected as incredible, in many instances of it, only upon account of the
means by which this instruction is given, the seeming disproportions, the
limitations, necessary conditions, and circumstances of it. For instance: would
it not have been thought highly improbable, that men should have been so much
more capable of discovering, even to certainty, the general laws of matter, and
the magnitudes, paths, and revolutions, of heavenly bodies; than the occasions
and cures of distempers, and many other things in which human life seems so much
more nearly concerned, than in astronomy? How capricious and irregular a way of
information would it be said; is that of _invention_, by means of which nature
instructs us in matters of science, and in many things, upon which the affairs
of the world greatly depend: that a man should, by this faculty, be made
acquainted with a thing in an instant, (when perhaps he is thinking of something
else,) which he has in vain been searching after, it may be, for years.

{#14} So likewise the imperfections attending the only method, by which nature
enables and directs us to communicate our thoughts to each other, are
innumerable. Language is, in its very nature, inadequate, ambiguous, liable to
infinite abuse, even from negligence; and so liable to it from design, that
every man can deceive and betray by it. And, to mention but one instance more;
that brutes, without reason, should act, in many respects, with a sagacity and
foresight vastly greater than what men have in those respects, would be thought
impossible. Yet it is certain they do act with such superior foresight: whether
it be their own, indeed, is another question. From these things, it is highly
credible beforehand, that upon supposition that God should afford men some
additional instruction by revelation, it would be with circumstances, in
manners, degrees, and respects, against the credibility of which we should be
apt to fancy we had great objections. Nor are the objections against the
Scripture, nor against Christianity in general, at all more or greater, than the
analogy of nature would beforehand—not perhaps give ground to _expect_; (for the
analogy may not be sufficient, in some cases, to ground an expectation upon;)
but no more nor greater, than analogy would show it, beforehand, to be
supposable and _credible_, that there might seem to lie against revelation.

{#15} By applying these general observations to a particular objection, it will
be more distinctly seen, how they are applicable to others of the like kind; and
indeed to almost all objections against Christianity, as distinguished from
objections against its evidence. It appears from Scripture, that, as it was not
unusual in the apostolic age, for persons, upon their conversion to
Christianity, to be endued with miraculous gifts; so, some of those persons
exercised these gifts in a strangely irregular and disorderly manner;[n103] and
this is made an objection against their being really miraculous. Now the
foregoing observations quite remove this objection, how considerable soever it
may appear at first sight. For, consider a person endued with any of these
gifts, for instance that of tongues: it is to be supposed, that he had the same
power over this miraculous gift, as he would have had over it, had it been the
effect of habit, of study and use, as it ordinarily is; or the same power over
it, as he had over any other natural endowment. Consequently, he would use it in
the same manner as he did any other; either regularly, and upon proper occasions
only, or irregularly, and upon improper ones: according to his sense of decency,
and his character of prudence. Where then is the objection? Why, if this
miraculous power was indeed given to the world to propagate Christianity, and
attest the truth of it, we might, it seems, have expected, that other sort of
persons should have been chosen to be invested with it; or that these should, at
the same time, have been endued with prudence; or that they should have been
continually restrained and directed in the exercise of it: _i.e._ that God
should have miraculously interposed, if at all, in a different manner, or higher
degree. But, from the observations made above, it is undeniably evident, that we
are not judges in what degrees and manners it were to have been expected he
should miraculously interpose; upon supposition of his doing it in some degree
and manner. Nor, in the natural course of Providence, are superior gifts of
memory, eloquence, knowledge, and other talents of great influence, conferred
only on persons of prudence and decency, or such as are disposed to make the
properest use of them. Nor is the instruction and admonition naturally afforded
us for the conduct of life, particularly in our education, commonly given in a
manner the most suited to recommend it; but often with circumstances apt to
prejudice us against such instruction.

{#16} One might go on to add, there is a great resemblance between the light of
nature and of revelation, in several other respects. Practical Christianity, or
that faith and behavior which renders a man a Christian, is a plain and obvious
thing: like the common rules of conduct, with respect to ordinary temporal
affairs. The more distinct and particular knowledge of those things, the study
of which the apostle calls _going on unto perfection_,[n104] and of the
prophetic parts of revelation, like many parts of natural and even civil
knowledge, may require very exact thought, and careful consideration. The
hinderances too, of natural, and of supernatural light and knowledge, have been
of the same kind. And as it is owned the whole scheme of Scripture is not yet
understood; so, if it ever comes to be understood, before the _restitution of
all things_,[n105] and without miraculous interpositions, it must be in the same
way as natural knowledge is come at: by the continuance and progress of learning
and of liberty; and by particular persons attending to, comparing, and
pursuing, intimations scattered up and down it, which are overlooked and
disregarded by the generality of the world. For this is the way in which all
improvements are made; by thoughtful men's tracing on obscure hints, dropped us
by nature as it were, accidentally, or which seem to come into our minds by
chance. Nor is it at all incredible, that a book which has been so long in the
possession of mankind, should contain many truths as yet undiscovered. For, all
the same phenomena, and the same faculties of investigation, from which such
great discoveries in natural knowledge have been made in the present and last
age, were equally in the possession of mankind, several thousand years before.
And possibly it might be intended, that events, as they come to pass, should
open and ascertain the meaning of several parts of Scripture.

{#17} It may be objected, that this analogy fails in a material respect: for
that natural knowledge is of little or no consequence. But I have been speaking
of the general instruction which nature does or does not afford us. And besides,
some parts of natural knowledge, in the more common restrained sense of the
words, are of the greatest consequence to the ease and convenience of life. But
suppose the analogy did, as it does not, fail in this respect; yet it might be
abundantly supplied, from the whole constitution and course of nature: which
shows, that God does not dispense his gifts according to _our_ notions of the
advantage and consequence they would be of to us. And this in general, with his
method of dispensing knowledge in particular, would together make out an analogy
full to the point before us.

{#18} But it may be objected still further and more generally; "The Scripture
represents the world as in a state of ruin, and Christianity as an expedient to
recover it, to help in these respects where nature fails: in particular, to
supply the deficiencies of natural light. Is it credible then, that so many ages
should have been let pass, before a matter of such a sort, of so great and so
general importance, was made known to mankind; and then that it should be made
known to so small a part of them? Is it conceivable, that this supply should be
so very deficient, should have the like obscurity and doubtfulness, be liable to
the like perversions, in short, lie open to all the like objections, as the
light of nature itself?"[n106]

{#19} Without determining how far this, in fact, is so, I answer; it is by no
means incredible, that it might be so, if the light of nature and of revelation
be from the same hand. Men are naturally liable to diseases: for which God, in
his good providence, has provided natural remedies.[n107] But remedies existing
in nature have been unknown to mankind for many ages; are known but to few now;
probably many valuable ones are not known yet. Great has been and is the
obscurity and difficulty, in the nature and application of them. Circumstances
_seem_ often to make them very improper, where they are absolutely necessary. It
is after long labor and study, and many unsuccessful endeavors, that they are
brought to be as useful as they are; after high contempt and absolute rejection
of the most useful we have; and after disputes and doubts, which have seemed to
be endless. The best remedies too, when unskilfully, much more when dishonestly
applied, may produce new diseases; and with the rightest application the success
of them is often doubtful. In many cases they are not effectual: where they are,
it is often very slowly: and the application of them, and the necessary regimen
accompanying it, is not uncommonly so disagreeable, that some will not submit to
them; and satisfy themselves with the excuse, that if they would, it is not
certain whether it would be successful. And many persons, who labor under
diseases, for which there are known natural remedies, are not so happy as to be
always, if ever, in the way of them. In a word, the remedies which nature has
provided for diseases are neither certain, perfect, nor universal. And indeed
the same principles of arguing, which would lead us to conclude, that they must
be so, would lead us likewise to conclude, that there could be no occasion for
them; _i.e._ that there could be no diseases at all. And therefore our
experience that there are diseases, shows that it is credible beforehand, upon
supposition nature has provided remedies for them, that these remedies may be,
as by experience we find they are, neither certain, nor perfect, nor universal;
because it shows, that the principles upon which we should expect the contrary
are fallacious.

{#20} And now, what is the just consequence from all these things? Not that
reason is no judge of what is offered to us as being of divine revelation. For
this would be to infer that we are unable to judge of any thing, because we are
unable to judge of all things. Reason can, and it ought to judge, not only of
the meaning, but also of the morality and the evidence of revelation.

{#21} _First_, It is the province of reason to judge of the morality of the
Scripture; _i.e._ not whether it contains things different from what we should
have expected from a wise, just, and good Being; (for objections from hence have
been now obviated:) but whether it contains things plainly contradictory to
wisdom, justice, or goodness; to what the light of nature teaches us of God. And
I know nothing of this sort objected against Scripture, excepting such
objections as are formed upon suppositions, which would equally conclude, that
the constitution of nature is contradictory to wisdom, justice, or goodness;
which most certainly it is not. There are, indeed, some particular precepts in
Scripture, given to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be
immoral and vicious, were it not for such precepts. But it is easy to see, that
all these are of such a kind, as that the precept changes the whole nature of
the case and of the action; and both constitutes and shows that not to be unjust
or immoral, which, prior to the precept, must have appeared and really been so:
which may well be, since none of these precepts are contrary to immutable
morality. If it were commanded, to cultivate the _principles_, and act from the
spirit of treachery, ingratitude, cruelty; the command would not alter the
nature of the case or of the action, in any of these instances. But it is quite
otherwise in precepts, which require only the doing an _external action_: for
instance, taking away the property, or life of any. For men have no right,
either to life or property, but what arises solely from the grant of God. When
this grant is revoked, they cease to have any right at all in either: and when
this revocation is made known, as surely it is possible it may be, it must cease
to be unjust to deprive them of either. And though a course of external acts,
which without command would be immoral, must make an immoral habit; yet a few
detached commands have no such natural tendency. I thought proper to say thus
much of the few Scripture precepts, which require, not vicious actions, but
actions which would have been vicious, but for such precepts; because they are
sometimes weakly urged as immoral, and great weight is laid upon objections
drawn from them.

{#22} To me there seems no difficulty at all in these precepts, but what arises
from their being offences: _i.e._ from their being liable to be perverted, as
indeed they are, by wicked designing men, to serve the most horrid purposes; and
perhaps to mislead the weak and enthusiastic. And objections from this head are
not objections against revelation; but against the whole notion of religion, as
a trial: and against the general constitution of nature.

{#23} _Secondly_, Reason is able to judge, and must, of the evidence of
revelation, and of the objections urged against that evidence: which shall be
the subject of a following chapter.[n108]

{#24} The consequence of the foregoing observations is, that the question upon
which the truth of Christianity depends, is scarcely at all what objections
there are against its scheme, since there are none against the morality of it,
but _what objections there are against its evidence_; or, _what proof there
remains of it, after due allowances are made for the objections against that
proof_: because it has been shown, that the _objections against Christianity, as
distinguished from objections against its evidence, are frivolous_. For surely
very little weight, if any at all, is to be laid upon a way of arguing and
objecting, which, when applied to the general constitution of nature, experience
shows not to be conclusive: and such, I think, is the whole way of objecting
treated of throughout this chapter. It is resolvable into principles, and goes
upon suppositions, which mislead us to think, that the Author of nature would
not act, as we experience he does; or would act, in such and such cases, as we
experience he does not in like cases. But the unreasonableness of this way of
objecting will appear yet more evidently from hence, that the chief things thus
objected against are justified, as shall be further shown,[n109] by distinct,
particular, and full analogies, in the constitution and course of nature.

{#25} It is to be remembered, that, as frivolous as objections of the foregoing
sort against revelation are, yet, when a supposed revelation is more consistent
with itself, and has a more general and uniform tendency to promote virtue,
than, all circumstances considered, could have been expected from enthusiasm and
political views, this is a presumptive proof of its not proceeding from them,
and so of its truth: because we are competent judges, what might have been
expected from enthusiasm and political views.
