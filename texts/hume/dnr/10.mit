{#1,pages=193} ^It^ is my opinion, I own, replied ^=Demea=^, that each man feels,
in a manner, the truth of religion within his own breast; and from a
consciousness of his imbecility and misery, rather than from any reasoning, is
led to seek protection from that Being, on whom he and all nature is dependent.
So anxious or so tedious are even the best scenes of life, that futurity is
still the object of all our hopes and fears. We incessantly look forward, and
endeavour, by prayers, adoration, and sacrifice, to appease those unknown
powers, whom we find, by experience, so able to afflict and oppress us. Wretched
creatures that we are! what resource for us amidst the innumerable ills of life,
did not Religion suggest some methods of atonement, and appease those terrors,
with which we are incessantly agitated and tormented?

{#2,pages=193} I am indeed persuaded, said ^=Philo=^, that the best and indeed the
only method of bringing every one to a due sense of religion, is by just
representations of the misery and wickedness of men. And for that purpose a
talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more requisite than that of reasoning
and argument. For is it necessary to prove, what every one feels within himself?
'Tis only necessary to make us feel it, if possible, more intimately and
sensibly.

{#3,pages=193} The people, indeed, replied ^=Demea=^, are sufficiently convinced
of this great and melancholy truth. The miseries of life, the unhappiness of
man, the general corruptions of our nature, the unsatisfactory enjoyment of
pleasures, riches, honours; these phrases have become almost proverbial in all
languages. And who can doubt of what all men declare from their own immediate
feeling and experience?

{#4,pages=193-4} In this point, said ^=Philo=^, the learned are perfectly agreed
with the vulgar; and in all letters, _sacred_ and _profane_, the topic of human
misery has been insisted on with the most pathetic eloquence, that sorrow and
melancholy could inspire. The poets, who speak from sentiment, without a system,
and whose testimony has therefore the more authority, abound in images of this
nature. From ^Homer^ down to Dr ^Young^, the whole inspired tribe have ever been
sensible, that no other |representation of things would suit the feeling and
observation of each individual.

{#5,pages=194} As to authorities, replied ^=Demea=^, you need not seek them. Look
round this library of ^=Cleanthes=^. I shall venture to affirm, that, except
authors of particular sciences, such as chymistry or botany, who have no
occasion to treat of human life, there is scarce one of those innumerable
writers, from whom the sense of human misery has not, in some passage or other,
extorted a complaint and confession of it. At least, the chance is entirely on
that side; and no one author has ever, so far as I can recollect, been so
extravagant as to deny it.

{#6,pages=194} There you must excuse me, said ^=Philo=^: ^Leibnitz^ has denied it;
and is perhaps the first[n9], who ventured upon so bold and paradoxical an
opinion; at least, the first, who made it essential to his philosophical system.

{#7,pages=194} And by being the first, replied ^=Demea=^, might he not have been
sensible of his error? For is this a subject, in which philosophers can propose
to make discoveries, especially in so late an age? And can any man hope by a
simple denial (for the subject scarcely admits of reasoning) to bear down the
united testimony of mankind, founded on sense and consciousness?

{#8,pages=194} And why should man, added he, pretend to an exemption from the
lot of all other animals? The whole earth, believe me, ^=Philo=^, is cursed and
polluted. A perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures. Necessity,
hunger, want, stimulate the strong and courageous: Fear, anxiety, terror,
agitate the weak and infirm. The first entrance into life gives anguish to the
new-born infant and to its wretched parent: Weakness, impotence, distress,
attend each stage of that life: and 'tis at last finished in agony and horror.

{#9,pages=194-5} Observe too, says ^=Philo=^, the curious artifices of Nature, in
order to imbitter the life of every living being. The stronger prey upon the
weaker, and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety. The weaker too, in their
turn, often prey upon the stronger, and vex and molest them without relaxation.
Consider that innumerable race of insects, which either are bred on the body of
each animal, or flying about infix their stings in him. These insects have
others still less than themselves, |which torment them. And thus on each hand,
before and behind, above and below, every animal is surrounded with enemies,
which incessantly seek his misery and destruction.

{#10,pages=195} Man alone, said ^=Demea=^, seems to be, in part, an exception to
this rule. For by combination in society, he can easily master lions, tygers,
and bears, whose greater strength and agility naturally enable them to prey upon
him.

{#11,pages=195} On the contrary, it is here chiefly, cried ^=Philo=^, that the
uniform and equal maxims of Nature are most apparent. Man, it is true, can, by
combination, surmount all his _real_ enemies, and become master of the whole
animal creation: but does he not immediately raise up to himself _imaginary_
enemies, the d{ae}mons of his fancy, who haunt him with superstitious terrors,
and blast every enjoyment of life? His pleasure, as he imagines, becomes, in
their eyes, a crime: his food and repose give them umbrage and offence: his very
sleep and dreams furnish new materials to anxious fear: and even death, his
refuge from every other ill, presents only the dread of endless and innumerable
woes. Nor does the wolf molest more the timid flock, than superstition does the
anxious breast of wretched mortals.

{#12,pages=195} Besides, consider, ^=Demea=^; this very society, by which we
surmount those wild beasts, our natural enemies; what new enemies does it not
raise to us? What woe and misery does it not occasion? Man is the greatest enemy
of man. Oppression, injustice, contempt, contumely, violence, sedition, war,
calumny, treachery, fraud; by these they mutually torment each other: and they
would soon dissolve that society which they had formed, were it not for the
dread of still greater ills, which must attend their separation.

{#13,pages=195-6} But though these external insults, said ^=Demea=^, from animals,
from men, from all the elements, which assault us, form a frightful catalogue of
woes, they are nothing in comparison of those, which arise within ourselves,
from the distempered condition of our mind and body. How many lie under the
lingering torment of diseases? Hear the pathetic enumeration of the great poet.
""Intestine stone and ulcer, colic-pangs, //
D{ae}moniac frenzy, moping melancholy, //
And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, //
Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence. //
|Dire was the tossing, deep the groans: DESPAIR //
Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch. //
And over them triumphant DEATH his dart //
Shook: but delay'd to strike, tho' oft invok'd //
With vows, as their chief good and final hope.""

{#14,pages=196} The disorders of the mind, continued ^=Demea=^, though more
secret, are not perhaps less dismal and vexatious. Remorse, shame, anguish,
rage, disappointment, anxiety, fear, dejection, despair; who has ever passed
through life without cruel inroads from these tormentors? How many have scarcely
ever felt any better sensations? Labour and poverty, so abhorred by every one,
are the certain lot of the far greater number: and those few privileged persons,
who enjoy ease and opulence, never reach contentment or true felicity. All the
goods of life united would not make a very happy man: but all the ills united
would make a wretch indeed; and any one of them almost (and who can be free from
every one) nay often the absence of one good (and who can possess all) is
sufficient to render life ineligible.

{#15,pages=196} Were a stranger to drop, on a sudden, into this world, I would
show him, as a specimen of its ills, an hospital full of diseases, a prison
crowded with malefactors and debtors, a field of battle strowed with carcasses,
a fleet foundering in the ocean, a nation languishing under tyranny, famine, or
pestilence. To turn the gay side of life to him, and give him a notion of its
pleasures; whither should I conduct him? to a ball, to an opera, to court? He
might justly think, that I was only showing him a diversity of distress and
sorrow.

{#16,pages=196} There is no evading such striking instances, said ^=Philo=^, but
by apologies, which still farther aggravate the charge. Why have all men, I ask,
in all ages, complained incessantly of the miseries of life? - - - - They have
no just reason, says one: these complaints proceed only from their discontented,
repining, anxious disposition. - - - And can there possibly, I reply, be a more
certain foundation of misery, than such a wretched temper?

{#17,pages=196-7} But if they were really as unhappy as they pretend, says my
antagonist, why do they remain in life? - - -
""Not satisfied with life, afraid of death.""
|This is the secret chain, say I, that holds us. We are terrified, not bribed
to the continuance of our existence.

{#18,pages=197} It is only a false delicacy, he may insist, which a few refined
spirits indulge, and which has spread these complaints among the whole race of
mankind. - - - - - And what is this delicacy, I ask, which you blame? Is it any
thing but a greater sensibility to all the pleasures and pains of life? and if
the man of a delicate, refined temper, by being so much more alive than the rest
of the world, is only so much more unhappy; what judgement must we form in
general of human life?

{#19,pages=197} Let men remain at rest, says our adversary; and they will be
easy. They are willing artificers of their own misery. - - - No! reply I; an
anxious languor follows their repose: disappointment, vexation, trouble, their
activity and ambition.

{#20,pages=197} I can observe something like what you mention in some others,
replied ^=Cleanthes=^: but I confess, I feel little or nothing of it in myself;
and hope that it is not so common as you represent it.

{#21,pages=197} If you feel not human misery yourself, cried ^=Demea=^, I
congratulate you on so happy a singularity. Others, seemingly the most
prosperous, have not been ashamed to vent their complaints in the most
melancholy strains. Let us attend to the great, the fortunate Emperor, ^=Charles
V=^, when, tired with human grandeur, he resigned all his extensive dominions
into the hands of his son. In the last harangue, which he made on that memorable
occasion, he publicly avowed, _that the greatest prosperities which he had ever
enjoyed, had been mixed with so many adversities, that he might truly say he had
never enjoyed any satisfaction or contentment_{++.++} But did the retired life,
in which he sought for shelter, afford him any greater happiness? If we may
credit his son's account, his repentance commenced the very day of his
resignation.

{#22,pages=197} ^Cicero^'s fortune, from small beginnings, rose to the greatest
lustre and renown; yet what pathetic complaints of the ills of life do his
familiar letters, as well as philosophical discourses, contain? And suitably to
his own experience, he introduces ^Cato^, the great, the fortunate ^Cato^,
protesting in his old age, that, had he a new life in his offer, he would reject
the present.

{#23,pages=197-8} Ask yourself, ask any of your acquaintance, whether they would
live over again the last ten or twenty years of their life. No! but the next
twenty, they say, will be better:
""|And from the dregs of life, hope to receive //
What the first sprightly running could not give.""
 Thus at last they find (such is the greatness of human misery; it reconciles
even contradictions) that they complain, at once, of the shortness of life, and
of its vanity and sorrow.

{#24,pages=198} And is it possible, ^=Cleanthes=^, said ^=Philo=^, that after all
these reflections, and infinitely more, which might be suggested, you can still
persevere in your Anthropomorphism, and assert the moral attributes of the
Deity, his justice, benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature
with these virtues in human creatures? His power we allow infinite: whatever he
wills is executed: but neither man nor any other animal {~~are->is~~} happy:
therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: he is never
mistaken in chusing the means to any end: but the course of Nature tends not to
human or animal felicity: therefore it is not established for that purpose.
Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more
certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and
mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?

{#25,pages=198} ^Epicurus^'s old questions are yet unanswered. Is he willing to
prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing?
then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?

{#26,pages=198} You ascribe, ^=Cleanthes=^, (and I believe justly) a purpose and
intention to Nature. But what, I beseech you, is the object of that curious
artifice and machinery, which she has displayed in all animals? The preservation
alone of individuals and propagation of the species. It seems enough for her
purpose, if such a rank be barely upheld in the universe, without any care or
concern for the happiness of the members, that compose it. No resource for this
purpose: no machinery, in order merely to give pleasure or ease: no fund of pure
joy and contentment: no indulgence without some want or necessity, accompanying
it. At least, the few phenomena of this nature are over-balanced by opposite
phenomena of still greater importance.

{#27,pages=198-9} Our sense of music, harmony, and indeed beauty of all kinds
gives satisfaction, without being absolutely necessary to |the preservation and
propagation of the species. But what racking pains, on the other hand, arise
from gouts, gravels, megrims, tooth-achs, rheumatisms; where the injury to the
animal-machinery is either small or incurable? Mirth, laughter, play, frolic,
seem gratuitous satisfactions, which have no farther tendency: spleen,
melancholy, discontent, superstition, are pains of the same nature. How then
does the divine benevolence display itself, in the sense of you
Anthropomorphites? None but we Mystics, as you were pleased to call us, can
account for this strange mixture of phenomena, by deriving it from attributes,
infinitely perfect, but incomprehensible.

{#28,pages=199} And have you at last, said ^=Cleanthes=^ smiling, betrayed your
intentions, ^=Philo=^? Your long agreement with ^=Demea=^ did indeed a little
surprise me; but I find you were all the while erecting a concealed battery
against me. And I must confess, that you have now fallen upon a subject, worthy
of your noble spirit of opposition and controversy. If you can make out the
present point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupted, there is an end at
once of all religion. For to what purpose establish the natural attributes of
the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain?

{#29,pages=199} You take umbrage very easily, replied ^=Demea=^, at opinions the
most innocent, and the most generally received even amongst the religious and
devout themselves: and nothing can be more surprising than to find a topic like
this, concerning the wickedness and misery of man, charged with no less than
Atheism and profaneness. Have not all pious divines and preachers, who have
indulged their rhetoric on so fertile a subject; have they not easily, I say,
given a solution of any difficulties, which may attend it? This world is but a
point in comparison of the universe: this life but a moment in comparison of
eternity. The present evil phenomena, therefore, are rectified in other regions,
and in some future period of existence. And the eyes of men, being then opened
to larger views of things, see the whole connection of general laws, and trace,
with adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity, through all the
mazes and intricacies of his providence.

{#30,pages=199-200} No! replied ^=Cleanthes=^, No! These arbitrary suppositions
can never be admitted, contrary to matter of fact, visible and uncontroverted.
Whence can any cause be known but from its known effects? Whence can any
hypothesis be proved but |from the apparent phenomena? To establish one
hypothesis upon another is building entirely in the air; and the utmost we ever
attain, by these conjectures and fictions, is to ascertain the bare possibility
of our opinion; but never can we, upon such terms, establish its reality.

{#31,pages=200} The only method of supporting divine benevolence (and it is what
I willingly embrace) is to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man.
Your representations are exaggerated: Your melancholy views mostly fictitious:
Your inferences contrary to fact and experience. Health is more common than
sickness: Pleasure than pain: Happiness than misery. And for one vexation, which
we meet with, we attain, upon computation, a hundred enjoyments.

{#32,pages=200} Admitting your position, replied ^=Philo=^, which yet is extremely
doubtful; you must, at the same time, allow, that, if pain be less frequent than
pleasure, it is infinitely more violent and durable. One hour of it is often
able to outweigh a day, a week, a month of our common insipid enjoyments: And
how many days, weeks, and months are passed by several in the most acute
torments? Pleasure, scarcely in one instance, is ever able to reach ecstasy and
rapture: And in no one instance can it continue for any time at its highest
pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate; the nerves relax; the fabric is
disordered; and the enjoyment quickly degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness.
But pain often, good God, how often! rises to torture and agony; and the longer
it continues, it becomes still more genuine agony and torture. Patience is
exhausted; courage languishes; melancholy seizes us; and nothing terminates our
misery but the removal of its cause, or another event, which is the sole cure of
all evil, but which, from our natural folly, we regard with still greater horror
and consternation.

{#33,pages=200-1} But not to insist upon these topics, continued ^=Philo=^, though
most obvious, certain, and important; I must use the freedom to admonish you,
^=Cleanthes=^, that you have put the controversy upon a most dangerous issue, and
are, unawares introducing a total Scepticism into the most essential articles of
natural and revealed theology. What! no method of fixing a just foundation for
religion, unless we allow the happiness of human life, and maintain a continued
existence even in this world, with all our present pains, infirmities,
vexations, and |follies, to be eligible and desireable! But this is contrary to
every one's feeling and experience: It is contrary to an authority so
established as nothing can subvert: No decisive proofs can ever be produced
against this authority; nor is it possible for you to compute, estimate, and
compare all the pains and all the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all
animals: And thus by your resting the whole system of religion on a point,
which, from its very nature, must for ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess,
that that system is equally uncertain.

{#34,pages=201} But allowing you, what never will be believed; at least, what
you never possibly can prove, that animal, or at least, human happiness in this
life exceeds its misery; you have yet done nothing: For this is not, by any
means, what we expect from infinite power, infinite wisdom, and infinite
goodness. Why is there any misery at all in the world? Not by chance surely.
From some cause then. Is it from the intention of the Deity? But he is perfectly
benevolent. Is it contrary to his intention? But he is almighty. Nothing can
shake the solidity of this reasoning, so short, so clear, so decisive; except we
assert, that these subjects exceed all human capacity, and that our common
measures of truth and falsehood are not applicable to them; a topic, which I
have all along insisted on, but which you have, from the beginning, rejected
with scorn and indignation.

{#35,pages=201} But I will be contented to retire still from this intrenchment:
For I deny that you can ever force me in it: I will allow, that pain or misery
in man is _compatible_ with infinite power and goodness in the Deity, even in
your sense of these attributes: What are you advanced by all these concessions?
A mere possible compatibility is not sufficient. You must _prove_ these pure,
unmixt, and uncontrollable attributes from the present mixt and confused
phenomena, and from these alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the phenomena ever
so pure and unmixt, yet being finite, they would be insufficient for that
purpose. How much more, where they are also so jarring and discordant!

{#36,pages=201-2} Here, ^=Cleanthes=^, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here
I triumph. Formerly, when we argued concerning the |natural attributes of
intelligence and design, I needed all my sceptical and metaphysical subtilty to
elude your grasp. In many views of the universe, and of its parts, particularly
the latter, the beauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such
irresistible force, that all objections appear (what I believe they really are)
mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then imagine how it was ever possible for
us to repose any weight on them. But there is no view of human life or of the
condition of mankind, from which, without the greatest violence, we can infer
the moral attributes, or learn that infinite benevolence, conjoined with
infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of faith
alone. It is your turn now to tug the labouring oar, and to support your
philosophical subtilties against the dictates of plain reason and experience.

{#n9,pages=194} That sentiment had been maintained by =Dr King= and some few
others before ^=Leibniz=^; though by none of so great fame as that ^German^
philosopher.
