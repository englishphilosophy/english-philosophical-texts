{#1,pages=165} ^But^ to show you still more inconveniencies, continued ^Philo^,
in your Anthropomorphism; please to take a new survey of your principles. _Like
effects prove like causes_{++.++} This is the experimental argument; and this,
you say too, is the sole theological argument. Now it is certain, that the liker
the effects are, which are seen, and the liker the causes, which are inferred,
the stronger is the argument. Every departure on either side diminishes the
probability, and renders the experiment less conclusive. You cannot doubt of the
principle: neither ought you to reject its consequences.

{#2,pages=165-6} All the new discoveries in astronomy, which prove the immense
grandeur and magnificence of the works of Nature, are so many additional
arguments for a Deity, according to the true system of Theism: but according to
your hypothesis of experimental Theism, they become so many objections, by
removing the effect still farther from all resemblance to the effects of human
art and contrivance. For if ^Lucretius^[n5], even following the old system of
the world, could exclaim,
""Quis regere immensi summam, quis habere profundi //
Indu manu validas potis est moderanter habenas? //
Quis pariter c{oe}los omnes convertere? et omnes //
Ignibus {ae}theriis terras suffire feraces? //
Omnibus inque locis esse omni tempore pr{ae}sto?""
 If _Tully_[n6] esteemed this reasoning so natural as to put it into the mouth
of his ^Epicurean^. _Quibus enim oculis animi intueri potuit vester Plato
fabricam illam tanti operis, qua construi a Deo |atque {ae}dificari mundum
facit? qu{ae} molitio? qu{ae} ferramenta? qui vectes? qu{ae} machin{ae}? qui
ministri tanti muneris fuerunt? quemadmodum autem obedire et parere voluntati
architecti aer, ignis, aqua, terra potuerunt?_ If this argument, I say, had any
force in former ages; how much greater must it have at present; when the bounds
of Nature are so infinitely enlarged, and such a magnificent scene is opened to
us? It is still more unreasonable to form our idea of so unlimited a cause from
our experience of the narrow productions of human design and invention.

{#3,pages=166} The discoveries by microscopes, as they open a new universe in
miniature, are still objections, according to you; arguments, according to me.
The farther we push our researches of this kind, we are still led to infer the
universal cause of all to be vastly different from mankind, or from any object
of human experience and observation.

{#4,pages=166} And what say you to the discoveries in anatomy, chymistry,
botany? - - - These surely are no objections, replied ^Cleanthes^: they only
discover new instances of art and contrivance. It is still the image of mind
reflected on us from innumerable objects. Add, a mind _like the human_, said
^Philo^. I know of no other, replied ^Cleanthes^. And the liker the better,
insisted ^Philo^. To be sure, said ^Cleanthes^.

{#5,pages=166} Now, ^Cleanthes^, said ^Philo^, with an air of alacrity and
triumph, mark the consequences. _First_, By this method of reasoning, you
renounce all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of the Deity. For as the
cause ought only to be proportioned to the effect, and the effect, so far as it
falls under our cognisance, is not infinite; what pretensions have we, upon your
suppositions, to ascribe that attribute to the divine Being? You will still
insist, that, by removing him so much from all similarity to human creatures, we
give into the most arbitrary hypothesis, and at the same time, weaken all proofs
of his existence.

{#6,pages=166-7} _Secondly_, You have no reason, on your theory, for ascribing
perfection to the Deity, even in his finite capacity; or for supposing him free
from every error, mistake, or incoherence in his undertakings. There are many
inexplicable difficulties in the works of Nature, which, if we allow a perfect
author to be proved _a priori_, are easily solved, and become only seeming
difficulties, from the narrow capacity of man, who cannot |trace infinite
relations. But according to your method of reasoning, these difficulties become
all real; and perhaps will be insisted on, as new instances of likeness to human
art and contrivance. At least, you must acknowledge, that it is impossible for
us to tell, from our limited views, whether this system contains any great
faults, or deserves any considerable praise, if compared to other possible, and
even real systems. Could a peasant, if the ^Aeneid^ were read to him, pronounce
that poem to be absolutely faultless, or even assign to it its proper rank among
the productions of human wit; he, who had never seen any other production?

{#7,pages=167} But were this world ever so perfect a production, it must still
remain uncertain, whether all the excellencies of the work can justly be
ascribed to the workman. If we survey a ship, what an exalted idea must we form
of the ingenuity of the carpenter, who framed so complicated, useful and
beautiful a machine? And what surprise must we feel, when we find him a stupid
mechanic, who imitated others, and copied an art, which, through a long
succession of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, corrections,
deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving? Many worlds
might have been botched and bungled, throughout an eternity, ere this system was
struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but
continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of
world-making. In such subjects, who can determine, where the truth; nay, who can
conjecture where the probability, lies; amidst a great number of hypotheses
which may be proposed, and a still greater number, which may be imagined?

{#8,pages=167-8} And what shadow of an argument, continued ^Philo^, can you
produce, from your hypothesis, to prove the unity of the Deity? A great number
of men join in building a house or ship, in rearing a city, in framing a
commonwealth: why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing a
world? This is only so much greater similarity to human affairs. By sharing the
work among several, we may so much farther limit the attributes of each, and get
rid of that extensive power and knowledge, which must be supposed in one deity,
and which, according to you, can only serve to weaken the |proof of his
existence. And if such foolish, such vicious creatures as man can yet often
unite in framing and executing one plan; how much more those deities or
d{ae}mons, whom we may suppose several degrees more perfect?

{#9,pages=168} To multiply causes, without necessity, is indeed contrary to true
philosophy: but this principle applies not to the present case. Were one deity
antecedently proved by your theory, who were possessed of every attribute,
requisite to the production of the universe; it would be needless, I own (though
not absurd) to suppose any other deity existent. But while it is still a
question, Whether all these attributes are united in one subject, or dispersed
among several independent beings: by what phenomena in nature can we pretend to
decide the controversy? Where we see a body raised in a scale, we are sure that
there is in the opposite scale, however concealed from sight, some
counterpoising weight equal to it: but it is still allowed to doubt, whether
that weight be an aggregate of several distinct bodies, or one uniform united
mass. And if the weight requisite very much exceeds any thing which we have ever
seen conjoined in any single body, the former supposition becomes still more
probable and natural. An intelligent being of such vast power and capacity, as
is necessary to produce the universe, or, to speak in the language of ancient
philosophy, so prodigious an animal, exceeds all analogy and even comprehension.

{#10,pages=168} But farther, ^Cleanthes^; men are mortal, and renew their
species by generation; and this is common to all living creatures. The two great
sexes of male and female, says MILTON, animate the world. Why must this
circumstance, so universal, so essential, be excluded from those numerous and
limited deities? Behold then the theogony of ancient times brought back upon us.

{#11,pages=168} And why not become a perfect Anthropomorphite? Why not assert
the deity or deities to be corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears,
&c.? ^Epicurus^ maintained, that no man had ever seen reason but in a human
figure; therefore the gods must have a human figure. And this argument, which is
deservedly so much ridiculed by ^Cicero^, becomes, according to you, solid and
philosophical.

{#12,pages=168-9} In a word, ^Cleanthes^, a man, who follows your hypothesis, is
able, perhaps, to assert, or conjecture, that the universe, |sometime, arose
from something like design: but beyond that position he cannot ascertain one
single circumstance, and is left afterwards to fix every point of his theology,
by the utmost licence of fancy and hypothesis. This world, for aught he knows,
is very faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior standard; and was only the
first rude essay of some infant deity, who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of
his lame performance: it is the work only of some dependent, inferior deity; and
is the object of derision to his superiors: it is the production of old age and
dotage in some superannuated deity; and ever since his death, has run on at
adventures, from the first impulse and active force, which it received from him.
You justly give signs of horror, ^Demea^, at these strange suppositions: but
these, and a thousand more of the same kind, are ^Cleanthes^'s suppositions, not
mine. From the moment the attributes of the Deity are supposed finite, all these
have place. And I cannot, for my part, think, that so wild and unsettled a
system of theology is, in any respect, preferable to none at all.

{#13,pages=169} These suppositions I absolutely disown, cried ^Cleanthes^: they
strike me, however, with no horror; especially, when proposed in that rambling
way, in which they drop from you. On the contrary, they give me pleasure, when I
see, that, by the utmost indulgence of your imagination, you never get rid of
the hypothesis of design in the universe; but are obliged, at every turn, to
have recourse to it. To this concession I adhere steadily; and this I regard as
a sufficient foundation for religion.
