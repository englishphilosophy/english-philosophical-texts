{#1,pages=182} ^What^ you ascribe to the fertility of my invention, replied
^Philo^, is entirely owing to the nature of the subject. In subjects, adapted to
the narrow compass of human reason, there is commonly but one determination,
which carries probability or conviction with it; and to a man of sound
judgement, all other suppositions, but that one, appear entirely absurd and
chimerical. But in such questions, as the present, a hundred contradictory views
may preserve a kind of imperfect analogy; and invention has here full scope to
exert itself. Without any great effort of thought, I believe that I could, in an
instant, propose other systems of cosmogony, which would have some faint
appearance of truth; though it is a thousand, a million to one, if either yours
or any one of mine be the true system.

{#2,pages=182} For instance; what if I should revive the old ^Epicurean^
hypothesis? This is commonly, and I believe, justly, esteemed the most absurd
system, that has yet been proposed; yet, I know not, whether, with a few
alterations, it might not be brought to bear a faint appearance of probability.
Instead of supposing matter infinite, as ^Epicurus^ did; let us suppose it
finite. A finite number of particles is only susceptible of finite
transpositions: and it must happen, in an eternal duration, that every possible
order or position must be tried an infinite number of times. This world,
therefore, with all its events, even the most minute, has before been produced
and destroyed, and will again be produced and destroyed, without any bounds and
limitations. No one, who has a conception of the powers of infinite, in
comparison of finite, will ever scruple this determination.

{#3,pages=182} But this supposes, said ^Demea^, that matter can acquire motion,
without any voluntary agent or first mover.

{#4,pages=182-3} And where is the difficulty, replied ^Philo^, of that
supposition? Every event, before experience, is equally difficult and
incomprehensible; and every event, after experience, is equally easy and
intelligible. Motion, in many instances, from gravity, from elasticity, from
electricity, begins in matter, without any known voluntary agent; and to suppose
always, in these cases, |an unknown voluntary agent, is mere hypothesis; and
hypothesis attended with no advantages. The beginning of motion in matter itself
is as conceivable _a priori_ as its communication from mind and intelligence.

{#5,pages=183} Besides; why may not motion have been propagated by impulse
through all eternity, and the same stock of it, or nearly the same, be still
upheld in the universe? As much as is lost by the composition of motion, as much
is gained by its resolution. And whatever the causes are, the fact is certain,
that matter is, and always has been in continual agitation, as far as human
experience or tradition reaches. There is not probably, at present, in the whole
universe, one particle of matter at absolute rest.

{#6,pages=183-4} And this very consideration too, continued ^Philo^, which we
have stumbled on in the course of the argument, suggests a new hypothesis of
cosmogony, that is not absolutely absurd and improbable. Is there a system, an
order, an {oe}conomy of things, by which matter can preserve that perpetual
agitation, which seems essential to it, and yet maintain a constancy in the
forms, which it produces? There certainly is such an {oe}conomy: for this is
actually the case with the present world. The continual motion of matter,
therefore, in less than infinite transpositions, must produce this {oe}conomy or
order; and by its very nature, that order, when once established, supports
itself, for many ages, if not to eternity. But where-ever matter is so poized,
arranged, and adjusted as to continue in perpetual motion, and yet preserve a
constancy in the forms, its situation must, of necessity, have all the same
appearance of art and contrivance, which we observe at present. All the parts of
each form must have a relation to each other, and to the whole: and the whole
itself must have a relation to the other parts of the universe; to the element,
in which the form subsists; to the materials, with which it repairs its waste
and decay; and to every other form, which is hostile or friendly. A defect in
any of these particulars destroys the form; and the matter, of which it is
composed, is again set loose, and is thrown into irregular motions and
fermentations, till it unite itself to some other regular form. If no such form
be prepared to receive it, and if there be a great quantity of this corrupted
matter in the universe, the universe itself is entirely disordered; whether |it
be the feeble embryo of a world in its first beginnings, that is thus destroyed,
or the rotten carcass of one, languishing in old age and infirmity. In either
case, a chaos ensues; till finite, though innumerable revolutions produce at
last some forms, whose parts and organs are so adjusted as to support the forms
amidst a continued succession of matter.

{#7,pages=184} Suppose, (for we shall endeavour to vary the expression) that
matter were thrown into any position, by a blind, unguided force; it is evident
that this first position must in all probability be the most confused and most
disorderly imaginable, without any resemblance to those works of human
contrivance, which, along with a symmetry of parts, discover an adjustment of
means to ends and a tendency to self-preservation. If the actuating force cease
after this operation, matter must remain for ever in disorder, and continue an
immense chaos, without any proportion or activity. But suppose, that the
actuating force, whatever it be, still continues in matter, this first position
will immediately give place to a second, which will likewise in all probability
be as disorderly as the first, and so on, through many successions of changes
and revolutions. No particular order or position ever continues a moment
unaltered. The original force, still remaining in activity, gives a perpetual
restlessness to matter. Every possible situation is produced, and instantly
destroyed. If a glimpse or dawn of order appears for a moment, it is instantly
hurried away and confounded, by that never-ceasing force, which actuates every
part of matter.

{#8,pages=184-5} Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued
succession of chaos and disorder. But is it not possible that it may settle at
last, so as not to lose its motion and active force (for that we have supposed
inherent in it) yet so as to preserve an uniformity of appearance, amidst the
continual motion and fluctuation of its parts? This we find to be the case with
the universe at present. Every individual is perpetually changing, and every
part of every individual, and yet the whole remains, in appearance, the same.
May we not hope for such a position, or rather be assured of it, from the
eternal revolutions of unguided matter, and may not this account for all the
appearing wisdom and contrivance, which is in the universe? Let us |contemplate
the subject a little, and we shall find, that this adjustment, if attained by
matter, of a seeming stability in the forms, with a real and perpetual
revolution or motion of parts, affords a plausible, if not a true solution of
the difficulty.

{#9,pages=185} It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon the uses of the parts in
animals or vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain
know how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted? Do we not
find, that it immediately perishes whenever this adjustment ceases, and that its
matter corrupting tries some new form? It happens, indeed, that the parts of the
world are so well adjusted, that some regular form immediately lays claim to
this corrupted matter: and if it were not so, could the world subsist? Must it
not dissolve as well as the animal, and pass through new positions and
situations; till in a great, but finite succession, it fall at last into the
present or some such order?

{#10,pages=185} It is well, replied ^Cleanthes^, you told us, that this
hypothesis was suggested on a sudden, in the course of the argument. Had you had
leisure to examine it, you would soon have perceived the insuperable objections,
to which it is exposed. No form, you say, can subsist, unless it possess those
powers and organs, requisite for its subsistence: some new order or {oe}conomy
must be tried, and so on, without intermission; till at last some order, which
can support and maintain itself, is fallen upon. But according to this
hypothesis, whence arise the many conveniencies and advantages, which men and
all animals possess? Two eyes, two ears, are not absolutely necessary for the
subsistence of the species. Human race might have been propagated and preserved,
without horses, dogs, cows, sheep, and those innumerable fruits and products,
which serve to our satisfaction and enjoyment. If no camels had been created for
the use of man in the sandy deserts of ^Africa^ and ^Arabia^, would the world
have been dissolved? If no loadstone had been framed to give that wonderful and
useful direction to the needle, would human society and the human kind have been
immediately extinguished? Though the maxims of Nature be in general very frugal,
yet instances of this kind are far from being rare; and any one of them is a
sufficient proof of design, and of a benevolent design, which gave rise to the
order and arrangement of the universe.

{#11,pages=186} At least, you may safely infer, said ^Philo^, that the foregoing
hypothesis is so far incomplete and imperfect; which I shall not scruple to
allow. But can we ever reasonably expect greater success in any attempts of this
nature? Or can we ever hope to erect a system of cosmogony, that will be liable
to no exceptions, and will contain no circumstance repugnant to our limited and
imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature? Your theory itself cannot surely
pretend to any such advantage; even though you have run into _Anthropomorphism_,
the better to preserve a conformity to common experience. Let us once more put
it to trial. In all instances which we have ever seen, ideas are copied from
real objects, and are ectypal, not archetypal, to express myself in learned
terms: You reverse this order, and give thought the precedence. In all instances
which we have ever seen, thought has no influence upon matter, except where that
matter is so conjoined with it, as to have an equal reciprocal influence upon
it. No animal can move immediately any thing but the members of its own body;
and indeed, the equality of action and re-action seems to be an universal law of
Nature: But your theory implies a contradiction to this experience. These
instances, with many more, which it were easy to collect, (particularly the
supposition of a mind or system of thought that is eternal, or in other words,
an animal ingenerable and immortal) these instances, I say, may teach, all of
us, sobriety in condemning each other; and let us see, that as no system of this
kind ought ever to be received from a slight analogy, so neither ought any to be
rejected on account of a small incongruity. For that is an inconvenience, from
which we can justly pronounce no one to be exempted.

{#12,pages=186-7} All religious systems, it is confessed, are subject to great
and insuperable difficulties. Each disputant triumphs in his turn; while he
carries on an offensive war, and exposes the absurdities, barbarities, and
pernicious tenets of his antagonist. But all of them, on the whole, prepare a
complete triumph for the _Sceptic_; who tells them, that no system ought ever to
be embraced with regard to such subjects: For this plain reason, that no
absurdity ought ever to be assented to with regard to any subject. A total
suspense of judgement is here our only |reasonable resource. And if every
attack, as is commonly observed, and no defence, among Theologians, is
successful; how complete must be _his_ victory, who remains always, with all
mankind, on the offensive, and has himself no fixed station or abiding city,
which he is ever, on any occasion, obliged to defend?
