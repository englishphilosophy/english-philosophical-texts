{#1,pages=158} ^It^ seems strange to me, said ^=Cleanthes=^, that you, ^=Demea=^,
who are so sincere in the cause of religion, should still maintain the
mysterious, incomprehensible nature of the Deity, and should insist so
strenuously, that he has no manner of likeness or resemblance to human
creatures. The Deity, I can readily allow, possesses many powers and attributes,
of which we can have no comprehension: But if our ideas, so far as they go, be
not just, and adequate, and correspondent to his real nature, I know not what
there is in this subject worth insisting on. Is the name, without any meaning,
of such mighty importance? Or how do you ^Mystics^, who maintain the absolute
incomprehensibility of the Deity, differ from Sceptics or Atheists, who assert,
that the first cause of all is unknown and unintelligible? Their temerity must
be very great, if, after rejecting the production by a mind; I mean, a mind,
resembling the human (for I know of no other) they pretend to assign, with
certainty, any other specific, intelligible cause: And their conscience must be
very scrupulous indeed, if they refuse to call the universal, unknown cause a
God or Deity; and to bestow on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning
epithets, as you shall please to require of them.

{#2,pages=158-9} Who could imagine, replied ^=Demea=^, that ^=Cleanthes=^, the calm,
philosophical ^=Cleanthes=^, would attempt to refute his antagonists, by affixing
a nick-name to them; and like the common bigots and inquisitors of the age, have
recourse to invective and declamation, instead of reasoning? Or does he not
perceive, that these topics are easily retorted, and that ^Anthropomorphite^ is
an appellation as invidious, and implies as dangerous consequences, as the
epithet of ^Mystic^, with which he has honoured us? In reality, ^=Cleanthes=^,
consider what it is you assert, when you represent the Deity as similar to a
human |mind and understanding. What is the soul of man? A composition of various
faculties, passions, sentiments, ideas; united, indeed, into one self or person,
but still distinct from each other. When it reasons, the ideas, which are the
parts of its discourse, arrange themselves in a certain form or order; which is
not preserved entire for a moment, but immediately gives place to another
arrangement. New opinions, new passions, new affections, new feelings arise,
which continually diversify the mental scene, and produce in it the greatest
variety, and most rapid succession imaginable. How is this compatible, with that
perfect immutability and simplicity, which all true Theists ascribe to the
Deity? By the same act, say they, he sees past, present, and future: His love
and his hatred, his mercy and his justice, are one individual operation: He is
entire in every point of space; and complete in every instant of duration. No
succession, no change, no acquisition, no diminution. What he is implies not in
it any shadow of distinction or diversity. And what he is, this moment, he ever
has been, and ever will be, without any new judgement, sentiment, or operation.
He stands fixed in one simple, perfect state; nor can you ever say, with any
propriety, that this act of his is different from that other, or that this
judgement or idea has been lately formed, and will give place, by succession, to
any different judgement or idea.

{#3,pages=159} I can readily allow, said ^=Cleanthes=^, that those who maintain
the perfect simplicity of the Supreme Being, to the extent in which you have
explained it, are complete ^Mystics^, and chargeable with all the consequences
which I have drawn from their opinion. They are, in a word, ^Atheists^, without
knowing it. For though it be allowed, that the Deity possesses attributes, of
which we have no comprehension; yet ought we never to ascribe to him any
attributes, which are absolutely incompatible with that intelligent nature,
essential to him. A mind, whose acts and sentiments and ideas are not distinct
and successive; one, that is wholly simple, and totally immutable; is a mind,
which has no thought, no reason, no will, no sentiment, no love, no hatred; or
in a word, is no mind at all. It is an abuse of terms to give it that
appellation; and we may as well speak of limited extension without figure, or of
number without composition.

{#4,pages=159-60} Pray consider, said ^=Philo=^, whom you are at present
|inveighing against. You are honouring with the appellation of _Atheist_ all the
sound, orthodox divines almost, who have treated of this subject; and you will,
at last be, yourself, found, according to your reckoning, the only sound Theist
in the world. But if idolaters be Atheists, as, I think, may justly be asserted,
and Christian Theologians the same; what becomes of the argument, so much
celebrated, derived from the universal consent of mankind?

{#5,pages=160} But because I know you are not much swayed by names and
authorities, I shall endeavour to show you, a little more distinctly, the
inconveniencies of that Anthropomorphism, which you have embraced; and shall
prove, that there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in
the divine mind, consisting of distinct ideas, differently arranged; in the same
manner as an architect forms in his head the plan of a house which he intends to
execute.

{#6,pages=160} It is not easy, I own, to see, what is gained by this
supposition, whether we judge of the matter by _Reason_ or by _Experience_. We
are still obliged to mount higher, in order to find the cause of this cause,
which you had assigned as satisfactory and conclusive.

{#7,pages=160} If Reason (I mean abstract reason, derived from enquiries _a~priori_)
be not alike mute with regard to all questions concerning cause and
effect; this sentence at least it will venture to pronounce, That a mental
world, or universe of ideas, requires a cause as much, as does a material world,
or universe of objects; and if similar in its arrangement must require a similar
cause. For what is there in this subject, which should occasion a different
conclusion or inference? In an abstract view, they are entirely alike; and no
difficulty attends the one supposition, which is not common to both of them.

{#8,pages=161} Again, when we will needs force _Experience_ to pronounce some
sentence, even on these subjects, which lie beyond her sphere; neither can she
perceive any material difference in this particular, between these two kinds of
worlds, but finds them to be governed by similar principles, and to depend upon
an equal variety of causes in their operations. We have specimens in miniature
of both of them. Our own mind resembles the one: A vegetable or animal body the
other. Let Experience, therefore, judge from these samples. Nothing seems more
delicate with regard to its causes than thought; and as these causes never
operate in two persons after the same manner, so we never find two persons, who
think exactly alike. Nor indeed does the same person think exactly alike at any
two different periods of time. A difference of age, of the disposition of his
body, of weather, of food, of company, of books, of passions; any of these
particulars, or others more minute, are sufficient to alter the curious
machinery of thought, and communicate to it very different movements and
operations. As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal bodies are not more
delicate in their motions, nor depend upon a greater variety or more curious
adjustment of springs and principles.

{#9,pages=161-2} How therefore shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause
of that Being, whom you suppose the Author of Nature, or, according to your
system of Anthropomorphism, the ideal world, into which you trace the material?
Have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another ideal world,
or new intelligent principle? But if we stop, and go no farther; why go so far?
Why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going
on _in~infinitum?_ And after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite
progression? Let us remember the story of the ^Indian^ philosopher and his
elephant. It was never more applicable than to the present subject. If the
material world rests upon a similar ideal world, |this ideal world must rest
upon some other; and so on, without end. It were better, therefore, never to
look beyond the present material world. By supposing it to contain the principle
of its order within itself, we really assert it to be God; and the sooner we
arrive at that divine Being so much the better. When you go one step beyond the
mundane system, you only excite an inquisitive humour, which it is impossible
ever to satisfy.

{#10,pages=162} To say, that the different ideas, which compose the reason of
the Supreme Being, fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature, is
really to talk without any precise meaning. If it has a meaning, I would fain
know, why it is not as good sense to say, that the parts of the material world
fall into order, of themselves, and by their own nature. Can the one opinion be
intelligible, while the other is not so?

{#11,pages=162} We have, indeed, experience of ideas, which fall into order, of
themselves, and without any _known_ cause: But, I am sure, we have a much larger
experience of matter, which does the same; as in all instances of generation and
vegetation, where the accurate analysis of the cause exceeds all human
comprehension. We have also experience of particular systems of thought and of
matter, which have no order; of the first, in madness; of the second, in
corruption. Why then should we think, that order is more essential to one than
the other? And if it requires a cause in both, what do we gain by your system,
in tracing the universe of objects into a similar universe of ideas? The first
step, which we make, leads us on for ever. It were, therefore, wise in us, to
limit all our enquiries to the present world, without looking farther. No
satisfaction can ever be attained by these speculations, which so far exceed the
narrow bounds of human understanding.

{#12,pages=162-3} It was usual with the ^Peripatetics^, you know, ^=Cleanthes=^,
when the cause of any phenomenon was demanded, to have recourse to their
_faculties_ or _occult qualities_, and to say, for instance, that bread
nourished by its nutritive faculty, and senna purged by its purgative: But it
has been discovered, that this subterfuge was nothing but the disguise of
ignorance; and that these philosophers, though less ingenuous, really said the
same thing with the sceptics or the vulgar, who fairly |confessed, that they
knew not the cause of these phenomena. In like manner, when it is asked, what
cause produces order in the ideas of the Supreme Being, can any other reason be
assigned by you, Anthropomorphites, than that it is a _rational_ faculty, and
that such is the nature of the Deity? But why a similar answer will not be
equally satisfactory in accounting for the order of the world, without having
recourse to any such intelligent creator, as you insist on, may be difficult to
determine. It is only to say, that _such_ is the nature of material objects, and
that they are all originally possessed of a _faculty_ of order and proportion.
These are only more learned and elaborate ways of confessing our ignorance; nor
has the one hypothesis any real advantage above the other, except in its greater
conformity to vulgar prejudices.

{#13,pages=163} You have displayed this argument with great emphasis, replied
^=Cleanthes=^: You seem not sensible, how easy it is to answer it. Even in common
life, if I assign a cause for any event; is it any objection, ^=Philo=^, that I
cannot assign the cause of that cause, and answer every new question, which may
incessantly be started? And what philosophers could possibly submit to so rigid
a rule? philosophers, who confess ultimate causes to be totally unknown, and are
sensible, that the most refined principles, into which they trace the phenomena,
are still to them as inexplicable as these phenomena themselves are to the
vulgar. The order and arrangement of nature, the curious adjustment of final
causes, the plain use and intention of every part and organ; all these bespeak
in the clearest language an intelligent cause or author. The heavens and the
earth join in the same testimony: The whole chorus of Nature raises one hymn to
the praises of its creator: You alone, or almost alone, disturb this general
harmony. You start abstruse doubts, cavils, and objections: You ask me, what is
the cause of this cause? I know not; I care not; that concerns not me. I have
found a Deity; and here I stop my enquiry. Let those go farther, who are wiser
or more enterprising.

{#14,pages=163-4} I pretend to be neither, replied ^=Philo=^: and for that very
reason, I should never perhaps have attempted to go so far; especially when I am
sensible, that I must at last be contented to sit down with the same answer,
which, without farther trouble, might have satisfied me from the beginning. |If
I am still to remain in utter ignorance of causes, and can absolutely give an
explication of nothing, I shall never esteem it any advantage to shove off for a
moment a difficulty, which, you acknowledge, must immediately, in its full
force, recur upon me. Naturalists indeed very justly explain particular effects
by more general causes; though these general causes themselves should remain in
the end totally inexplicable: but they never surely thought it satisfactory to
explain a particular effect by a particular cause, which was no more to be
accounted for than the effect itself. An ideal system, arranged of itself,
without a precedent design, is not a whit more explicable than a material one,
which attains its order in a like manner; nor is there any more difficulty in
the latter supposition than in the former.
