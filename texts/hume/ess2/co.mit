{#1,pages=253} THE greater part of mankind may be divided into two classes; that
of _shallow_ thinkers, who fall short of the truth; and that of _abstruse_
thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter class are by far the most rare: and I may
add, by far the most useful and valuable. They suggest hints, at least, and
start difficulties, which they want, perhaps, skill to pursue; but which may
produce fine discoveries, when handled by men who have a more just way of
thinking. At worst, what they say is uncommon; and if it should cost some pains
to comprehend it, one has, however, the pleasure of hearing something that is
new. An author is little to be valued, who tells us nothing but what we can
learn from every coffee-house conversation.

{#2,pages=253-5} All people of _shallow_ thought are apt to decry even those |of
_solid_ understanding, as _abstruse_ thinkers, and metaphysicians, and refiners;
and never will allow any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak
conceptions. There are some cases, I own, where an extraordinary refinement
affords a strong presumption of falsehood, and where no reasoning is to be
trusted but what is natural and easy. When a man deliberates concerning his
conduct in any _particular_ affair, and forms schemes in politics, trade,
{oe}conomy, or any business in life, he never ought to draw his arguments too
fine, or connect too long a chain of consequences together. Something is sure to
happen, that will disconcert his reasoning, and produce an event different from
what he expected. But when we reason upon _general_ subjects, one may justly
affirm, that our speculations can scarcely ever be too fine, provided they be
just; and that the difference between a common man and a man of genius is
chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they
proceed. General reasonings seem intricate, merely because they are general; nor
is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish, in a great number of
particulars, that common circumstance in which they all agree, or to extract it,
pure and unmixed, from the other superfluous circumstances. Every judgment or
conclusion, with them, is particular. They cannot enlarge their view to those
universal propositions, which comprehend under them an infinite number of
individuals, and include a whole science in a single theorem. Their eye is
confounded with such an extensive prospect; and the conclusions, derived from
it, even though clearly expressed, seem intricate and obscure. But however
intricate they may seem, it is certain, that general principles, if just and
sound, must always prevail in the general course of things, though they may fail
in particular cases; and it is the chief business of philosophers to regard the
general course of things. I may add, that it is also the chief business of
politicians; especially in the domestic government of the state, where the
public good, which is, or ought to be their object, depends on the concurrence
of a multitude of causes; not, as |in foreign politics, on accidents and
chances, and the caprices of a few persons. This therefore makes the difference
between _particular_ deliberations and _general_ reasonings, and renders
subtilty and refinement much more suitable to the latter than to the former.

{#3,pages=255} I thought this introduction necessary before the following
discourses on _commerce_, _money_, _interest_, _balance of trade_, _&c._ where,
perhaps, there will occur some principles which are uncommon, and which may seem
too refined and subtile for such vulgar subjects. If false, let them be
rejected: But no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them, merely because
they are out of the common road.

{#4,pages=255-6} The greatness of a state, and the happiness of its subjects,
how independent soever they may be supposed in some respects, are commonly
allowed to be inseparable with regard to commerce; and as private men receive
greater security, in the possession of their trade and riches, from the power of
the public, so the public becomes powerful in proportion to the opulence and
extensive commerce of private men. This maxim is true in general; though I
cannot forbear thinking, that it may possibly admit of exceptions, and that we
often establish it with too little reserve and limitation. There may be some
circumstances, where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals, instead
of adding strength to the public, will serve only to thin its armies, and
diminish its authority among the neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable
being, |and susceptible of many different opinions, principles, and rules of
conduct. What may be true, while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be
found false, when he has embraced an opposite set of manners and opinions.

{#5,pages=256} The bulk of every state may be divided into _husbandmen_ and
_manufacturers_. The former are employed in the culture of the land; the latter
{~~works->work~~} up the materials furnished by the former, into all the
commodities which are necessary or ornamental to human life. As soon as men quit
their savage state, where they live chiefly by hunting and fishing, they must
fall into these two classes; though the arts of agriculture employ _at first_
the most numerous part of the society[n1]. Time and experience improve so much
these arts, that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men, than
those who are immediately employed in its culture, or who furnish the more
necessary manufactures to such as are so employed.

{#6,pages=256-7} If these superfluous hands apply themselves to the finer arts,
which are commonly denominated the arts of _luxury_, they add to the happiness
of the state; since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments,
with which they would otherwise have been unacquainted. But may not another
scheme be proposed for the employment of these superfluous hands? May not the
sovereign lay claim to them, and employ them in fleets and armies, to encrease
the dominions of the state abroad, and spread its fame over distant nations? It
is certain that the fewer desires and wants are found in the proprietors and
labourers of land, the fewer hands do they employ; and consequently the
superfluities of the land, |instead of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers,
may support fleets and armies to a much greater extent, than where a great many
arts are required to minister to the luxury of particular persons. Here
therefore seems to be a kind of opposition between the greatness of the state
and the happiness of the subject. A state is never greater than when all its
superfluous hands are employed in the service of the public. The ease and
convenience of private persons require, that these hands should be employed in
their service. The one can never be satisfied, but at the expence of the other.
As the ambition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals; so
the luxury of individuals must diminish the force, and check the ambition of the
sovereign.

{#7,pages=257-8} Nor is this reasoning merely chimerical; but is founded on
history and experience. The republic of ^Sparta^ was certainly more powerful
than any state now in the world, consisting of an equal number of people; and
this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury. The ^Helotes^ were
the labourers: The ^Spartans^ were the soldiers or gentlemen. It is evident,
that the labour of the ^Helotes^ could not have maintained so great a number of
^Spartans^, had these latter lived in ease and delicacy, and given employment to
a great variety of trades and manufactures. The like policy may be remarked in
^Rome^. And indeed, throughout all ancient history, it is observable, that the
smallest republics raised and maintained greater armies, than states consisting
of triple the number of inhabitants, are able to support at present. It is
computed, that, in all ^European^ nations, the proportion between soldiers and
people does not exceed one to a hundred. But we read, that the city of ^Rome^
alone, with its small territory, raised and maintained, in early times, ten
legions against the ^Latins^. ^Athens^, the whole of whose dominions was not
larger than ^Yorkshire^, sent to the expedition against ^Sicily^ near forty
thousand men[n2]. ^Dionysius^ the elder, it is said, |maintained a standing army
of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse, besides a large fleet of four
hundred sail[n3]; though his territories extended no farther than the city of
^Syracuse^, about a third of the island of ^Sicily^, and some sea-port towns and
garrisons on the coast of ^Italy^ and ^Illyricum^. It is true, the ancient
armies, in time of war, subsisted much upon plunder: But did not the enemy
plunder in their turn? which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than any
other that could be devised. In short, no probable reason can be assigned for
the great power of the more ancient states above the modern, but their want of
commerce and luxury. Few artizans were maintained by the labour of the farmers,
and therefore more soldiers might live upon it. ^Livy^ says, that ^Rome^, in his
time, would find it difficult to raise as large an army as that which, in her
early days, she sent out against the ^Gauls^ and ^Latins^[n4]. Instead of those
soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in ^Camillus^'s time, there were, in
^Augustus^'s days, musicians, painters, cooks, players, and tailors; and if the
land was equally cultivated at both periods, it could certainly maintain equal
numbers in the one profession as in the other. They added nothing to the mere
necessaries of life, in the latter period more than in the former.

{#8,pages=258-9} It is natural on this occasion to ask, whether sovereigns may
not return to the maxims of ancient policy, and consult their own interest in
this respect, more than the happiness of their |subjects? I answer, that it
appears to me, almost impossible; and that because ancient policy was violent,
and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things. It is well known
with what peculiar laws ^Sparta^ was governed, and what a prodigy that republic
is justly esteemed by every one, who has considered human nature as it has
displayed itself in other nations, and other ages. Were the testimony of history
less positive and circumstantial, such a government would appear a mere
philosophical whim or fiction, and impossible ever to be reduced to practice.
And though the ^Roman^ and other ancient republics were supported on principles
somewhat more natural, yet was there an extraordinary concurrence of
circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthens. They were free
states; they were small ones; and the age being martial, all their neighbours
were continually in arms. Freedom naturally begets public spirit, especially in
small states; and this public spirit, this _amor patri{ae}_, must encrease, when
the public is almost in continual alarm, and men are obliged, every moment, to
expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence. A continual
succession of wars makes every citizen a soldier: He takes the field in his
turn: And during his service he is chiefly maintained by himself. This service
is indeed equivalent to a heavy tax; yet is it less felt by a people addicted to
arms, who fight for honour and revenge more than pay, and are unacquainted with
gain and industry as well as pleasure[n5]. Not to mention the great equality of
fortunes among the inhabitants of the ancient republics, where every field,
belonging to a different proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and rendered
the numbers of citizens very considerable, even without trade and manufactures.

{#9,pages=260} But though the want of trade and manufactures, among a free and
very martial people, may _sometimes_ have no other effect than to render the
public more powerful, it is certain, that, in the common course of human
affairs, it will have a quite contrary tendency. Sovereigns must take mankind as
they find them, and cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in their
principles and ways of thinking. A long course of time, with a variety of
accidents and circumstances, are requisite to produce those great revolutions,
which so much diversify the face of human affairs. And the less natural any set
of principles are, which support a particular society, the more difficulty will
a legislator meet with in raising and cultivating them. It is his best policy to
comply with the common bent of mankind, and give it all the improvements of
which it is susceptible. Now, according to the most natural course of things,
industry and arts and trade encrease the power of the sovereign as well as the
happiness of the subjects; and that policy is violent, which aggrandizes the
public by the poverty of individuals. This will easily appear from a few
considerations, which will present to us the consequences of sloth and
barbarity.

{#10,pages=260-1} Where manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated, the
bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture; and if their skill and
industry encrease, there must arise a great superfluity from their labour beyond
what suffices to maintain |them. They have no temptation, therefore, to encrease
their skill and industry; since they cannot exchange that superfluity for any
commodities, which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity. A habit of
indolence naturally prevails. The greater part of the land lies uncultivated.
What is cultivated, yields not its utmost for want of skill and assiduity in the
farmers. If at any time the public exigencies require, that great numbers should
be employed in the public service, the labour of the people furnishes now no
superfluities, by which these numbers can be maintained. The labourers cannot
encrease their skill and industry on a sudden. Lands uncultivated cannot be
brought into tillage for some years. The armies, mean while, must either make
sudden and violent conquests, or disband for want of subsistence. A regular
attack or defence, therefore, is not to be expected from such a people, and
their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and
manufacturers.

{#11,pages=261-2} Every thing in the world is purchased by labour; and our
passions are the only causes of labour. When a nation abounds in manufactures
and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land, as well as the farmers, study
agriculture as a science, and redouble their industry and attention. The
superfluity, which arises from their labour, is not lost; but is exchanged with
manufactures for those commodities, which men's luxury now makes them covet. By
this means, land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life, than
what suffices for those who cultivate it. In times of peace and tranquillity,
this superfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers, and the improvers of
liberal arts. But it is easy for the public to convert many of these
manufacturers into soldiers, and maintain them by that superfluity, which arises
from the labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that this is the case in
all civilized governments. When the sovereign raises an army, what is the
consequence? He imposes a tax. This tax obliges all the people to retrench what
is least necessary to their subsistence. Those, who labour in such commodities,
must either enlist in the troops, or turn themselves to agriculture, and thereby
|oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business. And to consider the
matter abstractedly, manufactures encrease the power of the state only as they
store up so much labour, and that of a kind to which the public may lay claim,
without depriving any one of the necessaries of life. The more labour,
therefore, is employed beyond mere necessaries, the more powerful is any state;
since the persons engaged in that labour may easily be converted to the public
service. In a state without manufactures, there may be the same number of hands;
but there is not the same quantity of labour, nor of the same kind. All the
labour is there bestowed upon necessaries, which can admit of little or no
abatement.

{#12,pages=262} Thus the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the
state are, in a great measure, united with regard to trade and manufactures. It
is a violent method, and in most cases impracticable, to oblige the labourer to
toil, in order to raise from the land more than what subsists himself and
family. Furnish him with manufactures and commodities, and he will do it of
himself. Afterwards you will find it easy to seize some part of his superfluous
labour, and employ it in the public service, without giving him his wonted
return. Being accustomed to industry, he will think this less grievous, than if,
at once, you obliged him to an augmentation of labour without any reward. The
case is the same with regard to the other members of the state. The greater is
the stock of labour of all kinds, the greater quantity may be taken from the
heap, without making any sensible alteration in it.

{#13,pages=262-3} A public granary of corn, a storehouse of cloth, a magazine of
arms; all these must be allowed real {~~riche->riches~~} and strength in any
state. Trade and industry are really nothing but a stock of labour, which, in
times of peace and tranquillity, is employed for the ease and satisfaction of
individuals; but in the exigencies of state, may, in part, be turned to public
advantage. Could we convert a city into a kind of fortified camp, and infuse
into each breast so martial a genius, and such a passion for public good, as to
make every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the
public; these affections |might now, as in ancient times, prove alone a
sufficient spur to industry, and support the community. It would then be
advantageous, as in camps, to banish all arts and luxury; and, by restrictions
on equipage and tables, make the provisions and forage last longer than if the
army were loaded with a number of superfluous retainers. But as these principles
are too disinterested and too difficult to support, it is requisite to govern
men by other passions, and animate them with a spirit of avarice and industry,
art and luxury. The camp is, in this case, loaded with a superfluous retinue;
but the provisions flow in proportionably larger. The harmony of the whole is
still supported; and the natural bent of the mind being more complied with,
individuals, as well as the public, find their account in the observance of
those maxims.

{#14,pages=263} The same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of
_foreign_ commerce, in augmenting the power of the state, as well as the riches
and happiness of the subject. It encreases the stock of labour in the nation;
and the sovereign may convert what share of it he finds necessary to the service
of the public. Foreign trade, by its imports, furnishes materials for new
manufactures; and by its exports, it produces labour in particular commodities,
which could not be consumed at home. In short, a kingdom, that has a large
import and export, must abound more with industry, and that employed upon
delicacies and luxuries, than a kingdom which rests contented with its native
commodities. It is, therefore, more powerful, as well as richer and happier. The
individuals reap the benefit of these commodities, so far as they gratify the
senses and appetites. And the public is also a gainer, while a greater stock of
labour is, by this means, stored up against any public exigency; that is, a
greater number of laborious men are maintained, who may be diverted to the
public service, without robbing any one of the necessaries, or even the chief
conveniencies of life.

{#15,pages=263-4} If we consult history, we shall find, that, in most nations,
foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures, and given birth
to domestic luxury. The temptation |is stronger to make use of foreign
commodities, which are ready for use, and which are entirely new to us, than to
make improvements on any domestic commodity, which always advance by slow
degrees, and never affect us by their novelty. The profit is also very great, in
exporting what is superfluous at home, and what bears no price, to foreign
nations, whose soil or climate is not favourable to that commodity. Thus men
become acquainted with the _pleasures_ of luxury and the _profits_ of commerce;
and their _delicacy_ and _industry_, being once awakened, carry them on to
farther improvements, in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade. And
this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from a commerce with strangers.
It rouses men from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent
part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of,
raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors
enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this
importation and exportation, make great profits; and becoming rivals in wealth
to the ancient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in
commerce. Imitation soon diffuses all those arts; while domestic manufactures
emulate the foreign in their improvements, and work up every home commodity to
the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible. Their own steel and iron, in
such laborious hands, become equal to the gold and rubies of the ^Indies^.

{#16,pages=264} When the affairs of the society are once brought to this
situation, a nation may lose most of its foreign trade, and yet continue a great
and powerful people. If strangers will not take any particular commodity of
ours, we must cease to labour in it. The same hands will turn themselves towards
some refinement in other commodities, which may be wanted at home. And there
must always be materials for them to work upon; till every person in the state,
who possesses riches, enjoys as great plenty of home commodities, and those in
as great perfection, as he desires; which can never possibly happen. ^China^ is
represented as one of the most flourishing empires in the world; though it has
very little commerce beyond its own territories.

{#17,pages=265} It will not, I hope, be considered as a superfluous digression,
if I here observe, that, as the multitude of mechanical arts is advantageous, so
is the great number of persons to whose share the productions of these arts
fall. A too great disproportion among the citizens weakens any state. Every
person, if possible, ought to enjoy the fruits of his labour, in a full
possession of all the necessaries, and many of the conveniencies of life. No one
can doubt, but such an equality is most suitable to human nature, and diminishes
much less from the _happiness_ of the rich than it adds to that of the poor. It
also augments the _power of the state_, and makes any extraordinary taxes or
impositions be paid with more chearfulness. Where the riches are engrossed by a
few, these must contribute very largely to the supplying of the public
necessities. But when the riches are dispersed among multitudes, the burthen
feels light on every shoulder, and the taxes make not a very sensible difference
on any one's way of living.

{#18,pages=265} Add to this, that, where the riches are in few hands, these must
enjoy all the power, and will readily conspire to lay the whole burthen on the
poor, and oppress them still farther, to the discouragement of all industry.

{#19,pages=265-6} In this circumstance consists the great advantage of ^England^
above any nation at present in the world, or that appears in the records of any
story. It is true, the ^English^ feel some disadvantages in foreign trade by the
high price of labour, which is in part the effect of the riches of their
artisans, as well as of the plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the
most material circumstance, it is not to be put in competition with the
happiness of so many millions. And if there were no more to endear to them that
free government under which they live, this alone were sufficient. The poverty
of the common people is a natural, if not an infallible effect of absolute
monarchy; though I doubt, whether it be always true, on the other hand, that
their riches are an infallible result of liberty. Liberty must be attended with
particular accidents, and a certain turn of thinking, in order to produce that
effect. Lord ^Bacon^, accounting for the great advantages obtained by the
^English^ in their wars with ^France^, ascribes them |chiefly to the superior
ease and plenty of the common people amongst the former; yet the government of
the two kingdoms was, at that time, pretty much alike. Where the labourers and
artisans are accustomed to work for low wages, and to retain but a small part of
the fruits of their labour, it is difficult for them, even in a free government,
to better their condition, or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages.
But even where they are accustomed to a more plentiful way of life, it is easy
for the rich, in an arbitrary government, to conspire against them, and throw
the whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders.

{#20,pages=266-7} It may seem an odd position, that the poverty of the common
people in ^France^, ^Italy^, and ^Spain^, is, in some measure, owing to the
superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate; yet there want not
reasons to justify this paradox. In such a fine mould or soil as that of those
more southern regions, agriculture is an easy art; and one man, with a couple of
sorry horses, will be able, in a season, to cultivate as much land as will pay a
pretty considerable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which the farmer knows,
is to leave his ground fallow for a year, as soon as it is exhausted; and the
warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it, and restore
its fertility. Such poor peasants, therefore, require only a simple maintenance
for their labour. They have no stock or riches, which claim more; and at the
same time, they are for ever dependant on their landlord, who gives no leases,
nor fears that his land will be spoiled by the ill methods of cultivation. In
^England^, the land is rich, but coarse; must be cultivated at a great expence;
and produces slender crops, when not carefully managed, and by a method which
gives not the full profit but in a course of several years. A farmer, therefore,
in ^England^ must have a considerable stock, and a long lease; which beget
proportional profits. The fine vineyards of ^Champagne^ and ^Burgundy^, that
often yield to the land|lord above five pounds _per_ acre, are cultivated by
peasants, who have scarcely bread: The reason is, that such peasants need no
stock but their own limbs, with instruments of husbandry, which they can buy for
twenty shillings. The farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those
countries. But the grasiers are most at their ease of all those who cultivate
the land. The reason is still the same. Men must have profits proportionable to
their expence and hazard. Where so considerable a number of the labouring poor
as the peasants and farmers are in very low circumstances, all the rest must
partake of their poverty, whether the government of that nation be monarchical
or republican.

{#21,pages=267} We may form a similar remark with regard to the general history
of mankind. What is the reason, why no people, living between the tropics, could
ever yet attain to any art or civility, or reach even any police in their
government, and any military discipline; while few nations in the temperate
climates have been altogether deprived of these advantages? It is probable that
one cause of this ph{ae}nomenon is the warmth and equality of weather in the
torrid zone, which render clothes and houses less requisite for the inhabitants,
and thereby remove, in part, that necessity, which is the great spur to industry
and invention. _Curis acuens mortalia corda._ Not to mention, that the fewer
goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy, the fewer quarrels are
likely to arise amongst them, and the less necessity will there be for a settled
police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies, or
from each other.

{#n1,pages=256} Mons. ^Melon^, in his political essay on commerce, asserts, that
even at present, if you divide ^France^ into 20 parts, 16 are labourers or
peasants; two only artizans; one belonging to the law, church, and military; and
one merchants, financiers, and bourgeois. This calculation is certainly very
erroneous. In ^France^, ^England^, and indeed most parts of ^Europe^, half of
the inhabitants live in cities; and even of those who live in the country, a
great number are artizans, perhaps above a third.

{#n2,pages=257} ^Thucydides^, lib. vii.

{#n3,pages=258} ^Diod. Sic.^ lib. vii. This account, I own, is somewhat
suspicious, not to say worse; chiefly because this army was not composed of
citizens, but of mercenary forces.

{#n4,pages=258} ^Titi livii^, lib. vii. cap. 24. “Adeo in qu{ae} laboramus,”
says he, “sola crevimus, divitias luxuriemque.”

{#n5} See NOTE [O].

{#n5.1,pages=259-60} THE more ancient ^Romans^ lived in perpetual war with all
their neighbours: And in old ^Latin^, the term _hostis_, expressed both a
stranger and an enemy. This is remarked by ^Cicero^; but by him is ascribed to
the humanity of his ancestors, who softened, as much as possible, the
denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the same appellation which signified
a stranger. _De Off._ lib. ii. It is however much more probable, from the
manners of the times, that the ferocity of those people |was so great as to make
them regard all strangers as enemies, and call them by the same name. It is not,
besides, consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of nature, that any
state should regard its public enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such
sentiments for them as the ^Roman^ orator would ascribe to his ancestors. Not to
mention, that the early ^Romans^ really exercised piracy, as we learn from their
first treaties with ^Carthage^, preserved by ^Polybius^, lib. iii. and
consequently, like the ^Sallee^ and ^Algerine^ rovers, were actually at war with
most nations, and a stranger and an enemy were with them almost synonimous.
