£1 ^Sect. XII.^ _With regard to Doubt or Conviction._ £1

{#1,pages=67} We meet every day with people so sceptical with regard to history,
that they assert it impossible for any nation ever to believe such absurd
principles as those of ^Greek^ and ^Egyptian^ paganism; and at the same time so
dogmatical with regard to religion, that they think the same absurdities are to
be found in no other communion. ^Cambyses^ entertained like prejudices; and very
impiously ridiculed, and even wounded, ^Apis^, the great god of the ^Egyptians^,
who appeared to his profane senses nothing but a large spotted bull. But
^Herodotus^ judiciously ascribes this sally of passion to a real madness or
disorder of the brain: Otherwise, says the historian, he never would have openly
affronted any established worship. For on that head, continues he, every nation
are best satisfied with their own, and think they have the advantage over every
other nation.

{#2,pages=67} It must be allowed, that the ^Roman^ Catholics are a very learned
sect; and that no one communion, but that of the church of ^England^, can
dispute their being the most learned of all the Christian churches: Yet
^Averroes^, the famous ^Arabian^, who, no doubt, had heard of the ^Egyptian^
superstitions, declares, that, of all religions, the most absurd and nonsensical
is that, whose votaries eat, after having created, their deity.

{#3,pages=67} I believe, indeed, that there is no tenet in all paganism, which
would give so fair a scope to ridicule as this of the _real presence:_ For it is
so absurd, that it eludes the force of all argument. There are even some
pleasant stories of that kind, which, though somewhat profane, are commonly told
by the Catholics themselves. One day, a priest, it is said, gave inadvertently,
instead of the sacrament, a counter, which had by accident fallen among the holy
wafers. The communicant waited patiently for some time, expecting it would
dissolve on his tongue: But finding that it still remained entire, he took it
off. _I wish,_ cried he to the priest, _you have not committed some mistake: I
wish you have not given me God the Father: He is so hard and tough there is no
swallowing him._

{#4,pages=67-8} A famous general, at that time in the ^Muscovite^ service,
having come to ^Paris^ for the recovery of his wounds, brought along with him a
young ^Turk^, whom he had taken prisoner. Some of the doctors of the ^Sorbonne^
(who are altogether as positive as the dervises of ^Constantinople^) thinking
|it a pity, that the poor ^Turk^ should be damned for want of instruction,
solicited ^Mustapha^ very hard to turn Christian, and promised him, for his
encouragement, plenty of good wine in this world, and paradise in the next.
These allurements were too powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been
well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of
baptism and the Lord's supper. The priest, however, to make every thing sure and
solid, still continued his instructions; and began the next day with the usual
question, _How many Gods are there?_ _None at all,_ replies ^Benedict^; for that
was his new name. _How! None at all!_ cries the priest. _To be sure,_ said the
honest proselyte. _You have told me all along that there is but one God: And
yesterday I eat him._

{#5,pages=68} Such are the doctrines of our brethren the Catholics. But to these
doctrines we are so accustomed, that we never wonder at them: Though in a future
age, it will probably become difficult to persuade some nations, that any human,
two-legged creature could ever embrace such principles. And it is a thousand to
one, but these nations themselves shall have something full as absurd in their
own creed, to which they will give a most implicit and most religious assent.

{#6,pages=68} I lodged once at ^Paris^ in the same _hotel_ with an ambassador
from ^Tunis^, who, having passed some years at ^London^, was returning home that
way. One day I observed his ^Moorish^ excellency diverting himself under the
porch, with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along; when there
chanced to pass that way some _Capucin_ friars, who had never seen a ^Turk^; as
he, on his part, though accustomed to the ^European^ dresses, had never seen the
grotesque figure of a _Capucin:_ And there is no expressing the mutual
admiration, with which they inspired each other. Had the chaplain of the embassy
entered into a dispute with these ^Franciscans^, their reciprocal surprize had
been of the same nature. Thus all mankind stand staring at one another; and
there is no beating it into their heads, that the turban of the ^African^ is not
just as good or as bad a fashion as the cowl of the ^European^. _He is a very
honest man,_ said the prince of ^Sallee^, speaking of de ^Ruyter^, _It is a pity
he were a Christian._

{#7,pages=68-9} How can you worship leeks and onions? we shall suppose a
^Sorbonnist^ to say to a priest of ^Sais^. If we worship them, replies the
latter; at least, we do not, at the same time, eat them. But what strange
objects of adoration are cats and monkies? says the learned doctor. They are at
least as good as the relics or rotten bones of martyrs, answers his no less
learned antagonist. Are you not mad, insists the Catholic, to cut one another's
throat about the preference of a |cabbage or a cucumber? Yes, says the pagan; I
allow it, if you will confess, that those are still madder, who fight about the
preference among volumes of sophistry, ten thousand of which are not equal in
value to one cabbage or cucumber[n58].

{#8,pages=69} Every by-stander will easily judge (but unfortunately the
by-standers are few) that, if nothing were requisite to establish any popular
system, but exposing the absurdities of other systems, every votary of every
superstition could give a sufficient reason for his blind and bigotted
attachment to the principles in which he has been educated. But without so
extensive a knowledge, on which to ground this assurance (and perhaps, better
without it), there is not wanting a sufficient stock of religious zeal and faith
among mankind. ^Diodorus Siculus^[n59] gives a remarkable instance to this
purpose, of which he was himself an eye-witness. While ^Egypt^ lay under the
greatest terror of the ^Roman^ name, a legionary soldier having inadvertently
been guilty of the sacrilegious impiety of killing a cat, the whole people rose
upon him with the utmost fury; and all the efforts of the prince were not able
to save him. The senate and people of ^Rome^, I am persuaded, would not, then,
have been so delicate with regard to their national deities. They very frankly,
a little after that time, voted ^Augustus^ a place in the celestial mansions;
and would have dethroned every god in heaven, for his sake, had he seemed to
desire it. _Presens divus habebitur ^Augustus^,_ says ^Horace^. That is a very
important point: And in other nations and other ages, the same circumstance has
not been deemed altogether indifferent[n60].

{#9,pages=70} Notwithstanding the sanctity of our holy religion, says
^Tully^[n61], no crime is more common with us than sacrilege: But was it ever
heard of, that an ^Egyptian^ violated the temple of a cat, an ibis, or a
crocodile? There is no torture, an ^Egyptian^ would not undergo, says the same
author in another place[n62], rather than injure an ibis, an aspic, a cat, a
dog, or a crocodile. Thus it is strictly true, what ^Dryden^ observes,
"""Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be, //
Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, //
In his defence his servants are as bold, //
As if he had been born of beaten gold." //
~~~~~~^Absolom^ and ^Achitophel.^""
 Nay, the baser the materials are, of which the divinity is composed, the
greater devotion is he likely to excite in the breasts of his deluded votaries.
They exult in their shame, and make a merit with their deity, in braving, for
his sake, all the ridicule and contumely of his enemies. Ten thousand Crusaders
inlist themselves under the holy banners; and even openly triumph in those parts
of their religion, which their adversaries regard as the most reproachful.

{#10,pages=70} There occurs, I own, a difficulty in the ^Egyptian^ system of
theology; as indeed, few systems of that kind are entirely free from
difficulties. It is evident, from their method of propagation, that a couple of
cats, in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom; and if that religious
veneration were still paid them, it would, in twenty more, not only be easier in
^Egypt^ to find a god than a man, which ^Petronius^ says was the case in some
parts of ^Italy^; but the gods must at last entirely starve the men, and leave
themselves neither priests nor votaries remaining. It is probable, therefore,
that this wise nation, the most celebrated in antiquity for prudence and sound
policy, foreseeing such dangerous consequences, reserved all their worship for
the full-grown divinities, and used the freedom to drown the holy spawn or
little sucking gods, without any scruple or remorse. And thus the practice of
warping the tenets of religion, in order to serve temporal interests, is not, by
any means, to be regarded as an invention of these later ages.

{#11,pages=70-1} The learned, philosophical ^Varro^, discoursing of religion,
pretends not to deliver any thing beyond probabilities and appearances: Such was
his good sense and moderation! But the passionate, the zealous ^Augustin^,
insults the noble ^Roman^ on his scepticism and reserve, and professes the most
thorough belief and assurance[n63]. A heathen poet, however, contemporary |with
the saint, absurdly esteems the religious system of the latter so false, that
even the credulity of children, he says, could not engage them to believe
it[n64].

{#12,pages=71} Is it strange, when mistakes are so common, to find every one
positive and dogmatical? And that the zeal often rises in proportion to the
error? _Moverunt,_ says ^Spartian^, _& ea tempestate, Jud{ae}i bellum quod
vetabantur mutilare genitalia[n65]._

{#13,pages=71} If ever there was a nation or a time, in which the public
religion lost all authority over mankind, we might expect, that infidelity in
^Rome^, during the ^Ciceronian^ age, would openly have erected its throne, and
that ^Cicero^ himself, in every speech and action, would have been its most
declared abettor. But it appears, that, whatever sceptical liberties that great
man might take, in his writings or in philosophical conversation; he yet
avoided, in the common conduct of life, the imputation of deism and profaneness.
Even in his own family, and to his wife ^Terentia^, whom he highly trusted, he
was willing to appear a devout religionist; and there remains a letter,
addressed to her, in which he seriously desires her to offer sacrifice to
^Apollo^ and ^{AE}sculapius^, in gratitude for the recovery of his health[n66].

{#14,pages=71} ^Pompey^'s devotion was much more sincere: In all his conduct,
during the civil wars, he paid a great regard to auguries, dreams, and
prophesies[n67]. ^Augustus^ was tainted with superstition of every kind. As it
is reported of ^Milton^, that his poetical genius never flowed with ease and
abundance in the spring; so ^Augustus^ observed, that his own genius for
dreaming never was so perfect during that season, nor was so much to be relied
on, as during the rest of the year. That great and able emperor was also
extremely uneasy, when he happened to change his shoes, and put the right foot
shoe on the left foot[n68]. In short it cannot be doubted, but the votaries of
the established superstition of antiquity were as numerous in every state, as
those of the modern religion are at present. Its influence was as universal;
though it was not so great. As many people gave their assent to it; though that
assent was not seemingly so strong, precise, and affirmative.

{#15,pages=71-2} We may observe, that, notwithstanding the dogmatical, imperious
style of all superstition, the conviction of the religionists, in all ages, is
more affected than real, and scarcely ever approaches, in any degree, to that
solid belief and persuasion, which governs us in the common affairs of life. Men
dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts which they entertain on such
|subjects: They make a merit of implicit faith; and disguise to themselves their
real infidelity, by the strongest asseverations and most positive bigotry. But
nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and suffers not the obscure,
glimmering light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the strong
impressions, made by common sense and by experience. The usual course of men's
conduct belies their words, and shows, that their assent in these matters is
some unaccountable operation of the mind between disbelief and conviction, but
approaching much nearer to the former than to the latter.

{#16,pages=72} Since, therefore, the mind of man appears of so loose and
unsteady a texture, that, even at present, when so many persons find an interest
in continually employing on it the chissel and the hammer, yet are they not able
to engrave theological tenets with any lasting impression; how much more must
this have been the case in ancient times, when the retainers to the holy
function were so much fewer in comparison? No wonder, that the appearances were
then very inconsistent, and that men, on some occasions, might seem determined
infidels, and enemies to the established religion, without being so in reality;
or at least, without knowing their own minds in that particular.

{#17,pages=72-3} Another cause, which rendered the ancient religions much looser
than the modern, is, that the former were _traditional_ and the latter are
_scriptural_; and the tradition in the former was complex, contradictory, and,
on many occasions, doubtful; so that it could not possibly be reduced to any
standard and canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith. The stories of
the gods were numberless like the popish legends; and though every one, almost,
believed a part of these stories, yet no one could believe or know the whole:
While, at the same time, all must have acknowledged, that no one part stood on a
better foundation than the rest. The traditions of different cities and nations
were also, on many occasions, directly opposite; and no reason could be assigned
for preferring one to the other. And as there was an infinite number of stories,
with regard to which tradition was nowise positive; the gradation was
insensible, from the most fundamental articles of faith, to those loose and
precarious fictions. The pagan religion, therefore, seemed to vanish like a
cloud, whenever one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal. It could never
be ascertained by any fixed dogmas and principles. And though this did not
convert the generality of mankind from so absurd a faith; for when will the
people be reasonable? yet it made them faulter and hesitate more in maintaining
their principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain dispositions of mind,
|some practices and opinions, which had the appearance of determined infidelity.

{#18,pages=73} To which we may add, that the fables of the pagan religion were,
of themselves, light, easy, and familiar; without devils, or seas of brimstone,
or any object that could much terrify the imagination. Who could forbear
smiling, when he thought of the loves of ^Mars^ and ^Venus^, or the amorous
frolics of ^Jupiter^ and ^Pan^? In this respect, it was a true poetical
religion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry.
We find that it has been adopted by modern bards; nor have these talked with
greater freedom and irreverence of the gods, whom they regarded as fictions,
than the ancients did of the real objects of their devotion.

{#19,pages=73} The inference is by no means just, that, because a system of
religion has made no deep impression on the minds of a people, it must therefore
have been positively rejected by all men of common sense, and that opposite
principles, in spite of the prejudices of education, were generally established
by argument and reasoning. I know not, but a contrary inference may be more
probable. The less importunate and assuming any species of superstition appears,
the less will it provoke men's spleen and indignation, or engage them into
enquiries concerning its foundation and origin. This in the mean time is
obvious, that the empire of all religious faith over the understanding is
wavering and uncertain, subject to every variety of humour, and dependent on the
present incidents, which strike the imagination. The difference is only in the
degrees. An ancient will place a stroke of impiety and one of superstition
alternately, throughout a whole discourse[n69]: A modern often thinks in the
same way, though he may be more guarded in his expression.

{#20,pages=73} ^Lucian^ tells us expressly[n70] that whoever believed not the
most ridiculous fables of paganism was deemed by the people profane and impious.
To what purpose, indeed, would that agreeable author have employed the whole
force of his wit and satire against the national religion, had not that religion
been generally believed by his countrymen and contemporaries?

{#21,pages=73-4} ^Livy^[n71] acknowledges as frankly, as any divine would at
present, the common incredulity of his age; but then he condemns it as severely.
|And who can imagine, that a national superstition, which could delude so
ingenious a man, would not also impose on the generality of the people?

{#22,pages=74} The ^Stoics^ bestowed many magnificent and even impious epithets
on their sage; that he alone was rich, free, a king, and equal to the immortal
gods. They forgot to add, that he was not inferior in prudence and understanding
to an old woman. For surely nothing can be more pitiful than the sentiments,
which that sect entertained with regard to religious matters; while they
seriously agree with the common augurs, that, when a raven croaks from the left,
it is a good omen; but a bad one, when a rook makes a noise from the same
quarter. ^Pan{ae}tius^ was the only ^Stoic^, among the ^Greeks^, who so much as
doubted with regard to auguries and divinations[n72]. ^Marcus Antoninus^[n73]
tells us, that he himself had received many admonitions from the gods in his
sleep. It is true, ^Epictetus^[n74] forbids us to regard the language of rooks
and ravens; but it is not, that they do not speak truth: It is only, because
they can foretel nothing but the breaking of our neck or the forfeiture of our
estate; which are circumstances, says he, that nowise concern us. Thus the
^Stoics^ join a philosophical enthusiasm to a religious superstition. The force
of their mind, being all turned to the side of morals, unbent itself in that of
religion[n75].

{#23,pages=74} ^Plato^[n76] introduces ^Socrates^ affirming, that the accusation
of impiety raised against him was owing entirely to his rejecting such fables,
as those of ^Saturn^'s castrating his father ^Uranus^, and ^Jupiter^'s
dethroning ^Saturn^: Yet in a subsequent dialogue[n77], ^Socrates^ confesses,
that the doctrine of the mortality of the soul was the received opinion of the
people. Is there here any contradiction? Yes, surely: But the contradiction is
not in ^Plato^; it is in the people, whose religious principles in general are
always composed of the most discordant parts; especially in an age, when
superstition sate so easy and light upon them[n78].

{#24,pages=75} The same ^Cicero^, who affected, in his own family, to appear a
devout religionist, makes no scruple, in a public court of judicature, of
treating the doctrine of a future state as a ridiculous fable, to which no body
could give any attention[n79]. ^Sallust^[n80] represents ^C{ae}sar^ as speaking
the same language in the open senate[n81].

{#25,pages=75} But that all these freedoms implied not a total and universal
infidelity and scepticism amongst the people, is too apparent to be denied.
Though some parts of the national religion hung loose upon the minds of men,
other parts adhered more closely to them: And it was the chief business of the
sceptical philosophers to show, that there was no more foundation for one than
for the other. This is the artifice of ^Cotta^ in the dialogues concerning the
_nature of the gods_. He refutes the whole system of mythology by leading the
orthodox gradually, from the more momentous stories, which were believed, to the
more frivolous, which every one ridiculed: From the gods to the goddesses; from
the goddesses to the nymphs; from the nymphs to the fawns and satyrs. His
master, ^Carneades^, had employed the same method of reasoning[n82].

{#26,pages=75-6} Upon the whole, the greatest and most observable differences
between a _traditional, mythological_ religion, and a _systematical, scholastic_
one, are two: |The former is often more reasonable, as consisting only of a
multitude of stories, which, however groundless, imply no express absurdity and
demonstrative contradiction; and sits also so easy and light on men's mind,
that, though it may be as universally received, it happily makes no such deep
impression on the affections and understanding.

{#n58} See NOTE [CCC].

{#n58.1,pages=69} IT is strange that the ^Egyptian^ religion, though so absurd,
should yet have borne so great a resemblance to the ^Jewish^, that ancient
writers even of the greatest genius were not able to observe any difference
between them. For it is remarkable that both ^Tacitus^, and ^Suetonius^, when
they mention that decree of the senate, under ^Tiberius^, by which the
^Egyptian^ and ^Jewish^ proselytes were banished from ^Rome^, expressly treat
these religions as the same; and it appears, that even the decree itself was
founded on that supposition. "Actum & de sacris ^{AE}gyptiis^, ^Judaicisque^
pellendis; factumque patrum consultum, ut quatuor millia libertini generis _ea
superstitione_ infecta, quis idonea {ae}tas, in insulam Sardiniam veherentur,
coercendis illic latrociniis; & si ob gravitatem c{oe}li interissent, _vile
damnum:_ Ceteri cederent ^Italia^, nisi certam ante diem profanos ritus
exuissent." {~~Tacit.->^Tacit.^~~} ann. lib. ii, c. 85. "Externas c{ae}remonias,
^{AE}gyptios^, ^Judaicosque^ ritus compescuit; coactus qui _superstitione ea_
tenebantur, religiosas vestes cum instrumento omni comburere, &c." ^Sueton.
Tiber.^ c. 36. These wise heathens, observing something in the general air, and
genius, and spirit of the two religions to be the same, esteemed the differences
of their dogmas too frivolous to deserve any attention.

{#n60,pages=69} When ^Louis^ the XIVth took on himself the protection of the
Jesuits' College of ^Clermont^, the society ordered the king's arms to be put up
over the gate, and took down the cross, in order to make way for it: Which gave
occasion to the following epigram: //
~~Sustulit hinc Christi, posuitque insignia Regis: //

madness to provoke still farther that deity? The same observation may be made

{#n78.1,pages=74-5} XENOPHON's conduct, as related by himself, is, at once, an
incontestable proof of the general credulity of mankind in those ages, and the
incoherencies, in all ages, of men's opinions in religious matters. That great
captain and philosopher, the disciple of ^Socrates^, and one who has delivered
some of the most refined sentiments with regard to a deity, gave all the
following marks of vulgar, pagan superstition. By ^Socrates^'s advice, he
consulted the oracle of ^Delphi^, before he would engage in the expedition of
^Cyrus^. De exped. lib. iii. p. 294. ex edit Leuncl. Sees a dream the night
after the generals were seized; which he pays great regard to, but thinks
ambiguous. Id. p. 295. He and the whole army regard sneezing as a very lucky
omen. Id. p. 300. Has another dream, when he comes to the river ^Centrites^,
which his fellow-general, ^Chirosophus^, also pays great regard to. Id. lib. iv.
p. 323. The ^Greeks^, suffering from a cold north wind, sacrifice to it; and the
historian observes, that it immediately abated. Id. p. 329. ^Xenophon^ consults
the sacrifices in |secret, before he would form any resolution with himself
about settling a colony. Lib. v. p. 359. He was himself a very skilful augur.
Id. p. 361. Is determined by the victims to refuse the sole command of the army
which was offered him. Lib. vi. p. 273. ^Cleander^, the ^Spartan^, though very
desirous of it, refuses it for the same reason. Id. p. 392. ^Xenophon^ mentions
an old dream with the interpretation given him, when he first joined ^Cyrus^, p.
373. Mentions also the place of ^Hercules^'s descent into hell as believing it,
and says the marks of it are still remaining. Id. p. 375. Had almost starved the
army, rather than lead them to the field against the auspices. Id. p. 382, 383.
His friend, ^Euclides^, the augur, would not believe that he had brought no
money from the expedition; till he (^Euclides^) sacrificed, and then he saw the
matter clearly in the Exta. Lib. vii. p. 425. The same philosopher, proposing a
project of mines for the encrease of the ^Athenian^ revenues, advises them first
to consult the oracle. De rat. red. p. 392. That all this devotion was not a
farce, in order to serve a political purpose, appears both from the facts
themselves, and from the genius of that age, when little or nothing could be
gained by hypocrisy. Besides, ^Xenophon^, as appears from his Memorabilia, was a
kind of heretic in those times, which no political devotee ever is. It is for
the same reason, I maintain, that ^Newton^, ^Locke^, ^Clarke^, &c. being
_Arians_ or _Socinians_, were very sincere in the creed they professed: And I
always oppose this argument to some libertines, who will needs have it, that it
was impossible but that these philosophers must have been hypocrites.

{#n81,pages=75} ^Cicero^ (Tusc. Qu{ae}st.) lib. i. cap. 5, 6. and ^Seneca^

woman so ridiculous as to believe the poets in their accounts of a future state.
Why then does ^Lucretius^ so highly exalt his master for freeing us from these
terrors? Perhaps the generality of mankind were then in the disposition of
^Cephalus^ in ^Plato^ (de Rep. lib. i.) who while he was young and healthful
could ridicule these stories; but as soon as he became old and infirm, began to
entertain apprehensions of their truth. This we may observe not to be unusual
even at present.
