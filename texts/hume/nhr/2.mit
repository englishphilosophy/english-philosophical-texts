£1 ^Sect. II.^ _Origin of Polytheism._ £1

{#1,pages=37} If we would, therefore, indulge our curiosity, in enquiring
concerning the origin of religion, we must turn our thoughts towards polytheism,
the primitive religion of uninstructed mankind.

{#2,pages=37} Were men led into the apprehension of invisible, intelligent power
by a contemplation of the works of nature, they could never possibly entertain
any conception but of one single being, who bestowed existence and order on this
vast machine, and adjusted all its parts, according to one regular plan or
connected system. For though, to persons of a certain turn of mind, it may not
appear altogether absurd, that several independent beings, endowed with superior
wisdom, might conspire in the contrivance and execution of one regular plan; yet
is this a merely arbitrary supposition, which, even if allowed possible, must be
confessed neither to be supported by probability nor necessity. All things in
the universe are evidently of a piece. Every thing is adjusted to every thing.
One design prevails throughout the whole. And this uniformity leads the mind to
acknowledge one author; because the conception of different authors, without any
distinction of attributes or operations, serves only to give perplexity to the
imagination, without bestowing any satisfaction on the understanding. The statue
of ^Laocoon^, as we learn from ^Pliny^, was the work of three artists: But it is
certain, that, were we not told so, we should never have imagined, that a groupe
of figures, cut from one stone, and united in one plan, was not the work and
contrivance of one statuary. To ascribe any single effect to the combination of
several causes, is not surely a natural and obvious supposition.

{#3,pages=37-8} On the other hand, if, leaving the works of nature, we trace the
footsteps of invisible power in the various and contrary events of human life,
we are necessarily led into polytheism and to the acknowledgment of several
limited and imperfect deities. Storms and tempests ruin what is nourished by the
sun. The sun destroys what is fostered by the moisture of dews and rains. War
may be favourable to a nation, whom the inclemency of the seasons afflicts with
famine. Sickness and pestilence may depopulate a kingdom, amidst the most
profuse plenty. The same nation is not, at the same time, equally successful by
sea and by land. And a nation, which now triumphs over its enemies, may anon
submit to their more prosperous arms. In short, |the conduct of events, or what
we call the plan of a particular providence, is so full of variety and
uncertainty, that, if we suppose it immediately ordered by any intelligent
beings, we must acknowledge a contrariety in their designs and intentions, a
constant combat of opposite powers, and a repentance or change of intention in
the same power, from impotence or levity. Each nation has its tutelar deity.
Each element is subjected to its invisible power or agent. The province of each
god is separate from that of another. Nor are the operations of the same god
always certain and invariable. To-day he protects: To-morrow he abandons us.
Prayers and sacrifices, rites and ceremonies, well or ill performed, are the
sources of his favour or enmity, and produce all the good or ill fortune, which
are to be found amongst mankind.

{#4,pages=38} We may conclude, therefore, that, in all nations, which have
embraced polytheism, the first ideas of religion arose not from a contemplation
of the works of nature, but from a concern with regard to the events of life,
and from the incessant hopes and fears, which actuate the human mind.
Accordingly, we find, that all idolaters, having separated the provinces of
their deities, have recourse to that invisible agent, to whose authority they
are immediately subjected, and whose province it is to superintend that course
of actions, in which they are, at any time, engaged. ^Juno^ is invoked at
marriages; ^Lucina^ at births. ^Neptune^ receives the prayers of seamen; and
^Mars^ of warriors. The husbandman cultivates his field under the protection of
^Ceres^; and the merchant acknowledges the authority of ^Mercury^. Each natural
event is supposed to be governed by some intelligent agent; and nothing
prosperous or adverse can happen in life, which may not be the subject of
peculiar prayers or thanksgivings[n1].

{#5,pages=38-9} It must necessarily, indeed, be allowed, that, in order to carry
men's attention beyond the present course of things, or lead them into any
inference concerning invisible intelligent power, they must be actuated by some
passion, which prompts their thought and reflection; some motive, which urges
their first enquiry. But what passion shall we here have recourse to, for
explaining an effect of such mighty consequence? Not speculative curiosity
surely, or the pure love of truth. That motive is too refined for such gross
apprehensions; and would lead men into enquiries concerning |the frame of
nature, a subject too large and comprehensive for their narrow capacities. No
passions, therefore, can be supposed to work upon such barbarians, but the
ordinary affections of human life; the anxious concern for happiness, the dread
of future misery, the terror of death, the thirst of revenge, the appetite for
food and other necessaries. Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature,
especially the latter, men scrutinize, with a trembling curiosity, the course of
future causes, and examine the various and contrary events of human life. And in
this disordered scene, with eyes still more disordered and astonished, they see
the first obscure traces of divinity.

{#n1.1,pages=38} “FRAGILIS & laboriosa mortalitas in partes ista digessit,
infirmitatis su{ae} memor, ut portionibus quisquis coleret, quo maxime
indigeret.” ^Plin.^ lib. ii. cap. 7. So early as ^Hesiod^'s time there were
30,000 deities. _Oper. & Dier._ lib. i. ver. 250. But the task to be performed
by these seems still too great for their number. The provinces of the deities
were so subdivided, that there was even a God of _Sneezing_. See ^Arist.^
_Probl._ sect. 33. cap. 7. The province of copulation, suitably to the
importance and dignity of it, was divided among several deities.
