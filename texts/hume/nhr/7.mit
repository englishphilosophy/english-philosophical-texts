{#1,pages=56} It appears certain, that, though the original notions of the
vulgar represent the Divinity as a limited being, and consider him only as the
particular cause of health or sickness; plenty or want; prosperity or adversity;
yet when more magnificent ideas are urged upon them, they esteem it dangerous to
refuse their assent. Will you say, that your deity is finite and bounded in his
perfections; may be overcome by a greater force; is subject to human passions,
pains, and infirmities; has a beginning, and may have an end? This they dare not
affirm; but thinking it safest to comply with the higher encomiums, they
endeavour, by an affected ravishment and devotion, to ingratiate themselves with
him. As a confirmation of this, we may observe, that the assent of the vulgar
is, in this case, merely verbal, and that they are incapable of conceiving those
sublime qualities, which they seemingly attribute to the Deity. Their real idea
of him, notwithstanding their pompous language, is still as poor and frivolous
as ever.

{#2,pages=56-7} That original intelligence, say the ^Magians^, who is the first
principle of all things, discovers himself _immediately_ to the mind and
understanding alone; but has placed the sun as his image in the visible
universe; and when that bright luminary diffuses its beams over the earth and
the firmament, it is a faint copy of the glory, which resides in the higher
heavens. If you would escape the displeasure of this divine being, you must be
careful never to set your bare foot upon the ground, nor spit into a fire, nor
throw any water upon it, even though it were consuming a whole city[n39]. Who
can express the perfections of the Almighty? say the Mahometans. Even the
noblest of his works, if compared to him, are but dust and rubbish. How much
more must human conception fall short of his infinite perfections? His smile and
favour renders men for ever happy; and to obtain it for your children, the best
method is to cut off from them, while infants, a little bit of skin, about half
the breadth of a farthing. Take two bits of cloth[n40], say the _Roman
catholics_, about an inch or an inch and a half square, join them by the corners
with two strings or pieces of tape about sixteen inches long, throw this over
your head, and make one of the bits of cloth lie upon your |breast, and the
other upon your back, keeping them next your skin: There is not a better secret
for recommending yourself to that infinite Being, who exists from eternity to
eternity.

{#3,pages=57} The ^Getes^, commonly called immortal, from their steady belief of
the soul's immortality, were genuine theists and unitarians. They affirmed
^Zamolxis^, their deity, to be the only true god; and asserted the worship of
all other nations to be addressed to mere fictions and chimeras. But were their
religious principles any more refined, on account of these magnificent
pretensions? Every fifth year they sacrificed a human victim, whom they sent as
a messenger to their deity, in order to inform him of their wants and
necessities. And when it thundered, they were so provoked, that, in order to
return the defiance, they let fly arrows at him, and declined not the combat as
unequal. Such at least is the account, which ^Herodotus^ gives of the theism of
the immortal ^Getes^[n41].
