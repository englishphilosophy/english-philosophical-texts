{#1,pages=40} We are placed in this world, as in a great theatre, where the true
springs and causes of every event are entirely concealed from us; nor have we
either sufficient wisdom to foresee, or power to prevent those ills, with which
we are continually threatened. We hang in perpetual suspence between life and
death, health and sickness, plenty and want; which are distributed amongst the
human species by secret and unknown causes, whose operation is oft unexpected,
and always unaccountable. These _unknown causes_, then, become the constant
object of our hope and fear; and while the passions are kept in perpetual alarm
by an anxious expectation of the events, the imagination is equally employed in
forming ideas of those powers, on which we have so entire a dependance. Could
men anatomize nature, according to the most probable, at least the most
intelligible philosophy, they would find, that these causes are nothing but the
particular fabric and structure of the minute parts of their own bodies and of
external objects; and that, by a regular and constant machinery, all the events
are produced, about which they are so much concerned. But this philosophy
exceeds the comprehension of the ignorant multitude, who can only conceive the
_unknown causes_ in a general and confused manner; though their imagination,
perpetually employed on the same subject, must labour to form some particular
and distinct idea of them. The more they consider these causes themselves, and
the uncertainty of their operation, the less satisfaction do they meet with in
their researches; and, however unwilling, they must at last have abandoned so
arduous an attempt, were it not for a propensity in human nature, which leads
into a system, that gives them some satisfaction.

{#2,pages=40-1} There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all
beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities, with
which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately
conscious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a
natural propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe
malice or good-will to every thing, that hurts or pleases us. Hence the
frequency and beauty of the _prosopop{oe}ia_ in poetry; where trees, mountains
and streams are personified, and the inanimate parts of nature acquire sentiment
and passion. And though these poetical figures and expressions gain not on |the
belief, they may serve, at least, to prove a certain tendency in the
imagination, without which they could neither be beautiful nor natural. Nor is a
river-god or hamadryad always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary personage;
but may sometimes enter into the real creed of the ignorant vulgar; while each
grove or field is represented as possessed of a particular _genius_ or invisible
power, which inhabits and protects it. Nay, philosophers cannot entirely exempt
themselves from this natural frailty; but have oft ascribed to inanimate matter
the horror of a _vacuum_, sympathies, antipathies, and other affections of human
nature. The absurdity is not less, while we cast our eyes upwards; and
transferring, as is too usual, human passions and infirmities to the deity,
represent him as jealous and revengeful, capricious and partial, and, in short,
a wicked and foolish man, in every respect but his superior power and authority.
No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such an absolute ignorance of
causes, and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future fortune,
should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers, possessed of
sentiment and intelligence. The _unknown causes_, which continually employ their
thought, appearing always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be of the
same kind or species. Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought and
reason and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to
bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves.

{#3,pages=41-2} In proportion as any man's course of life is governed by
accident, we always find, that he encreases in superstition; as may particularly
be observed of gamesters and sailors, who, though, of all mankind, the least
capable of serious reflection, abound most in frivolous and superstitious
apprehensions. The gods, says ^Coriolanus^ in ^Dionysius^[n2], have an influence
in every affair; but above all, in war; where the event is so uncertain. All
human life, especially before the institution of order and good government,
being subject to fortuitous accidents; it is natural, that superstition should
prevail every where in barbarous ages, and put men on the most earnest enquiry
concerning those invisible powers, who dispose of their happiness or misery.
Ignorant of astronomy and the anatomy of plants and animals, and too little
curious to observe the admirable adjustment of final causes; they remain still
unacquainted with a first and supreme creator, and with that infinitely perfect
spirit, who alone, by his almighty will, bestowed order on the whole frame of
nature. Such a magnificent idea is too big for their narrow conceptions, which
can neither observe the beauty of the work, nor comprehend the grandeur of its
author. They suppose their deities, |however potent and invisible, to be nothing
but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised from among mankind, and
retaining all human passions and appetites, together with corporeal limbs and
organs. Such limited beings, though masters of human fate, being, each of them,
incapable of extending his influence every where, must be vastly multiplied, in
order to answer that variety of events, which happen over the whole face of
nature. Thus every place is stored with a crowd of local deities; and thus
polytheism has prevailed, and still prevails, among the greatest part of
uninstructed mankind[n3].

{#4,pages=42} Any of the human affections may lead us into the notion of
invisible, intelligent power; hope as well as fear, gratitude as well as
affliction: But if we examine our own hearts, or observe what passes around us,
we shall find, that men are much oftener thrown on their knees by the melancholy
than by the agreeable passions. Prosperity is easily received as our due, and
few questions are asked concerning its cause or author. It begets cheerfulness
and activity and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every social and sensual
pleasure: And during this state of mind, men have little leisure or inclination
to think of the unknown invisible regions. On the other hand, every disastrous
accident alarms us, and sets us on enquiries concerning the principles whence it
arose: Apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity: And the mind, sunk into
diffidence, terror, and melancholy, has recourse to every method of appeasing
those secret intelligent powers, on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to
depend.

{#5,pages=42-3} No topic is more usual with all popular divines than to display
the advantages of affliction, in bringing men to a due sense of religion; by
subduing their confidence and sensuality, which, in times of prosperity, make
them forgetful of a divine providence. Nor is this topic confined merely to
modern religions. The ancients have also employed it. _Fortune has never
liberally, without envy,_ says a ^Greek^ historian[n4], _bestowed an |unmixed
happiness on mankind; but with all her gifts has ever conjoined some disastrous
circumstance, in order to chastize men into a reverence for the gods, whom, in a
continued course of prosperity, they are apt to neglect and forget_.

{#6,pages=43} What age or period of life is the most addicted to superstition?
The weakest and most timid. What sex? The same answer must be given. _The
leaders and examples of every kind of superstition,_ says ^Strabo^[n5], _are the
women. These excite the men to devotion and supplications, and the observance of
religious days. It is rare to meet with one that lives apart from the females,
and yet is addicted to such practices. And nothing can, for this reason, be more
improbable, than the account given of an order of men among the ^Getes^, who
practised celibacy, and were notwithstanding the most religious fanatics._ A
method of reasoning, which would lead us to entertain a bad idea of the devotion
of monks; did we not know by an experience, not so common, perhaps, in
^Strabo^'s days, that one may practise celibacy, and profess chastity; and yet
maintain the closest connexions and most entire sympathy with that timorous and
pious sex.

{#n3,pages=42} The following lines of ^Euripides^ are so much to the present
purpose, that I cannot forbear quoting them: //
~~~~$Ουκ εστιν ουδεν πιςτον, ουτ ευδοξια,$ //
~~$Ουτ' αν καλως πρασσοντα μη πραξειν κακως.$ //
~~$Φυρουσι δ'αυθ'οι θεοι παλιν τε και προσω,$ //
~~$Ταραγμον εντιθεντες, ως αγνωσια$ //
~~$Σεβωμεν αυτους.$ ~~~~~~~~^Hecuba^. //
~~"There is nothing secure in the world; no glory, no prosperity. The gods toss
all life into confusion; mix every thing with its reverse; that all of us, from
our ignorance and uncertainty, may pay them the more worship and reverence."
