{#1,pages=xxxi} IT is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without
vanity; therefore, I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity
that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative shall contain little
more than the History of my Writings; as, indeed, almost all my life has been
spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The first success of most of my
writings was not such as to be an object of vanity.

{#2,pages=xxxii} I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I
was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch
of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been proprietors of the
estate, which my brother possesses, for several generations. My mother was
daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College of Justice: the title
of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother.

{#3,pages=xxxii-iii} My family, however, was not rich, and being myself a
younger brother, my patrimony, according to the mode of my country, was of
course very slender. My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was
an infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our
mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and handsome, devoted
herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I passed through
the ordinary course of education with success, and was seized very early with a
passion for |literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the
great source of my enjoyments. My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my
industry, gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me;
but I found an insurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of
philosophy and general learning; and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet
and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring.

{#4,pages=xxxiii-iv} My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this
plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I
was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering into a
more active scene of life. In 1734, I went to Bristol, with some recommendations
to several eminent merchants, but in a few months found that scene totally
unsuitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of pros|ecuting my studies
in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have steadily
and successfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my
deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard
every object as contemptible, except the improvements of my talents in
literature.

{#5,pages=xxxiv} During my retreat in France, first at Rheims, but chiefly at La
Fleche, in Anjou, I composed my _Treatise of Human Nature_. After passing three
years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In the end
of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down to my mother and my
brother, who lived at his country-house, and was employing himself very
judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune.

{#6,pages=xxxiv} Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of
Human Nature. It fell _dead-born from the press_, without reaching such
distinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally
of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I very soon recovered the blow, and
prosecuted with great ardor my studies in the country. In 1742, I printed at
Edinburgh the first part of my Essays: the work was favorably received, and soon
made me entirely forget my former disappointment. I continued with my mother and
brother in the country, and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek
language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.

{#7,pages=xxxiv-v} In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale,
inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found also, that the friends
and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and
direction, for the state of his mind and health required it. —I lived with him a
twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a considerable accession to
my small fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend
him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada,
|but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I
received an invitation from the general to attend him in the same station in is
military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of
an officer, and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the General,
along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, now General Grant. These two
years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during
the course of my life: I passed them agreeably, and in good company; and my
appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune, which I called
independent, though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so; in
short I was now master of near a thousand pounds.

{#8,pages=xxxv} I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in
publishing the Treatise of Human Nature had proceeded more from the manner than
the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to
the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of that work anew in the
Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, which was published while I was at
Turin. But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of
Human Nature. On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all
England in a ferment on account of Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry, while my
performance was entirely overlooked and neglected. A new edition, which had been
published at London of my Essays, moral and political, met not with a much
better reception.

{#9,pages=xxxv-vi} Such is the force of natural temper, that these
disappointments made little or no impression on me. I went down in 1749, and
lived two years with my brother at his country-house, for my mother was now
dead. I there composed the |second part of my Essays, which I called Political
Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which is
another part of my Treatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile, my bookseller, A.
Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfortunate
Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation; that the sale of
them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were demanded. Answers by
Reverends, and Right Reverends, came out two or three in a year; and I found, by
Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good
company. However, I had fixed a resolution, which I inflexibly maintained, never
to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily
kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising
reputation gave me encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to see the
favorable than unfavorable side of things; a turn of mind which it is more happy
to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year.

{#10,pages=xxxvi} In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true
scene for a man of letters. In 1752, were published at Edinburgh, where I then
lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the
first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year was
published at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in
my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings,
historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best. It came unnoticed
and unobserved into the world.

{#11,pages=xxxvi-vii} In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their
librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which
gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the
History of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a
narrative through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the accession of the
House of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the misrepresentations of faction
began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the
success of this work. |I thought that I was the only historian, that had at once
neglected present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular
prejudices; and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected
proportional applause. But miserable was my disappointment: I was assailed by
one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch, and
Irish, Whig, and Tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist,
patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man, who had presumed to
shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Strafford; and
after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more
mortifying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me that in a
twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed, heard of
one man in the three kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could
indure the book. I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the
primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified
prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged.

{#12,pages=xxxvii} I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war
been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly
retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my name, and
never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now
practicable, and the subsequent volume was considerably advanced, I resolved to
pick up courage and to persevere.

{#13,pages=xxxvii} In this interval, I published at London my Natural History of
Religion, along with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather
obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the
illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility, which distinguish the
Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise
indifferent reception of my performance.

{#14,pages=xxxvii-viii} In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume,
was |published the second volume of my History, containing the period from the
death of Charles I. till the revolution. This performance happened to give less
displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but
helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.

{#15,pages=xxxviii} But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig
party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in
literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that
in above a hundred alterations, which further study, reading, or reflection
engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of
them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English
constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty.

{#16,pages=xxxviii} In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor. The
clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the history of
the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I
was now callous against the impressions of public folly, and continued very
peaceably and contentedly, in my retreat at Edinburgh, to finish, in two
volumes, the more early part of the English History, which I gave to the public
in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable success.

{#17,pages=xxxviii-ix} But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons,
to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances,
that the copy-money given me by the booksellers, much exceeded any thing
formerly known in England; I was become not only independent, but opulent. I
retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to set my foot
out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to
one great man, or even making advances of friendship to any of them. As I was
now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this
philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of
Hertford, with whom I was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his
embassy to Paris, with |a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the
embassy; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This
offer, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was reluctant to
begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid that the civilities
and gay company of Paris, would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and
humour: but on his lordship's repeating the invitation, I accepted of it. I have
every reason, both of pleasure and interest, to think myself happy in my
connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother, General
Conway.

{#18,pages=xxxix} Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will
never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks
and stations. The more I recoiled from their excessive civilities, the more I
was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris,
from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that
city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there
for life.

{#19,pages=xxxix-xl} I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in summer
1765, Lord Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was
_chargé d' affaires_ till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards the end
of the year. In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next summer went to
Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly, of burying myself in a philosophical
retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a
much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's friendship, than I left it; and
I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made
an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an
invitation to be Under-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the
person, and my connexions with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining. I
|returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very opulent (for I possessed a revenue of 1000
pounds a year), healthy, and, though somewhat stricken in years, with the
prospect of enjoying long my ease, and of seeing the increase of my reputation.

{#20,pages=xl} In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which
at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and
incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little
pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the great
decline of my person, never suffered a moment's abatement of my spirits;
insomuch, that were I to name a period of my life, which I should most choose to
pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the
same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider,
besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of
infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking
out at last with additional luster, I knew that I could have but few years to
enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present.

{#21,pages=xl-i} To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or rather
was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens
me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of mild disposition, of
command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of
attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my
passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my
temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was not
unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary;
and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no
reason to be displeased with the |reception I met with from them. In a word,
though most men any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of calumny, I
never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly
exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to
be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to
vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct: not but that the
zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any
story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought would
wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this
funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a
matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained. April 18,
1776.
