£1 Of ^Tragedy^. £1

{#1,pages=216-7} IT seems an unaccountable pleasure, which the spectators of a
well-written tragedy receive from sorrow, terror, anxiety, and other passions,
that are in themselves disagreeable and uneasy. The more they are touched and
affected, the more are they delighted with the spectacle; and as soon as the
uneasy passions cease to operate, the piece is at an end. One scene of full joy
and contentment and security is the utmost, that any composition of this kind
can bear; and it is sure always to be the concluding one. If, in the texture of
the piece, there be interwoven any scenes of satisfaction, they afford only
faint gleams of pleasure, which are thrown in by way of variety, and in order to
plunge the actors into deeper distress, by means of that contrast and
disappointment. The whole art of the poet |is employed, in rouzing and
supporting the compassion and indignation, the anxiety and resentment of his
audience. They are pleased in proportion as they are afflicted, and never are so
happy as when they employ tears, sobs, and cries to give vent to their sorrow,
and relieve their heart, swoln with the tenderest sympathy and compassion.

{#2,pages=217} The few critics who have had some tincture of philosophy, have
remarked this singular ph{ae}nomenon, and have endeavoured to account for it.

{#3,pages=217} L'Abbe ^Dubos^, in his reflections on poetry and painting,
asserts, that nothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the languid,
listless state of indolence, into which it falls upon the removal of all passion
and occupation. To get rid of this painful situation, it seeks every amusement
and pursuit; business, gaming, shews, executions; whatever will rouze the
passions, and take its attention from itself. No matter what the passion is: Let
it be disagreeable, afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is still better than
that insipid languor, which arises from perfect tranquillity and repose.

{#4,pages=217} It is impossible not to admit this account, as being, at least in
part, satisfactory. You may observe, when there are several tables of gaming,
that all the company run to those, where the deepest play is, even though they
find not there the best players. The view, or, at least, imagination of high
passions, arising from great loss or gain, affects the spectator by sympathy,
gives him some touches of the same passions, and serves him for a momentary
entertainment. It makes the time pass the easier with him, and is some relief to
that oppression, under which men commonly labour, when left entirely to their
own thoughts and meditations.

{#5,pages=217-8} We find that common liars always magnify, in their narrations,
all kinds of danger, pain, distress, sickness, deaths, murders, and cruelties;
as well as joy, beauty, mirth, and |magnificence. It is an absurd secret, which
they have for pleasing their company, fixing their attention, and attaching them
to such marvellous relations, by the passions and emotions, which they excite.

{#6,pages=218} There is, however, a difficulty in applying to the present
subject, in its full extent, this solution, however ingenious and satisfactory
it may appear. It is certain, that the same object of distress, which pleases in
a tragedy, were it really set before us, would give the most unfeigned
uneasiness; though it be then the most effectual cure to languor and indolence.
Monsieur ^Fontenelle^ seems to have been sensible of this difficulty; and
accordingly attempts another solution of the ph{ae}nomenon; at least makes some
addition to the theory above mentioned[n1].

{#7,pages=218-9} "Pleasure and pain," says he, "which are two sentiments so
different in themselves, differ not so much in their cause. From the instance of
tickling, it appears, that the movement of pleasure, pushed a little too far,
becomes pain; and that the movement of pain, a little moderated, becomes
pleasure. Hence it proceeds, that there is such a thing as a sorrow, soft and
agreeable: It is a pain weakened and diminished. The heart likes naturally to be
moved and affected. Melancholy objects suit it, and even disastrous and
sorrowful, provided they are softened by some circumstance. It is certain, that,
on the theatre, the representation has almost the effect of reality; yet it has
not altogether that effect. However we may be hurried away by the spectacle;
whatever dominion the senses and imagination may usurp over the reason, there
still lurks at the bottom a certain idea of falsehood in the whole of what we
see. This idea, though weak and disguised, suffices to diminish the pain which
we suffer from the misfortunes of those whom we love, and to reduce that
affliction to such a pitch as converts it into a pleasure. We weep for the
misfortune of a hero, to whom we are attached. In the same instant we com|fort
ourselves, by reflecting, that it is nothing but a fiction: And it is precisely
that mixture of sentiments, which composes an agreeable sorrow, and tears that
delight us. But as that affliction, which is caused by exterior and sensible
objects, is stronger than the consolation which arises from an internal
reflection, they are the effects and symptoms of sorrow, that ought to
predominate in the composition."

{#8,pages=219} This solution seems just and convincing; but perhaps it wants
still some new addition, in order to make it answer fully the ph{ae}nomenon,
which we here examine. All the passions, excited by eloquence, are agreeable in
the highest degree, as well as those which are moved by painting and the
theatre. The epilogues of ^Cicero^ are, on this account chiefly, the delight of
every reader of taste; and it is difficult to read some of them without the
deepest sympathy and sorrow. His merit as an orator, no doubt, depends much on
his success in this particular. When he had raised tears in his judges and all
his audience, they were then the most highly delighted, and expressed the
greatest satisfaction with the pleader. The pathetic description of the
butchery, made by ^Verres^ of the ^Sicilian^ captains, is a masterpiece of this
kind: But I believe none will affirm, that the being present at a melancholy
scene of that nature would afford any entertainment. Neither is the sorrow here
softened by fiction: For the audience were convinced of the reality of every
circumstance. What is it then, which in this case raises a pleasure from the
bosom of uneasiness, so to speak; and a pleasure, which still retains all the
features and outward symptoms of distress and sorrow?

{#9,pages=219-20} I answer: This extraordinary effect proceeds from that very
eloquence, with which the melancholy scene is represented. The genius required
to paint objects in a lively manner, the art employed in collecting all the
pathetic circumstances, the judgment displayed in disposing them: the exercise,
I say, of these noble talents, together with the force of expression, and
|beauty of oratorial numbers, diffuse the highest satisfaction on the audience,
and excite the most delightful movements. By this means, the uneasiness of the
melancholy passions is not only overpowered and effaced by something stronger of
an opposite kind; but the whole impulse of those passions is converted into
pleasure, and swells the delight which the eloquence raises in us. The same
force of oratory, employed on an uninteresting subject, would not please half so
much, or rather would appear altogether ridiculous; and the mind, being left in
absolute calmness and indifference, would relish none of those beauties of
imagination or expression, which, if joined to passion, give it such exquisite
entertainment. The impulse or vehemence, arising from sorrow, compassion,
indignation, receives a new direction from the sentiments of beauty. The latter,
being the predominant emotion, seize the whole mind, and convert the former into
themselves, at least tincture them so strongly as totally to alter their nature.
And the soul, being, at the same time, rouzed by passion, and charmed by
eloquence, feels on the whole a strong movement, which is altogether delightful.

{#10,pages=220-1} The same principle takes place in tragedy; with this addition,
that tragedy is an imitation; and imitation is always of itself agreeable. This
circumstance serves still farther to smooth the motions of passion, and convert
the whole feeling into one uniform and strong enjoyment. Objects of the greatest
terror and distress please in painting, and please more than the most beautiful
objects, that appear calm and indifferent[n2]. The affection, rouzing the mind,
excites a large stock of spirit and vehemence; which is all transformed into
pleasure by the |force of the prevailing movement. It is thus the fiction of
tragedy softens the passion, by an infusion of a new feeling, not merely by
weakening or diminishing the sorrow. You may by degrees weaken a real sorrow,
till it totally disappears; yet in none of its gradations will it ever give
pleasure; except, perhaps, by accident, to a man sunk under lethargic indolence,
whom it rouzes from that languid state.

{#11,pages=221} To confirm this theory, it will be sufficient to produce other
instances, where the subordinate movement is converted into the predominant, and
gives force to it, though of a different, and even sometimes though of a
contrary nature.

{#12,pages=221} Novelty naturally rouzes the mind, and attracts our attention;
and the movements, which it causes, are always converted into any passion,
belonging to the object, and join their force to it. Whether an event excite joy
or sorrow, pride or shame, anger or good-will, it is sure to produce a stronger
affection, when new or unusual. And though novelty of itself be agreeable, it
fortifies the painful, as well as agreeable passions.

{#13,pages=221} Had you any intention to move a person extremely by the
narration of any event, the best method of encreasing its effect would be
artfully to delay informing him of it, and first to excite his curiosity and
impatience before you let him into the secret. This is the artifice practised by
^Iago^ in the famous scene of ^Shakespeare^; and every spectator is sensible,
that ^Othello^'s jealousy acquires additional force from his preceding
impatience, and that the subordinate passion is here readily transformed into
the predominant one.

{#14,pages=221} Difficulties encrease passions of every kind; and by rouzing our
attention, and exciting our active powers, they produce an emotion, which
nourishes the prevailing affection.

{#15,pages=221} Parents commonly love that child most, whose sickly infirm frame
of body has occasioned them the greatest pains, trouble, and anxiety in rearing
him. The agreeable sentiment of affection here acquires force from sentiments of
uneasiness.

{#16,pages=222} Nothing endears so much a friend as sorrow for his death. The
pleasure of his company has not so powerful an influence.

{#17,pages=222} Jealousy is a painful passion; yet without some share of it, the
agreeable affection of love has difficulty to subsist in its full force and
violence. Absence is also a great source of complaint among lovers, and gives
them the greatest uneasiness: Yet nothing is more favourable to their mutual
passion than short intervals of that kind. And if long intervals often prove
fatal, it is only because, through time, men are accustomed to them, and they
cease to give uneasiness. Jealousy and absence in love compose the _dolce
peccante_ of the ^Italians^, which they suppose so essential to all pleasure.

{#18,pages=222} There is a fine observation of the elder ^Pliny^, which
illustrates the principle here insisted on. _It is very remarkable_, says he,
_that the last works of celebrated artists, which they left imperfect, are
always the most prized, such as the ^Iris^ of ^Aristides^, the ^Tyndarides^ of
^Nicomachus^, the ^Medea^ of ^Timomachus^, and the ^Venus^ of ^Apelles^. These
are valued even above their finished productions: The broken lineaments of the
piece, and the half-formed idea of the painter are carefully studied; and our
very grief for that curious hand, which had been stopped by death, is an
additional encrease to our pleasure[n3]._

{#19,pages=222-3} These instances (and many more might be collected) are
sufficient to afford us some insight into the analogy of nature, and to show us,
that the pleasure, which poets, orators, and musicians give us, by exciting
grief, sorrow, indignation, compassion, is not so extraordinary or paradoxical,
as it may at first sight appear. The force of imagination, the energy of
expression, the power of numbers, the charms of imitation; all these are
naturally, of themselves, delightful to the mind: And when |the object presented
lays also hold of some affection, the pleasure still rises upon us, by the
conversion of this subordinate movement into that which is predominant. The
passion, though, perhaps, naturally, and when excited by the simple appearance
of a real object, it may be painful; yet is so smoothed, and softened, and
mollified, when raised by the finer arts, that it affords the highest
entertainment.

{#20,pages=223} To confirm this reasoning, we may observe, that if the movements
of the imagination be not predominant above those of the passion, a contrary
effect follows; and the former, being now subordinate, is converted into the
latter, and still farther encreases the pain and affliction of the sufferer.

{#21,pages=223} Who could ever think of it as a good expedient for comforting an
afflicted parent, to exaggerate, with all the force of elocution, the
irreparable loss, which he has met with by the death of a favourite child? The
more power of imagination and expression you here employ, the more you encrease
his despair and affliction.

{#22,pages=223} The shame, confusion, and terror of ^Verres^, no doubt, rose in
proportion to the noble eloquence and vehemence of ^Cicero^: So also did his
pain and uneasiness. These former passions were too strong for the pleasure
arising from the beauties of elocution; and operated, though from the same
principle, yet in a contrary manner, to the sympathy, compassion, and
indignation of the audience.

{#23,pages=223-4} Lord ^Clarendon^, when he approaches towards the catastrophe
of the royal party, supposes, that his narration must then become infinitely
disagreeable; and he hurries over the king's death, without giving us one
circumstance of it. He considers it as too horrid a scene to be contemplated
with any satisfaction, or even without the utmost pain and aversion. He himself,
as well as the readers of that age, were too deeply concerned in the events, and
felt a pain from subjects, which |an historian and a reader of another age would
regard as the most pathetic and most interesting, and, by consequence, the most
agreeable.

{#24,pages=224} An action, represented in tragedy, may be too bloody and
atrocious. It may excite such movements of horror as will not soften into
pleasure; and the greatest energy of expression, bestowed on descriptions of
that nature, serves only to augment our uneasiness. Such is that action
represented in the _Ambitious Stepmother_, where a venerable old man, raised to
the height of fury and despair, rushes against a pillar, and striking his head
upon it, besmears it all over with mingled brains and gore. The ^English^
theatre abounds too much with such shocking images.

{#25,pages=224} Even the common sentiments of compassion require to be softened
by some agreeable affection, in order to give a thorough satisfaction to the
audience. The mere suffering of plaintive virtue, under the triumphant tyranny
and oppression of vice, forms a disagreeable spectacle, and is carefully avoided
by all masters of the drama. In order to dismiss the audience with entire
satisfaction and contentment, the virtue must either convert itself into a noble
courageous despair, or the vice receive its proper punishment.

{#26,pages=224} Most painters appear in this light to have been very unhappy in
their subjects. As they wrought much for churches and convents, they have
chiefly represented such horrible subjects as crucifixions and martyrdoms, where
nothing appears but tortures, wounds, executions, and passive suffering, without
any action or affection. When they turned their pencil from this ghastly
mythology, they had commonly recourse to ^Ovid^, whose fictions, though
passionate and agreeable, are scarcely natural or probable enough for painting.

{#27,pages=224-5} The same inversion of that principle, which is here insisted
on, displays itself in common life, as in the effects of oratory and poetry.
Raise so the subordinate passion that it becomes |the predominant, it swallows
up that affection which it before nourished and encreased. Too much jealousy
extinguishes love: Too much difficulty renders us indifferent: Too much sickness
and infirmity disgusts a selfish and unkind parent.

{#28,pages=225} What so disagreeable as the dismal, gloomy, disastrous stories,
with which melancholy people entertain their companions? The uneasy passion
being there raised alone, unaccompanied with any spirit, genius, or eloquence,
conveys a pure uneasiness, and is attended with nothing that can soften it into
pleasure or satisfaction.

{#n2} See NOTE [N].

{#n2.1,pages=220} PAINTERS make no scruple of representing distress and sorrow
as well as any other passion: But they seem not to dwell so much on these
melancholy affections as the poets, who, though they copy every motion of the
human breast, yet pass quickly over the agreeable sentiments. A painter
represents only one instant; and if that be passionate enough, it is sure to
affect and delight the spectator: But nothing can furnish to the poet a variety
of scenes and incidents and sentiments, except distress, terror, or anxiety.
Compleat joy and satisfaction is attended with security, and leaves no farther
room for action.
