{#1,pages=169} DISPUTES with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles,
are, of all others, the most irksome; except, perhaps, those with persons,
entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but
engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or
from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind. The
same blind adherence to their own arguments is to be expected in both; the same
contempt of their antagonists; and the same passionate vehemence, in inforcing
sophistry and falsehood. And as reasoning is not the source, whence either
disputant derives his tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which
speaks not to the affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder
principles.

{#2,pages=169-70} Those who have denied the reality of moral distinctions, may
be ranked among the disingenuous disputants; nor is it conceivable, that any
human creature could ever seriously believe, that all characters and actions
were alike entitled to |the affection and regard of every one. The difference,
which nature has placed between one man and another, is so wide, and this
difference is still so much farther widened, by education, example, and habit,
that, where the opposite extremes come at once under our apprehension, there is
no scepticism so scrupulous, and scarce any assurance so determined, as
absolutely to deny all distinction between them. Let a man's insensibility be
ever so great, he must often be touched with the images of RIGHT and WRONG; and
let his prejudices be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that others are
susceptible of like impressions. The only way, therefore, of converting an
antagonist of this kind, is to leave him to himself. For, finding that no body
keeps up the controversy with him, it is probable he will, at last, of himself,
from mere weariness, come over to the side of common sense and reason.

{#3,pages=170} There has been a controversy started of late, much better worth
examination, concerning the general foundation of MORALS; whether they be
derived from REASON, or from SENTIMENT; whether we attain the knowledge of them
by a chain of argument and induction, or by an immediate feeling and finer
internal sense; whether, like all sound judgment of truth and falsehood, they
should be the same to every rational intelligent being; or whether, like the
perception of beauty and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular
fabric and constitution of the human species.

{#4,pages=170-1} The ancient philosophers, though they often affirm, that virtue
is nothing but conformity to reason, yet, in general, seem to consider morals as
deriving their existence from taste and sentiment. On the other hand, our modern
enquirers, though they also talk much of the beauty of virtue, and deformity of
vice, yet have commonly endeavoured to account for these distinctions by
metaphysical reasonings, and by deductions from the most abstract principles of
the understanding. Such confusion reigned in these subjects, |that an opposition
of the greatest consequence could prevail between one system and another, and
even in the parts of almost each individual system; and yet no body, till very
lately, was ever sensible of it. The elegant Lord ^Shaftesbury^, who first gave
occasion to remark this distinction, and who, in general, adhered to the
principles of the ancients, is not, himself, entirely free from the same
confusion.

{#5,pages=171} It must be acknowledged, that both sides of the question are
susceptible of specious arguments. Moral distinctions, it may be said, are
discernible by pure _reason:_ Else, whence the many disputes that reign in
common life, as well as in philosophy, with regard to this subject: The long
chain of proofs often produced on both sides; the examples cited, the
authorities appealed to, the analogies employed, the fallacies detected, the
inferences drawn, and the several conclusions adjusted to their proper
principles. Truth is disputable; not taste: What exists in the nature of things
is the standard of our judgment; what each man feels within himself is the
standard of sentiment. Propositions in geometry may be proved, systems in
physics may be controverted; but the harmony of verse, the tenderness of
passion, the brilliancy of wit, must give immediate pleasure. No man reasons
concerning another's beauty; but frequently concerning the justice or injustice
of his actions. In every criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to
disprove the facts alleged, and deny the actions imputed to him: The second to
prove, that, even if these actions were real, they might be justified, as
innocent and lawful. It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding, that
the first point is ascertained: How can we suppose that a different faculty of
the mind is employed in fixing the other?

{#6,pages=171-2} On the other hand, those who would resolve all moral
determinations into _sentiment_, may endeavour to show, that it is impossible
for reason ever to draw conclusions of this nature. To virtue, say they, it
belongs to be _amiable_, and |vice _odious_. This forms their very nature or
essence. But can reason or argumentation distribute these different epithets to
any subjects, and pronounce before-hand, that this must produce love, and that
hatred? Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections, but the
original fabric and formation of the human mind, which is naturally adapted to
receive them?

{#7,pages=172} The end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty; and,
by proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue, beget
correspondent habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and embrace the other. But
is this ever to be expected from inferences and conclusions of the
understanding, which of themselves have no hold of the affections, or set in
motion the active powers of men? They discover truths: But where the truths
which they discover are indifferent, and beget no desire or aversion, they can
have no influence on conduct and behaviour. What is honourable, what is fair,
what is becoming, what is noble, what is generous, takes possession of the
heart, and animates us to embrace and maintain it. What is intelligible, what is
evident, what is probable, what is true, procures only the cool assent of the
understanding; and gratifying a speculative curiosity, puts an end to our
researches.

{#8,pages=172} Extinguish all the warm feelings and prepossessions in favour of
virtue, and all disgust or aversion to vice: Render men totally indifferent
towards these distinctions; and morality is no longer a practical study, nor has
any tendency to regulate our lives and actions.

{#9,pages=172-3} These arguments on each side (and many more might be produced)
are so plausible, that I am apt to suspect, they may, the one as well as the
other, be solid and satisfactory, and that _reason_ and _sentiment_ concur in
almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence, it is
probable, which pronounces characters and actions amiable or odious,
praise-worthy or blameable; that which stamps |on them the mark of honour or
infamy, approbation or censure; that which renders morality an active principle,
and constitutes virtue our happiness, and vice our misery: It is probable, I
say, that this final sentence depends on some internal sense or feeling, which
nature has made universal in the whole species. For what else can have an
influence of this nature? But in order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and
give a proper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that
much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just conclusions
drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and general
facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of beauty, especially the natural
kinds, on their first appearance, command our affection and approbation; and
where they fail of this effect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress
their influence, or adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many
orders of beauty, particularly those of the finer arts, it is requisite to
employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment; and a false relish
may frequently be corrected by argument and reflection. There are just grounds
to conclude, that moral beauty partakes much of this latter species, and demands
the assistance of our intellectual faculties, in order to give it a suitable
influence on the human mind.

{#10,pages=173-5} But though this question, concerning the general principles of
morals, be curious and important, it is needless for us, at present, to employ
farther care in our researches concerning it. For if we can be so happy, in the
course of this enquiry, as to discover the true origin of morals, it will then
easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters into all determinations
of this nature[n1]. In order to attain this purpose, we shall endeavour to
follow a very simple method: We shall analyze that complication of mental
qualities, which form what, in common life, we call ^Personal Merit^: We shall
|consider every attribute of the mind, which renders a man an object either of
esteem and affection, or of hatred and contempt; every habit or sentiment or
faculty, which, if ascribed to any person, implies either praise or blame, and
may enter into any panegyric or satire of his character and manners. The quick
sensibility, which, on this head, is so universal among mankind, gives a
philosopher sufficient assurance, that he can never be considerably mistaken in
framing the catalogue, or incur any danger of misplacing the objects of his
contemplation: He needs only enter into his own breast for a moment, and
consider whether or not he should desire to have this or that quality ascribed
to him, and whether such or such an imputation would proceed from a friend or an
enemy. The very nature of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a
judgment of this nature; and as every tongue possesses one set of words which
are taken in a good sense, and another in the opposite, the least acquaintance
with the idiom suffices, without any reasoning, to direct us in collecting and
arranging the estimable or blameable qualities of men. The only object of
reasoning is to discover the circumstances on both sides, which are common to
these qualities; to observe that particular in which the estimable qualities
agree on the one hand, and the blameable on the other; and thence to reach the
foundation of ethics, and find those universal principles, from which all
censure or approbation is ultimately derived. As this is a question of fact, not
of abstract science, we can only expect success, by following the experimental
method, and deducing general maxims from a comparison of particular instances.
The other scientifical method, where a general abstract principle is first
established, and is afterwards branched out into a variety of inferences and
conclusions, may be more perfect in itself, but suits less the imperfection of
human nature, and is a common source of illusion and mistake in this as well as
in other subjects. Men are now cured of |their passion for hypotheses and
systems in natural philosophy, and will hearken to no arguments but those which
are derived from experience. It is full time they should attempt a like
reformation in all moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics,
however subtile or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation.

{#11,pages=175} We shall begin our enquiry on this head by the consideration of
the social virtues, benevolence and justice. The explication of them will
probably give us an opening by which the others may be accounted for.
