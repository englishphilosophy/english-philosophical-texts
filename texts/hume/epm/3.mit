£2 Of ^Justice^. £2

{#1,pages=183} THAT ^Justice^ is useful to society, and consequently that _part_
of its merit, at least, must arise from that consideration, it would be a
superfluous undertaking to prove. That public utility is the _sole_ origin of
justice, and that reflections on the beneficial consequences of this virtue are
the _sole_ foundation of its merit; this proposition, being more curious and
important, will better deserve our examination and enquiry.

{#2,pages=183} Let us suppose, that nature has bestowed on the human race such
profuse _abundance_ of all _external_ conveniencies, that, without any
uncertainty in the event, without any care or industry on our part, every
individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious
appetites can want, or luxurious imagination wish or desire. His natural beauty,
we shall suppose, surpasses all acquired ornaments: The perpetual clemency of
the seasons renders useless all cloaths or covering: The raw herbage affords him
the most delicious fare; the clear fountain, the richest beverage. No laborious
occupation required: No tillage: No navigation. Music, poetry, and contemplation
form his sole business: Conversation, mirth, and friendship his sole amusement.

{#3,pages=183-4} It seems evident, that, in such a happy state, every other
social virtue would flourish, and receive tenfold encrease; |but the cautious,
jealous virtue of justice would never once have been dreamed of. For what
purpose make a partition of goods, where every one has already more than enough?
Why give rise to property, where there cannot possibly be any injury? Why call
this object _mine_, when, upon the seizing of it by another, I need but stretch
out my hand to possess myself of what is equally valuable? Justice, in that
case, being totally USELESS, would be an idle ceremonial, and could never
possibly have place in the catalogue of virtues.

{#4,pages=184} We see, even in the present necessitous condition of mankind,
that, wherever any benefit is bestowed by nature in an unlimited abundance, we
leave it always in common among the whole human race, and make no subdivisions
of right and property. Water and air, though the most necessary of all objects,
are not challenged as the property of individuals; nor can any man commit
injustice by the most lavish use and enjoyment of these blessings. In fertile
extensive countries, with few inhabitants, land is regarded on the same footing.
And no topic is so much insisted on by those, who defend the liberty of the
seas, as the unexhausted use of them in navigation. Were the advantages,
procured by navigation, as inexhaustible, these reasoners had never had any
adversaries to refute; nor had any claims ever been advanced of a separate,
exclusive dominion over the ocean.

{#5,pages=184} It may happen, in some countries, at some periods, that there be
established a property in water, none in land[n10]; if the latter be in greater
abundance than can be used by the inhabitants, and the former be found, with
difficulty, and in very small quantities.

{#6,pages=184-5} Again; suppose, that, though the necessities of human race
continue the same as at present, yet the mind is so enlarged, and so replete
with friendship and generosity, |that every man has the utmost tenderness for
every man, and feels no more concern for his own interest than for that of his
fellows: It seems evident, that the USE of justice would, in this case, be
suspended by such an extensive benevolence, nor would the divisions and barriers
of property and obligation have ever been thought of. Why should I bind another,
by a deed or promise, to do me any good office, when I know that he is already
prompted, by the strongest inclination, to seek my happiness, and would, of
himself, perform the desired service; except the hurt, he thereby receives, be
greater than the benefit accruing to me? in which case, he knows, that, from my
innate humanity and friendship, I should be the first to oppose myself to his
imprudent generosity. Why raise land-marks between my neighbour's field and
mine, when my heart has made no division between our interests; but shares all
his joys and sorrows with the same force and vivacity as if originally my own?
Every man, upon this supposition, being a second self to another, would trust
all his interests to the discretion of every man; without jealousy, without
partition, without distinction. And the whole human race would form only one
family; where all would lie in common, and be used freely, without regard to
property; but cautiously too, with as entire regard to the necessities of each
individual, as if our own interests were most intimately concerned.

{#7,pages=185-6} In the present disposition of the human heart, it would,
perhaps, be difficult to find compleat instances of such enlarged affections;
but still we may observe, that the case of families approaches towards it; and
the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the individuals, the nearer it
approaches; till all distinction of property be, in a great measure, lost and
confounded among them. Between married persons, the cement of friendship is by
the laws supposed so strong as to abolish all division of possessions; and has
often, in reality, the force ascribed to it. And it is |observable, that, during
the ardour of new enthusiasms, when every principle is inflamed into
extravagance, the community of goods has frequently been attempted; and nothing
but experience of its inconveniencies, from the returning or disguised
selfishness of men, could make the imprudent fanatics adopt anew the ideas of
justice and of separate property. So true is it, that this virtue derives its
existence entirely from its necessary _use_ to the intercourse and social state
of mankind.

{#8,pages=186-7} To make this truth more evident, let us reverse the foregoing
suppositions; and carrying every thing to the opposite extreme, consider what
would be the effect of these new situations. Suppose a society to fall into such
want of all common necessaries, that the utmost frugality and industry cannot
preserve the greater number from perishing, and the whole from extreme misery:
It will readily, I believe, be admitted, that the strict laws of justice are
suspended, in such a pressing emergence, and give place to the stronger motives
of necessity and self-preservation. Is it any crime, after a shipwreck, to seize
whatever means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of, without regard to
former limitations of property? Or if a city besieged were perishing with
hunger; can we imagine, that men will see any means of preservation before them,
and lose their lives, from a scrupulous regard to what, in other situations,
would be the rules of equity and justice? The USE and TENDENCY of that virtue is
to procure happiness and security, by preserving order in society: But where the
society is ready to perish from extreme necessity, no greater evil can be
dreaded from violence and injustice; and every man may now provide for himself
by all the means, which prudence can dictate, or humanity permit. The public,
even in less urgent necessities, opens granaries, without the consent of
proprietors; as justly supposing, that the authority of magistracy may,
consistent with equity, extend so far: But were any |number of men to assemble,
without the tye of laws or civil jurisdiction; would an equal partition of bread
in a famine, though effected by power and even violence, be regarded as criminal
or injurious?

{#9,pages=187} Suppose likewise, that it should be a virtuous man's fate to fall
into the society of ruffians, remote from the protection of laws and government;
what conduct must he embrace in that melancholy situation? He sees such a
desperate rapaciousness prevail; such a disregard to equity, such contempt of
order, such stupid blindness to future consequences, as must immediately have
the most tragical conclusion, and must terminate in destruction to the greater
number, and in a total dissolution of society to the rest. He, mean while, can
have no other expedient than to arm himself, to whomever the sword he seizes, or
the buckler, may belong: To make provision of all means of defence and security:
And his particular regard to justice being no longer of USE to his own safety or
that of others, he must consult the dictates of self-preservation alone, without
concern for those who no longer merit his care and attention.

{#10,pages=187} When any man, even in political society, renders himself, by his
crimes, obnoxious to the public, he is punished by the laws in his goods and
person; that is, the ordinary rules of justice are, with regard to him,
suspended for a moment, and it becomes equitable to inflict on him, for the
_benefit_ of society, what, otherwise, he could not suffer without wrong or
injury.

{#11,pages=187-8} The rage and violence of public war; what is it but a
suspension of justice among the warring parties, who perceive, that this virtue
is now no longer of any _use_ or advantage to them? The laws of war, which then
succeed to those of equity and justice, are rules calculated for the _advantage_
and _utility_ of that particular state, in which men are now placed. And were a
civilized nation engaged with barbarians, who observed no rules even of war; the
former |must also suspend their observance of them, where they no longer serve
to any purpose; and must render every action or rencounter as bloody and
pernicious as possible to the first aggressors.

{#12,pages=188} Thus, the rules of equity or justice depend entirely on the
particular state and condition, in which men are placed, and owe their origin
and existence to that UTILITY, which results to the public from their strict and
regular observance. Reverse, in any considerable circumstance, the condition of
men: Produce extreme abundance or extreme necessity: Implant in the human breast
perfect moderation and humanity, or perfect rapaciousness and malice: By
rendering justice totally _useless_, you thereby totally destroy its essence,
and suspend its obligation upon mankind.

{#13,pages=188} The common situation of society is a medium amidst all these
extremes. We are naturally partial to ourselves, and to our friends; but are
capable of learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable conduct. Few
enjoyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of nature; but by art,
labour, and industry, we can extract them in great abundance. Hence the ideas of
property become necessary in all civil society: Hence justice derives its
usefulness to the public: And hence alone arises its merit and moral obligation.

{#14,pages=188-9} These conclusions are so natural and obvious, that they have
not escaped even the poets, in their descriptions of the felicity, attending the
golden age or the reign of ^Saturn^. The seasons, in that first period of
nature, were so temperate, if we credit these agreeable fictions, that there was
no necessity for men to provide themselves with cloaths and houses, as a
security against the violence of heat and cold: The rivers flowed with wine and
milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature spontaneously produced her greatest
delicacies. Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age. Tempests were
not alone removed from nature; but |those more furious tempests were unknown to
human breasts, which now cause such uproar, and engender such confusion.
Avarice, ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cordial affection,
compassion, sympathy, were the only movements with which the mind was yet
acquainted. Even the punctilious distinction of _mine_ and _thine_ was banished
from among that happy race of mortals, and carried with it the very notion of
property and obligation, justice and injustice.

{#15,pages=189} This _poetical_ fiction of the _golden age_ is, in some
respects, of a piece with the _philosophical_ fiction of the _state of nature_;
only that the former is represented as the most charming and most peaceable
condition, which can possibly be imagined; whereas the latter is painted out as
a state of mutual war and violence, attended with the most extreme necessity. On
the first origin of mankind, we are told, their ignorance and savage nature were
so prevalent, that they could give no mutual trust, but must each depend upon
himself, and his own force or cunning for protection and security. No law was
heard of: No rule of justice known: No distinction of property regarded: Power
was the only measure of right; and a perpetual war of all against all was the
result of men's untamed selfishness and barbarity[n11].

{#16,pages=190} Whether such a condition of human nature could ever exist, or if
it did, could continue so long as to merit the appellation of a _state_, may
justly be doubted. Men are necessarily born in a family-society, at least; and
are trained up by their parents to some rule of conduct and behaviour. But this
must be admitted, that, if such a state of mutual war and violence was ever
real, the suspension of all laws of justice, from their absolute inutility, is a
necessary and infallible consequence.

{#17,pages=190} The more we vary our views of human life, and the newer and more
unusual the lights are, in which we survey it, the more shall we be convinced,
that the origin here assigned for the virtue of justice is real and
satisfactory.

{#18,pages=190-1} Were there a species of creatures, intermingled with men,
which, though rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body
and mind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon the
highest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment; the necessary
consequence, I think, is, that we should be bound, by the laws of humanity, to
give gentle usage to these creatures, but should not, properly speaking, lie
under any restraint of justice with regard to them, nor could they possess any
right or property, exclusive of such arbitrary lords. Our intercourse with them
could not be called society, which supposes a degree of equality; but absolute
command on the one side, and servile obedience on the other. Whatever we covet,
they must instantly resign: Our permission is the only tenure, by which they
hold their possessions: Our compassion and kindness the only check, |by which
they curb our lawless will: And as no inconvenience ever results from the
exercise of a power, so firmly established in nature, the restraints of justice
and property, being totally _useless_, would never have place in so unequal a
confederacy.

{#19,pages=191} This is plainly the situation of men, with regard to animals;
and how far these may be said to possess reason, I leave it to others to
determine. The great superiority of civilized ^Europeans^ above barbarous
^Indians^, tempted us to imagine ourselves on the same footing with regard to
them, and made us throw off all restraints of justice, and even of humanity, in
our treatment of them. In many nations, the female sex are reduced to like
slavery, and are rendered incapable of all property, in opposition to their
lordly masters. But though the males, when united, have, in all countries,
bodily force sufficient to maintain this severe tyranny; yet such are the
insinuation, address, and charms of their fair companions, that women are
commonly able to break the confederacy, and share with the other sex in all the
rights and privileges of society.

{#20,pages=191-2} Were the human species so framed by nature as that each
individual possessed within himself every faculty, requisite both for his own
preservation and for the propagation of his kind: Were all society and
intercourse cut off between man and man, by the primary intention of the supreme
Creator: It seems evident, that so solitary a being would be as much incapable
of justice, as of social discourse and conversation. Where mutual regards and
forbearance serve to no manner of purpose, they would never direct the conduct
of any reasonable man. The headlong course of the passions would be checked by
no reflection on future consequences. And as each man is here supposed to love
himself alone, and to depend only on himself and his own activity for safety and
happiness, he would, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power, challenge
the preference above |every other being, to none of which he is bound by any
ties, either of nature or of interest.

{#21,pages=192} But suppose the conjunction of the sexes to be established in
nature, a family immediately arises; and particular rules being found requisite
for its subsistence, these are immediately embraced; though without
comprehending the rest of mankind within their prescriptions. Suppose, that
several families unite together into one society, which is totally disjoined
from all others, the rules, which preserve peace and order, enlarge themselves
to the utmost extent of that society; but becoming then entirely useless, lose
their force when carried one step farther. But again suppose, that several
distinct societies maintain a kind of intercourse for mutual convenience and
advantage, the boundaries of justice still grow larger, in proportion to the
largeness of men's views, and the force of their mutual connexions. History,
experience, reason sufficiently instruct us in this natural progress of human
sentiments, and in the gradual enlargement of our regards to justice, in
proportion as we become acquainted with the extensive utility of that virtue.

{#22,pages=192} If we examine the _particular_ laws, by which justice is
directed, and property determined; we shall still be presented with the same
conclusion. The good of mankind is the only object of all these laws and
regulations. Not only it is requisite, for the peace and interest of society,
that men's possessions should be separated; but the rules, which we follow, in
making the separation, are such as can best be contrived to serve farther the
interests of society.

{#23,pages=192-3} We shall suppose, that a creature, possessed of reason, but
unacquainted with human nature, deliberates with himself what RULES of justice
or property would best promote |public interest, and establish peace and
security among mankind: His most obvious thought would be, to assign the largest
possessions to the most extensive virtue, and give every one the power of doing
good, proportioned to his inclination. In a perfect theocracy, where a being,
infinitely intelligent, governs by particular volitions, this rule would
certainly have place, and might serve to the wisest purposes: But were mankind
to execute such a law; so great is the uncertainty of merit, both from its
natural obscurity, and from the self-conceit of each individual, that no
determinate rule of conduct would ever result from it; and the total dissolution
of society must be the immediate consequence. Fanatics may suppose, _that
dominion is founded on grace_, and _that saints alone inherit the earth_; but
the civil magistrate very justly puts these sublime theorists on the same
footing with common robbers, and teaches them by the severest discipline, that a
rule, which, in speculation, may seem the most advantageous to society, may yet
be found, in practice, totally pernicious and destructive.

{#24,pages=193} That there were _religious_ fanatics of this kind in ^England^,
during the civil wars, we learn from history; though it is probable, that the
obvious _tendency_ of these principles excited such horror in mankind, as soon
obliged the dangerous enthusiasts to renounce, or at least conceal their tenets.
Perhaps, the _levellers_, who claimed an equal distribution of property, were a
kind of _political_ fanatics, which arose from the religious species, and more
openly avowed their pretensions; as carrying a more plausible appearance, of
being practicable in themselves, as well as useful to human society.

{#25,pages=193-4} It must, indeed, be confessed, that nature is so liberal to
mankind, that, were all her presents equally divided among the species, and
improved by art and industry, every individual would enjoy all the necessaries,
and even most of the comforts of life; nor would ever be liable to any ills, but
such as might accidentally arise from the sickly frame and |constitution of his
body. It must also be confessed, that, wherever we depart from this equality, we
rob the poor of more satisfaction than we add to the rich, and that the slight
gratification of a frivolous vanity, in one individual, frequently costs more
than bread to many families, and even provinces. It may appear withal, that the
rule of equality, as it would be highly _useful_, is not altogether
_impracticable_; but has taken place, at least in an imperfect degree, in some
republics; particularly that of ^Sparta^; where it was attended, it is said,
with the most beneficial consequences. Not to mention, that the ^Agrarian^ laws,
so frequently claimed in ^Rome^, and carried into execution in many ^Greek^
cities, proceeded, all of them, from a general idea of the utility of this
principle.

{#26,pages=194} But historians, and even common sense, may inform us, that,
however specious these ideas of _perfect_ equality may seem, they are really, at
bottom, _impracticable_; and were they not so, would be extremely _pernicious_
to human society. Render possessions ever so equal, men's different degrees of
art, care, and industry will immediately break that equality. Or if you check
these virtues, you reduce society to the most extreme indigence; and instead of
preventing want and beggary in a few, render it unavoidable to the whole
community. The most rigorous inquisition too is requisite to watch every
inequality on its first appearance; and the most severe jurisdiction, to punish
and redress it. But besides, that so much authority must soon degenerate into
tyranny, and be exerted with great partialities; who can possibly be possessed
of it, in such a situation as is here supposed? Perfect equality of possessions,
destroying all subordination, weakens extremely the authority of magistracy, and
must reduce all power nearly to a level, as well as property.

{#27,pages=194-5} We may conclude, therefore, that, in order to establish laws
for the regulation of property, we must be acquainted with the nature and
situation of man; must reject |appearances, which may be false, though specious;
and must search for those rules, which are, on the whole, most _useful_ and
_beneficial_. Vulgar sense and slight experience are sufficient for this
purpose; where men give not way to too selfish avidity, or too extensive
enthusiasm.

{#28,pages=195} Who sees not, for instance, that whatever is produced or
improved by a man's art or industry ought, for ever, to be secured to him, in
order to give encouragement to such _useful_ habits and accomplishments? That
the property ought also to descend to children and relations, for the same
_useful_ purpose? That it may be alienated by consent, in order to beget that
commerce and intercourse, which is so _beneficial_ to human society? And that
all contracts and promises ought carefully to be fulfilled, in order to secure
mutual trust and confidence, by which the general _interest_ of mankind is so
much promoted?

{#29,pages=195} Examine the writers on the laws of nature; and you will always
find, that, whatever principles they set out with, they are sure to terminate
here at last, and to assign, as the ultimate reason for every rule which they
establish, the convenience and necessities of mankind. A concession thus
extorted, in opposition to systems, has more authority, than if it had been made
in prosecution of them.

{#30,pages=195} What other reason, indeed, could writers ever give, why this
must be _mine_ and that _yours_; since uninstructed nature, surely, never made
any such distinction? The objects, which receive those appellations, are, of
themselves, foreign to us; they are totally disjoined and separated from us; and
nothing but the general interests of society can form the connexion.

{#31,pages=195-6} Sometimes, the interests of society may require a rule of
justice in a particular case; but may not determine any particular rule, among
several, which are all equally beneficial. In that case, the slightest
_analogies_ are laid hold of, in order to prevent that indifference and
ambiguity, which would be |the source of perpetual dissention. Thus possession
alone, and first possession, is supposed to convey property, where no body else
has any preceding claim and pretension. Many of the reasonings of lawyers are of
this analogical nature, and depend on very slight connexions of the imagination.

{#32,pages=196} Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all
regard to the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest
a distinction, which had been established for the sake of that interest? The
safety of the people is the supreme law: All other particular laws are
subordinate to it, and dependant on it: And if, in the _common_ course of
things, they be followed and regarded; it is only because the public safety and
interest _commonly_ demand so equal and impartial an administration.

{#33,pages=196} Sometimes both _utility_ and _analogy_ fail, and leave the laws
of justice in total uncertainty. Thus, it is highly requisite, that prescription
or long possession should convey property; but what number of days or months or
years should be sufficient for that purpose, it is impossible for reason alone
to determine. _Civil laws_ here supply the place of the natural _code_, and
assign different terms for prescription, according to the different _utilities_,
proposed by the legislator. Bills of exchange and promissory notes, by the laws
of most countries, prescribe sooner than bonds, and mortgages, and contracts of
a more formal nature.

{#34,pages=196-7} In general, we may observe, that all questions of property are
subordinate to the authority of civil laws, which extend, restrain, modify, and
alter the rules of natural justice, according to the particular _convenience_ of
each community. The laws have, or ought to have, a constant reference to the
constitution of government, the manners, the climate, the religion, the
commerce, the situation of each society. A late author of genius, as well as
learning, has prosecuted this subject at large, and has established, from these
prin|ciples, a system of political knowledge, which abounds in ingenious and
brilliant thoughts, and is not wanting in solidity[n12].

{#35,pages=197-8} _What is a man's property?_ Any thing, which it is lawful for
him, and for him alone, to use. _But what rule have we, by which we can
distinguish these objects?_ Here we must have recourse to statutes, customs,
precedents, analogies, and a hundred other circumstances; some of which are
constant and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary. But |the ultimate point,
in which they all professedly terminate, is, the interest and happiness of human
society. Where this enters not into consideration, nothing can appear more
whimsical, unnatural, and even superstitious, than all or most of the laws of
justice and of property.

{#36,pages=198} Those, who ridicule vulgar superstitions, and expose the folly
of particular regards to meats, days, places, postures, apparel, have an easy
task; while they consider all the qualities and relations of the objects, and
discover no adequate cause for that affection or antipathy, veneration or
horror, which have so mighty an influence over a considerable part of mankind. A
^Syrian^ would have starved rather than taste pigeon; an ^Egyptian^ would not
have approached bacon: But if these species of food be examined by the senses of
sight, smell, or taste, or scrutinized by the sciences of chymistry, medicine,
or physics; no difference is ever found between them and any other species, nor
can that precise circumstance be pitched on, which may afford a just foundation
for the religious passion. A fowl on Thursday is lawful food; on Friday
abominable: Eggs, in this house, and in this diocese, are permitted during Lent;
a hundred paces farther, to eat them is a damnable sin. This earth or building,
yesterday was profane; to-day, by the muttering of certain words, it has become
holy and sacred. Such reflections as these, in the mouth of a philosopher, one
may safely say, are too obvious to have any influence; because they must always,
to every man, occur at first sight; and where they prevail not, of themselves,
they are surely obstructed by education, prejudice, and passion, not by
ignorance or mistake.

{#37,pages=198-9} It may appear to a careless view, or rather a too abstracted
reflection, that there enters a like superstition into all the sentiments of
justice; and that, if a man expose its object, or what we call property, to the
same scrutiny of sense and science, he will not, by the most accurate enquiry,
find |any foundation for the difference made by moral sentiment. I may lawfully
nourish myself from this tree; but the fruit of another of the same species, ten
paces off, it is criminal for me to touch. Had I worne this apparel an hour ago,
I had merited the severest punishment; but a man, by pronouncing a few magical
syllables, has now rendered it fit for my use and service. Were this house
placed in the neighbouring territory, it had been immoral for me to dwell in it;
but being built on this side the river, it is subject to a different municipal
law, and, by its becoming mine, I incur no blame or censure. The same species of
reasoning, it may be thought, which so successfully exposes superstition, is
also applicable to justice; nor is it possible, in the one case more than in the
other, to point out, in the object, that precise quality or circumstance, which
is the foundation of the sentiment.

{#38,pages=199} But there is this material difference between _superstition_ and
_justice_, that the former is frivolous, useless, and burdensome; the latter is
absolutely requisite to the well-being of mankind and existence of society. When
we abstract from this circumstance (for it is too apparent ever to be
overlooked) it must be confessed, that all regards to right and property, seem
entirely without foundation, as much as the grossest and most vulgar
superstition. Were the interests of society nowise concerned, it is as
unintelligible, why another's articulating certain sounds implying consent,
should change the nature of my actions with regard to a particular object, as
why the reciting of a liturgy by a priest, in a certain habit and posture,
should dedicate a heap of brick and timber, and render it, thenceforth and for
ever, sacred[n13].

{#39,pages=200-1} These reflections are far from weakening the obligations of
justice, or diminishing any thing from the most sacred |attention to property.
On the contrary, such sentiments must acquire new force from the present
reasoning. For what stronger foundation can be desired or conceived for any
duty, than to observe, that human society, or even human nature could not
subsist, without the establishment of it; and will still arrive at greater
degrees of happiness and perfection, the more inviolable the regard is, which is
paid to that duty?

{#40,pages=201} The dilemma seems obvious: As justice evidently tends to promote
public utility and to support civil society, the sentiment of justice is either
derived from our reflecting on that tendency, or like hunger, thirst, and other
appetites, resentment, love of life, attachment to offspring, and other
passions, arises from a simple original instinct in the human breast, which
nature has implanted for like salutary purposes. If the latter be the case, it
follows, that property, which is the object of justice, is also distinguished by
a simple, original instinct, and is not ascertained by any argument or
reflection. But who is there that ever heard of such an instinct? Or is this a
subject, in which new discoveries can be made? We may as well expect to
discover, in the body, new senses, which had before escaped the observation of
all mankind.

{#41,pages=201-2} But farther, though it seems a very simple proposition to say,
that nature, by an instinctive sentiment, distinguishes property, yet in reality
we shall find, that there are required for that purpose ten thousand different
instincts, and these employed about objects of the greatest intricacy and nicest
discernment. For when a definition of _property_ is required, |that relation is
found to resolve itself into any possession acquired by occupation, by industry,
by prescription, by inheritance, by contract, _&c._ Can we think, that nature,
by an original instinct, instructs us in all these methods of acquisition?

{#42,pages=202} These words too, inheritance and contract, stand for ideas
infinitely complicated; and to define them exactly, a hundred volumes of laws,
and a thousand volumes of commentators, have not been found sufficient. Does
nature, whose instincts in men are all simple, embrace such complicated and
artificial objects, and create a rational creature, without trusting any thing
to the operation of his reason?

{#43,pages=202} But even though all this were admitted, it would not be
satisfactory. Positive laws can certainly transfer property. Is it by another
original instinct, that we recognize the authority of kings and senates, and
mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction? Judges too, even though their
sentence be erroneous and illegal, must be allowed, for the sake of peace and
order, to have decisive authority, and ultimately to determine property. Have we
original, innate ideas of pr{ae}tors and chancellors and juries? Who sees not,
that all these institutions arise merely from the necessities of human society?

{#44,pages=202} All birds of the same species in every age and country, build
their nests alike: In this we see the force of instinct. Men, in different times
and places, frame their houses differently: Here we perceive the influence of
reason and custom. A like inference may be drawn from comparing the instinct of
generation and the institution of property.

{#45,pages=202-3} How great soever the variety of municipal laws, it must be
confessed, that their chief out-lines pretty regularly concur; because the
purposes, to which they tend, are every where exactly similar. In like manner,
all houses have a roof and walls, windows and chimneys; though diversified in
their shape, figure, and materials. The purposes of the latter, |directed to the
conveniencies of human life, discover not more plainly their origin from reason
and reflection, than do those of the former, which point all to a like end.

{#46,pages=203} I need not mention the variations, which all the rules of
property receive from the finer turns and connexions of the imagination, and
from the subtilties and abstractions of law-topics and reasonings. There is no
possibility of reconciling this observation to the notion of original instincts.

{#47,pages=203} What alone will beget a doubt concerning the theory, on which I
insist, is the influence of education and acquired habits, by which we are so
accustomed to blame injustice, that we are not, in every instance, conscious of
any immediate reflection on the pernicious consequences of it. The views the
most familiar to us are apt, for that very reason, to escape us; and what we
have very frequently performed from certain motives, we are apt likewise to
continue mechanically, without recalling, on every occasion, the reflections,
which first determined us. The convenience, or rather necessity, which leads to
justice, is so universal, and every where points so much to the same rules, that
the habit takes place in all societies; and it is not without some scrutiny,
that we are able to ascertain its true origin. The matter, however, is not so
obscure, but that, even in common life, we have, every moment, recourse to the
principle of public utility, and ask, _What must become of the world, if such
practices prevail? How could society subsist under such disorders?_ Were the
distinction or separation of possessions entirely useless, can any one conceive,
that it ever should have obtained in society?

{#48,pages=203-4} Thus we seem, upon the whole, to have attained a knowledge of
the force of that principle here insisted on, and can determine what degree of
esteem or moral approbation may result from reflections on public interest and
utility. The necessity of justice to the support of society is the SOLE
foundation of that virtue; and since no moral excellence is |more highly
esteemed, we may conclude, that this circumstance of usefulness has, in general,
the strongest energy, and most entire command over our sentiments. It must,
therefore, be the source of a considerable part of the merit ascribed to
humanity, benevolence, friendship, public spirit, and other social virtues of
that stamp; as it is the SOLE source of the moral approbation paid to fidelity,
justice, veracity, integrity, and those other estimable and useful qualities and
principles. It is entirely agreeable to the rules of philosophy, and even of
common reason; where any principle has been found to have a great force and
energy in one instance, to ascribe to it a like energy in all similar instances.
This indeed is ^Newton^'s chief rule of philosophizing[n14].

{#n11.1,pages=189-90} THIS fiction of a state of nature, as a state of war, was
not first started by Mr. ^Hobbes^, as is commonly imagined. ^Plato^ endeavours
to refute an hypothesis very like it in the 2d, 3d, and 4th books de republica.
^Cicero^, on the contrary, supposes it certain and universally acknowledged in
the following passage. "Quis enim vestrûm, judices, ignorat, ita naturam rerum
tulisse, ut quodam tempore homines, nondum neque naturali, neque civili jure
descripto, fusi per agros, ac dispersi vagarentur tantumque haberent quantum
manu ac viribus, per c{ae}dem ac vulnera, aut eripere, aut retinere potuissent?
Qui igitur primi virtute & consilio pr{ae}stanti extiterunt, ii perspecto genere
human{ae} docilitatis atque ingenii, dissipatos unum in locum congregarunt,
eosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam ac mansuetudinem transduxerunt. Tum res ad
communem utilitatem, quas publicas appellamus, tum conventicula hominum, qu{ae}
postea civitates nominat{ae} sunt, tum domicilia conjuncta, quas urbes dicamus,
invento & divino & humano |jure, m{oe}nibus sepserunt. Atque inter hanc vitam,
perpolitam humanitate, & illam immanem, nihil tam interest quam JUS atque VIS.
Horum utro uti nolimus, altero est utendum. Vim volumus extingui? Jus valeat
necesse est, idi est, judicia, quibus omne jus continetur. Judicia displicent,
ant nulla, sunt? Vis dominetur necesse est? H{ae}c vident omnes." _Pro Sext_. l.

{#n12.1,pages=197} THE author of _L'Esprit des Loix_. This illustrious writer,
however, sets out with a different theory, and supposes all right to be founded
on certain _rapports_ or relations; which is a system, that, in my opinion,
never will be reconciled with true philosophy. Father ^Malebranche^, as far as I
can learn, was the first that started this abstract theory of morals, which was
afterwards adopted by ^Cudworth^, ^Clarke^, and others; and as it excludes all
sentiment, and pretends to found every thing on reason, it has not wanted
followers in this philosophic age. See Section I. Appendix I. With regard to
justice, the virtue here treated of, the inference against this theory seems
short and conclusive. Property is allowed to be dependent on civil laws; civil
laws are allowed to have no other object, but the interest of society: This
therefore must be allowed to be the sole foundation of property and justice. Not
to mention, that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate and his laws is
founded on nothing but the interests of society.

{#n12.2,pages=197} If the ideas of justice, sometimes, do not follow the
dispositions of civil law; we shall find, that these cases, instead of
objections, are confirmations of the theory delivered above. Where a civil law
is so perverse as to cross all the interests of society, it loses all its
authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural justice, which are conformable
to those interests. Sometimes also civil laws, for useful purposes, require a
ceremony or form to any deed; and where that is wanting, their decrees run
contrary to the usual tenour of justice; but one who takes advantage of such
chicanes, is not commonly regarded as an honest man. Thus, the interests of
society require, that contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material
article either of natural or civil justice: But the omission of a trifling
circumstance will often, by law, invalidate a contract, _in foro humano_, but
not _in foro conscienti{ae}_, as divines express themselves. In these cases, the
magistrate is supposed only to withdraw his power of enforcing the right, not to
have altered the right. Where his intention extends to the right, and is
conformable to the interests of society; it never fails to alter the right; a
clear proof of the origin of justice and of property, as assigned above.

{#n13} See NOTE [U].

{#n13.1,pages=199-200} IT is evident, that the will or consent alone never
transfers property, nor causes the obligation of a promise (for the same
reasoning extends to both) but the will must be expressed by words or signs, in
order to impose a tye upon any man. The expression being once brought in as
subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor
will a man be less bound by his word, though he secretly |give a different
direction to his intention, and with-hold the assent of his mind. But though the
expression makes, on most occasions, the whole of the promise, yet it does not
always so; and one who should make use of any expression, of which he knows not
the meaning, and which he uses without any sense of the consequences, would not
certainly be bound by it. Nay, though he know its meaning, yet if he use it in
jest only, and with such signs as evidently show, that he has no serious
intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any obligation of
performance; but it is necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the
will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to
imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from
certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his
expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion
to those cases where the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit.
All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if justice arise entirely
from its usefulness to society; but will never be explained on any other
hypothesis.

{#n13.2,pages=200} It is remarkable that the moral decisions of the _Jesuits_
and other relaxed casuists, were commonly formed in prosecution of some such
subtilties of reasoning as are here pointed out, and proceed as much from the
habit of scholastic refinement as from any corruption of the heart, if we may
follow the authority of Mons. ^Bayle^. See his Dictionary, article ^Loyola^. And
why has the indignation of mankind risen so high against these casuists; but
because every one perceived, that human society could not subsist were such
practices authorized, and that morals must always be handled with a view to
public interest, more than philosophical regularity? If the secret direction of
the intention, said every man of sense, could invalidate a contract; where is
our security? And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think, that, where an
intenintention was supposed to be requisite, if that intention really had not
place, no consequence ought to follow, and no obligation be imposed. The
casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the subtilties of lawyers, hinted
at above; but as the former are _pernicious_, and the latter _innocent_ and even
_necessary_, this is the reason of the very different reception they meet with
from the world.

{#n13.3,pages=200-1} It is a doctrine of the Church of ^Rome^, that the priest,
by a secret direction of his intention, can invalidate any sacrament. This
position is derived from a strict and regular prosecution of the obvious truth,
that empty words alone, without any meaning or intention in the speaker, can
never be attended with any effect. If the same conclusion be not admitted in
reasonings concerning civil contracts, where the affair is allowed to be of so
much less consequence than the eternal |salvation of thousands, it proceeds
entirely from men's sense of the danger and inconvenience of the doctrine in the
former case: And we may thence observe, that however positive, arrogant, and
dogmatical any superstition may appear, it never can convey any thorough
persuasion of the reality of its objects, or put them, in any degree, on a
balance with the common incidents of life, which we learn from daily observation
and experimental reasoning.
