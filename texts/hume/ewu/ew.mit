{#1,pages=533-4} THE elegant Part of Mankind, who are not immers'd in the animal
Life, but employ themselves in the Operations of the Mind, may be divided into
the _learned_ and _conversible_. The Learned are such as have chosen for their
Portion the higher and more difficult Operations of the Mind, which require
Leisure and Solitude, and cannot be brought to Perfection, without long
Preparation and severe Labour. The conversible World join to a sociable
Disposition, and a Taste of Pleasure, an Inclination to the easier and more
gentle Exercises of the Understanding, to obvious Reflections on human |Affairs,
and the Duties of common Life, and to the Observation of the Blemishes or
Perfections of the particular Objects, that surround them. Such Subjects of
Thought furnish not sufficient Employment in Solitude, but require the Company
and Conversation of our Fellow-Creatures, to render them a proper Exercise for
the Mind: And this brings Mankind together in Society, where every one displays
his Thoughts and Observations in the best Manner he is able, and mutually gives
and receives Information, as well as Pleasure.

{#2,pages=534} ^The^ Separation of the Learned from the conversible World seems
to have been the great Defect of the last Age, and must have had a very bad
Influence both on Books and Company: For what Possibility is there of finding
Topics of Conversation fit for the Entertainment of rational Creatures, without
having Recourse sometimes to History, Poetry, Politics, and the more obvious
Principles, at least, of Philosophy? Must our whole Discourse be a continued
Series of gossipping Stories and idle Remarks? Must the Mind never rise higher,
but be perpetuall 
""_Stun'd and worn out with endless Chat//
Of WILL did this, and NAN said that._""

{#3,pages=534} ^This^ wou'd be to render the Time spent in Company the most
unentertaining, as well as the most unprofitable Part of our Lives.

{#4,pages=534-5} ^On^ the other Hand, Learning has been as great a Loser by
being shut up in Colleges and Cells, and secluded from the World and good
Company. By that Means, every Thing of what we call _Belles Lettres_ became
totally barbarous, being cultivated by Men without any Taste of Life or Manners,
and without that Liberty and Facility of Thought and Expression, which can only
be acquir'd by Conversation. Even Philosophy went to Wrack by this moaping
recluse Method of Study, and became as chimerical in her Conclusions as she was
unin|telligible in her Stile and Manner of Delivery. And indeed, what cou'd be
expected from Men who never consulted Experience in any of their Reasonings, or
who never search'd for that Experience, where alone it is to be found, in common
Life and Conversation?

{#5,pages=535} '^Tis^ with great Pleasure I observe, That Men of Letters, in
this Age, have lost, in a great Measure, that Shyness and Bashfulness of Temper,
which kept them at a Distance from Mankind; and, at the same Time, That Men of
the World are proud of borrowing from Books their most agreeable Topics of
Conversation. 'Tis to be hop'd, that this League betwixt the learned and
conversible Worlds, which is so happily begun, will be still farther improv'd to
their mutual Advantage; and to that End, I know nothing more advantageous than
such _Essays_ as these with which I endeavour to entertain the Public. In this
View, I cannot but consider myself as a Kind of Resident or Ambassador from the
Dominions of Learning to those of Conversation; and shall think it my constant
Duty to promote a good Correspondence betwixt these two States, which have so
great a Dependence on each other. I shall give Intelligence to the Learned of
whatever passes in Company, and shall endeavour to import into Company whatever
Commodities I find in my native Country proper for their Use and Entertainment.
The Balance of Trade we need not be jealous of, nor will there be any Difficulty
to preserve it on both Sides. The Materials of this Commerce must chiefly be
furnish'd by Conversation and common Life: The manufacturing of them alone
belongs to Learning.

{#6,pages=535-6} ^As^ 'twou'd be an unpardonable Negligence in an Ambassador not
to pay his Respects to the Sovereign of the State where he is commission'd to
reside; so it wou'd be altogether inexcusable in me not to address myself, with
a particular Respect, to the Fair Sex, who are the Sovereigns of the Empire of
Conversation. I approach them with Reverence; and were not my Countrymen, the
Learned, a stubborn independent Race of Mortals, extremely jealous of their
Liberty, and unaccustom'd to Subjection, I shou'd resign into their fair Hands
|the sovereign Authority over the Republic of Letters. As the Case stands, my
Commission extends no farther, than to desire a League, offensive and defensive,
against our common Enemies, against the Enemies of Reason and Beauty, People of
dull Heads and cold Hearts. From this Moment let us pursue them with the
severest Vengeance: Let no Quarter be given, but to those of sound
Understandings and delicate Affections; and these Characters, 'tis to be
presum'd, we shall always find inseparable.

{#7,pages=536-7} ^To^ be serious, and to quit the Allusion before it be worn
thread-bare, I am of Opinion, that Women, that is, Women of Sense and Education
(for to such alone I address myself) are much better Judges of all polite
Writing than Men of the same Degree of Understanding; and that 'tis a vain
Pannic, if they be so far terrify'd with the common Ridicule that is levell'd
against learned Ladies, as utterly to abandon every Kind of Books and Study to
our Sex. Let the Dread of that Ridicule have no other Effect, than to make them
conceal their Knowledge before Fools, who are not worthy of it, nor of them.
Such will still presume upon the vain Title of the Male Sex to affect a
Superiority above them: But my fair Readers may be assur'd, that all Men of
Sense, who know the World, have a great Deference for their Judgment of such
Books as ly within the Compass of their Knowledge, and repose more Confidence in
the Delicacy of their Taste, tho' unguided by Rules, than in all the dull
Labours of Pedants and Commentators. In a neighbouring Nation, equally famous
for good Taste, and for Gallantry, the Ladies are, in a Manner, the Sovereigns
of the _learned_ World, as well as of the _conversible_; and no polite Writer
pretends to venture upon the Public, without the Approbation of some celebrated
Judges of that Sex. Their Verdict is, indeed, sometimes complain'd of; and, in
particular, I find, that the Admirers of _Corneille_, to save that great Poet's
Honour upon the Ascendant that _Racine_ began to take over him, always said,
That it was not to be expected, that so old a Man could dispute the Prize,
before such Judges, with so young a Man as his Rival. But this Observation has
been found |unjust, since Posterity seems to have ratify'd the Verdict of that
Tribunal: And _Racine_, tho' dead, is still the Favourite of the Fair Sex, as
well as of the best Judges among the Men.

{#8,pages=537} ^There^ is only one Subject, on which I am apt to distrust the
Judgment of Females, and that is, concerning Books of Gallantry and Devotion,
which they commonly affect as high flown as possible; and most of them seem more
delighted with the Warmth, than with the justness of the Passion. I mention
Gallantry and Devotion as the same Subject, because, in Reality, they become the
same when treated in this Manner; and we may observe, that they both depend upon
the very same Complexion. As the Fair Sex have a great Share of the tender and
amorous Disposition, it perverts their Judgment on this Occasion, and makes them
be easily affected, even by what has no Propriety in the Expression nor Nature
in the Sentiment. Mr. _Addison_'s elegant Discourses of Religion have no Relish
with them, in Comparison of Books of mystic Devotion: And _Otway_'s Tragedies
are rejected for the Rants of Mr. _Dryden_.

{#9,pages=537} Wou'd the Ladies correct their false Taste in this Particular;
Let them accustom themselves a little more to Books of all Kinds: Let them give
Encouragement to Men of Sense and Knowledge to frequent their Company: And
finally, let them concur heartily in that Union I have projected betwixt the
learned and conversible Worlds. They may, perhaps, meet with more Complaisance
from their usual Followers than from Men of Learning; but they cannot reasonably
expect so sincere an Affection: And, I hope, they will never be guilty of so
wrong a Choice, as to sacrifice the Substance to the Shadow.
