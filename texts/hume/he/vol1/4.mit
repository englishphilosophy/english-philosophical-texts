{#1} #1066. Consequences of the battle of Hastings# NOTHING could exceed the
consternation which seized the English, when they received intelligence of the
unfortunate battle of Hastings, the death of their king, the slaughter of their
principal nobility and of their bravest warriors, and the rout and dispersion of
the remainder. But though the loss, which they had sustained in that fatal
action, was considerable, it might have been repaired by a great nation; where
the people were generally armed, and where there resided so many powerful
noblemen in every province, who could have assembled their retainers, and |have
obliged the duke of Normandy to divide his army, and probably to waste it in a
variety of actions and rencounters. It was thus that the kingdom had formerly
resisted, for many years, its invaders, and had been gradually subdued, by the
continued efforts of the Romans, Saxons, and Danes; and equal difficulties might
have been apprehended by William in this bold and hazardous enterprize. But
there were several vices in the Anglo-Saxon constitution, which rendered it
difficult for the English to defend their liberties in so critical an emergency.
The people had in a great measure lost all national pride and spirit, by their
recent and long subjection to the Danes; and as Canute had, in the course of his
administration, much abated the rigors of conquest, and had governed them
equitably by their own laws, they regarded with the less terror the ignominy of
a foreign yoke, and deemed the inconveniences of submission less formidable than
those of bloodshed, war, and resistance. Their attachment also to the ancient
royal family had been much weakened by their habits of submission to the Danish
princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their acquiescence in his
usurpation. And as they had long been accustomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the
only heir of the Saxon line, as unfit to govern them even in times of order and
tranquillity; they could entertain small hopes of his being able to repair such
great losses as they had sustained, or to withstand the victorious arms of the
duke of Normandy.

{#2} ^That^ they might not, however, be altogether wanting to
themselves in this extreme necessity, the English took some steps towards
adjusting their disjointed government, and uniting themselves against the common
enemy. The two potent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who had fled to London with the
remains of the broken army, took the lead on this occasion: In concert with
Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, a man possessed of great authority, and of
ample revenues, they proclaimed Edgar, and endeavoured to put the people in a
posture of defence, and encourage them to resist the Normans[n1]. But the terror
of the late defeat, and the near neighbourhood of the invaders, encreased the
confusion, inseparable from great revolutions; and every resolution |proposed
was hasty, fluctuating, tumultuary; disconcerted by fear or faction; ill
planned, and worse executed.

{#3} ^William^, that his enemies might have no leisure to
recover from their consternation or unite their counsels, immediately put
himself in motion after his victory, and resolved to prosecute an enterprize,
which nothing but celerity and vigour could render finally successful. His first
attempt was against Romney, whose inhabitants he severely punished, on account
of their cruel treatment of some Norman seamen and soldiers, who had been
carried thither by stress of weather, or by a mistake in their course[n2]: And
foreseeing that his conquest of England might still be attended with many
difficulties and with much opposition, he deemed it necessary, before he should
advance farther into the country, to make himself master of Dover, which would
both secure him a retreat in case of adverse fortune, and afford him a safe
landing-place for such supplies as might be requisite for pushing his
advantages. The terror diffused by his victory at Hastings was so great, that
the garrison of Dover, though numerous and well provided, immediately
capitulated; and as the Normans, rushing in to take possession of the town,
hastily set fire to some of the houses, William, desirous to conciliate the
minds of the English by an appearance of lenity and justice, made compensation
to the inhabitants for their losses[n3].

{#4} ^The^ Norman army, being much distressed with a dysentery,
was obliged to remain here eight days; but the duke, on their recovery, advanced
with quick marches towards London, and by his approach encreased the confusions,
which were already so prevalent in the English counsels. The ecclesiastics in
particular, whose influence was great over the people, began to declare in his
favour, and as most of the bishops and dignified clergymen were even then
Frenchmen or Normans, the pope's bull, by which his enterprize was avowed and
hallowed, was now openly insisted on as a reason for general submission. The
superior learning of those prelates, which, during the Confessor's reign, had
raised them above the ignorant Saxons, made their opinions be received with
implicit faith; and a young prince, like Edgar, whose capacity was deemed so
mean, was but ill qualified to resist the impression, which they made on the
minds of the people. A repulse, which a |body of Londoners received from five
hundred Norman horse, renewed in the city the terror of the great defeat at
Hastings; the easy submission of all the inhabitants of Kent was an additional
discouragement to them; the burning of Southwark before their eyes made them
dread a like fate to their own city; and no man any longer entertained thoughts
but of immediate safety and of self-preservation. Even the earls, Edwin and
Morcar, in despair of making effectual resistance, retired with their troops to
their own provinces; and the people thenceforth disposed themselves unanimously
to yield to the victor. #Submission of the English.# As soon as
he passed the Thames at Wallingford, and reached Berkhamstead, Stigand, the
primate, made submissions to him: Before he came within sight of the city, all
the chief nobility, and Edgar Atheling himself, the new elected king, came into
his camp, and declared their intention of yielding to his authority[n4]. They
requested him to mount their throne, which they now considered as vacant; and
declared to him, that, as they had always been ruled by regal power, they
desired to follow, in this particular, the example of their ancestors, and knew
of no one more worthy than himself to hold the reins of government[n5].

{#5} ^Though^ this was the great object, to which the duke's
enterprize tended, he feigned to deliberate on the offer; and being desirous, at
first, of preserving the appearance of a legal administration, he wished to
obtain a more explicit and formal consent of the English nation[n6]: But Aimar
of Aquitain, a man equally respected for valour in the field, and for prudence
in council, remonstrating with him on the danger of delay in so critical a
conjuncture, he laid aside all farther scruples, and accepted of the crown which
was tendered him. Orders were immediately issued to prepare every thing for the
ceremony of his coronation; but as he was yet afraid to place entire confidence
in the Londoners, who were numerous and warlike, he meanwhile commanded
fortresses to be erected in order to curb the inhabitants, and to secure his
person and government[n7].

{#6} ^Stigand^ was not much in the duke's favour, both because
he had intruded into the see on the expulsion of Robert, the Norman, and because
he possessed such influence and authority over the English[n8] as might be
dangerous to a new established monarch. |William, therefore, pretending that the
primate had obtained his pall in an irregular manner from pope Benedict IX. who
was himself an usurper, refused to be consecrated by him, and conferred this
honour on Aldred, archbishop of York. Westminster abbey was the place appointed
for that magnificent ceremony; the most considerable of the nobility,
#26th Dec.# both English and Norman, attended the duke on this
occasion; Aldred in a short speech asked the former, whether they agreed to
accept of William as their king; the bishop of Coutance put the same question to
the latter; and both being answered with acclamations[n9], Aldred administered
to the duke the usual coronation oath, by which he bound himself to protect the
church, to administer justice, and to repress violence: He then anointed him and
put the crown upon his head[n10]. There appeared nothing but joy in the
countenance of the spectators: But in that very moment, there burst forth the
strongest symptoms of the jealousy and animosity which prevailed between the
nations, and which continually encreased during the reign of this prince. The
Norman soldiers, who were placed without in order to guard the church, hearing
the shouts within, fancied that the English were offering violence to their
duke; and they immediately assaulted the populace, and set fire to the
neighbouring houses. The alarm was conveyed to the nobility who surrounded the
prince; both English and Normans, full of apprehensions, rushed out to secure
themselves from the present danger; and it was with difficulty that William
himself was able to appease the tumult[n11].

{#7} #1067. Settlement of the government.# ^The^
king, thus possessed of the throne by a pretended destination of king Edward,
and by an irregular election of the people, but still more by force of arms,
retired from London to Berking in Essex; and there received the submissions of
all the nobility, who had not attended his coronation. Edric, sirnamed the
Forester, grand-nephew to that Edric so noted for his repeated acts of perfidy
during the reigns of Ethelred and Edmond; earl Coxo, a man famous for bravery;
even Edwin and Morcar, earls of Mercia and Northumberland; with the other
principal noblemen of England, came and swore fealty to him; were received into
|favour; and were confirmed in the possession of their estates and
dignities[n12]. Every thing bore the appearance of peace and tranquillity; and
William had no other occupation than to give contentment to the foreigners who
had assisted him to mount the throne, and to his new subjects, who had so
readily submitted to him.

{#8} ^He^ had got possession of the treasure of Harold, which
was considerable; and being also supplied with rich presents from the opulent
men in all parts of England, who were solicitous to gain the favour of their new
sovereign, he distributed great sums among his troops, and by this liberality
gave them hopes of obtaining at length those more durable establishments, which
they had expected from his enterprize[n13]. The ecclesiastics, both at home and
abroad, had much forwarded his success; and he failed not, in return, to express
his gratitude and devotion in the manner which was most acceptable to them: He
sent Harold's standard to the pope, accompanied with many valuable presents: All
the considerable monasteries and churches in France, where prayers had been put
up for his success, now tasted of his bounty[n14]: The English monks found him
well disposed to favour their order: And he built a new convent near Hastings,
which he called _Battle-Abbey,_ and which, on pretence of supporting monks to
pray for his own soul, and for that of Harold, served as a lasting memorial of
his victory[n15].

{#9} ^He^ introduced into England that strict execution of
justice, for which his administration had been much celebrated in Normandy; and
even during this violent revolution, every disorder or oppression met with
rigorous punishment[n16]. His army in particular was governed with severe
discipline; and notwithstanding the insolence of victory, care was taken to give
as little offence as possible to the jealousy of the vanquished. The king
appeared solicitous to unite in an amicable manner the Normans and the English,
by intermarriages and alliances; and all his new subjects who approached his
person were received with affability and regard. No signs of suspicion appeared,
not even towards Edgar Atheling, the heir of the ancient royal family, whom
William confirmed in the |honours of earl of Oxford, conferred on him by Harold,
and whom he affected to treat with the highest kindness, as nephew to the
Confessor, his great friend and benefactor. Though he confiscated the estates of
Harold, and of those who had fought in the battle of Hastings on the side of
that prince, whom he represented as an usurper, he seemed willing to admit of
every plausible excuse for past opposition to his pretensions, and he received
many into favour, who had carried arms against him. He confirmed the liberties
and immunities of London and the other cities of England; and appeared desirous
of replacing every thing on ancient establishments. In his whole administration,
he bore the semblance of the lawful prince, not of the conqueror; and the
English began to flatter themselves, that they had changed, not the form of
their government, but the succession only of their sovereigns, a matter which
gave them small concern. The better to reconcile his new subjects to his
authority, William made a progress through some parts of England; and besides a
splendid court and majestic presence, which overawed the people, already struck
with his military fame, the appearance of his clemency and justice gained the
approbation of the wise, attentive to the first steps of their new sovereign.

{#10} ^But^ amidst this confidence and friendship, which he
expressed for the English, the king took care to place all real power in the
hands of his Normans, and still to keep possession of the sword, to which, he
was sensible, he had owed his advancement to sovereign authority. He disarmed
the city of London and other places, which appeared most warlike and populous;
and building citadels in that capital, as well as in Winchester, Hereford, and
the cities best situated for commanding the kingdom, he quartered Norman
soldiers in all of them, and left no where any power able to resist or oppose
him. He bestowed the forfeited estates on the most eminent of his captains, and
established funds for the payment of his soldiers. And thus, while his civil
administration carried the face of a legal magistrate, his military institutions
were those of a master and tyrant; at least of one, who reserved to himself,
whenever he pleased, the power of assuming that character.

{#11} #King's return to Normandy.# ^By^ this
mixture, however, of vigour and lenity, he had so soothed the minds of the
English, that he thought he might safely revisit his native country, and enjoy
the triumph and congratulation of his ancient subjects. He left the
administration in the |hands of his uterine brother, Odo, bishop of Baieux,
#March.# and of William Fitz Osberne. That their authority might
be exposed to less danger, he carried over with him all the most considerable
nobility of England, who, while they served to grace his court by their presence
and magnificent retinues, were in reality hostages for the fidelity of the
nation. Among these, were Edgar Atheling, Stigand the primate, the earls Edwin
and Morcar, Waltheof, the son of the brave earl Siward, with others, eminent for
the greatness of their fortunes and families, or for their ecclesiastical and
civil dignities. He was visited at the abbey of Fescamp, where he resided during
some time, by Rodulph, uncle to the king of France, and by many powerful princes
and nobles, who, having contributed to his enterprize, were desirous of
participating in the joy and advantages of its success. His English courtiers,
willing to ingratiate themselves with their new sovereign, outvyed each other in
equipages and entertainments; and made a display of riches, which struck the
foreigners with astonishment. William of Poictiers, a Norman historian[n17], who
was present, speaks with admiration of the beauty of their persons, the size and
workmanship of their silver plate, the costliness of their embroideries, an art
in which the English then excelled; and he expresses himself in such terms, as
tend much to exalt our idea of the opulence and cultivation of the people[n18].
But though every thing bore the face of joy and festivity, and William himself
treated his new courtiers with great appearance of kindness, it was impossible
altogether to prevent the insolence of the Normans; and the English nobles
derived little satisfaction from those entertainments, where they considered
themselves as led in triumph by their ostentatious conqueror.

{#12} #Discontents of the English.# ^In^ England
affairs took still a worse turn during the absence of the sovereign. Discontents
and complaints multiplied every where; secret conspiracies were entered into
against the government; hostilities were already begun in many places; and every
thing seemed to menace a revolution as rapid as that which had placed William on
the throne. The historian above mentioned, who is a panegyrist of his master,
throws the blame entirely on the fickle and mutinous |disposition of the
English, and highly celebrates the justice and lenity of Odo's and Fitz
Osberne's administration[n19]. But other historians, with more probability,
impute the cause chiefly to the Normans, who, despising a people that had so
easily submitted to the yoke, envying their riches, and grudging the restraints
imposed upon their own rapine, were desirous of provoking them to a rebellion,
by which they expected to acquire new confiscations and forfeitures, and to
gratify those unbounded hopes, which they had formed in entering on this
enterprize[n20].

{#13} ^It^ is evident, that the chief reason of this alteration
in the sentiments of the English, must be ascribed to the departure of William,
who was alone able to curb the violence of his captains, and to overawe the
mutinies of the people. Nothing indeed appears more strange, than that this
prince, in less than three months after the conquest of a great, warlike, and
turbulent nation, should absent himself, in order to revisit his own country,
which remained in profound tranquillity, and was not menaced by any of its
neighbours; and should so long leave his jealous subjects at the mercy of an
insolent and licentious army. Were we not assured of the solidity of his genius,
and the good sense displayed in all other circumstances of his conduct, we might
ascribe this measure to a vain ostentation, which rendered him impatient to
display his pomp and magnificence among his ancient subjects. It is therefore
more natural to believe, that, in so extraordinary a step, he was guided by a
concealed policy; and that, though he had thought proper at first to allure the
people to submission by the semblance of a legal administration, he found, that
he could neither satisfy his rapacious captains, nor secure his unstable
government, without farther exerting the rights of conquest, and seizing the
possessions of the English. In order to have a pretext for this violence, he
endeavoured, without discovering his intentions, to provoke and allure them into
insurrections, which, he thought, could never prove dangerous, while he detained
all the principal nobility in Normandy, while a great and victorious army was
quartered in England, and while he himself was so near to suppress any tumult or
rebellion. But as no ancient writer has ascribed this tyrannical purpose to
William, it scarcely seems allowable, from conjecture alone, to throw such an
imputation upon him.

{#14} #Their insurrections.# ^But^ whether we are
to account for that measure from the king's vanity or from his policy, it was
the immediate cause of all the calamities which the English endured during this
and the subsequent reigns, and gave rise to those mutual jealousies and
animosities between them and the Normans, which were never appeased, till a long
tract of time had gradually united the two nations, and made them one people.
The inhabitants of Kent, who had first submitted to the Conqueror, were the
first that attempted to throw off the yoke; and in confederacy with Eustace,
count of Bologne, who had also been disgusted by the Normans, they made an
attempt, though without success, on the garrison of Dover[n21]. Edric, the
Forester, whose possessions lay on the banks of the Severne, being provoked at
the depredations of some Norman captains in his neighbourhood, formed an
alliance with Blethyn and Rowallan, two Welsh princes; and endeavoured, with
their assistance, to repel force by force[n22]. But though these open
hostilities were not very considerable, the disaffection was general among the
English, who had become sensible, though too late, of their defenceless
condition, and began already to experience those insults and injuries, which a
nation must always expect, that allows itself to be reduced to that abject
situation. A secret conspiracy was entered into to perpetrate in one day a
general massacre of the Normans, like that which had formerly been executed upon
the Danes; and the quarrel was become so general and national, that the vassals
of earl Coxo, having desired him to head them in an insurrection, and finding
him resolute in maintaining his fidelity to William, put him to death as a
traitor to his country.

{#15} #Decemb. 6.# ^The^ king, informed of these
dangerous discontents, hastened over to England; and by his presence, and the
vigorous measures which he pursued, disconcerted all the schemes of the
conspirators. Such of them as had been more violent in their mutiny betrayed
their guilt, by flying or concealing themselves; and the confiscation of their
estates, while it encreased the number of malcontents, both enabled William to
gratify farther the rapacity of his Norman captains, and gave them the prospect
of new forfeitures and attainders. The king began to regard all his English
subjects as inveterate and irreclaimable enemies; and thenceforth either
embraced, or was more fully confirmed in the resolution, of |seizing their
possessions, and of reducing them to the most abject slavery. Though the natural
violence and severity of his temper made him incapable of feeling any remorse in
the execution of this tyrannical purpose, he had art enough to conceal his
intention, and to preserve still some appearance of justice in his oppressions.
He ordered all the English, who had been arbitrarily expelled by the Normans,
during his absence, to be restored to their estates[n23]: But at the same time,
he imposed a general tax on the people, that of Danegelt, which had been
abolished by the Confessor, and which had always been extremely odious to the
nation[n24].

{#16} #1068.# ^As^ the vigilance of William
overawed the malcontents, their insurrections were more the result of an
impatient humour in the people, than of any regular conspiracy, which could give
them a rational hope of success against the established power of the Normans.
The inhabitants of Exeter, instigated by Githa, mother to king Harold, refused
to admit a Norman garrison, and betaking themselves to arms, were strengthened
by the accession of the neighbouring inhabitants of Devonshire and Cornwal[n25].
The king hastened with his forces to chastize this revolt; and on his approach,
the wiser and more considerable citizens, sensible of the unequal contest,
persuaded the people to submit, and to deliver hostages for their obedience. A
sudden mutiny of the populace broke this agreement; and William, appearing
before the walls, ordered the eyes of one of the hostages to be put out, as an
earnest of that severity, which the rebels must expect, if they persevered in
their revolt[n26]. The inhabitants were anew seized with terror, and
surrendering at discretion, threw themselves at the king's feet, and supplicated
his clemency and forgiveness. William was not destitute of generosity, when his
temper was not hardened either by policy or passion: He was prevailed on to
pardon the rebels, and he set guards on all the gates, in order to prevent the
rapacity and insolence of his soldiery[n27]. Githa escaped with her treasures to
Flanders. The malcontents of Cornwal imitated the example of Exeter, and met
with like treatment: And the king, having built a citadel in that city, which he
put under the command of Baldwin, |son of earl Gilbert, returned to Winchester,
and dispersed his army into their quarters. He was here joined by his wife,
Matilda, who had not before visited England, and whom he now ordered to be
crowned by archbishop Aldred. Soon after, she brought him an accession to his
family, by the birth of a fourth son, whom he named Henry. His three elder sons,
Robert, Richard, and William, still resided in Normandy.

{#17} ^But^ though the king appeared thus fortunate both in
public and domestic life, the discontents of his English subjects augmented
daily; and the injuries, committed and suffered on both sides, rendered the
quarrel between them and the Normans absolutely incurable. The insolence of
victorious masters, dispersed throughout the kingdom, seemed intolerable to the
natives; and where-ever they found the Normans, separate or assembled in small
bodies, they secretly set upon them, and gratified their vengeance by the
slaughter of their enemies. But an insurrection in the north drew thither the
general attention, and seemed to threaten more important consequences. Edwin and
Morcar appeared at the head of this rebellion; and these potent noblemen, before
they took arms, stipulated for foreign succours, from their nephew Blethin,
prince of North-Wales, from Malcolm, king of Scotland, and from Sweyn, king of
Denmark. Besides the general discontent, which had seized the English; the two
earls were incited to this revolt by private injuries. William, in order to
insure them to his interests, had, on his accession, promised his daughter in
marriage to Edwin; but either he had never seriously intended to perform this
engagement, or having changed his plan of administration in England from
clemency to rigour, he thought it was to little purpose, if he gained one
family, while he enraged the whole nation. When Edwin, therefore, renewed his
applications, he gave him an absolute denial[n28]; and this disappointment,
added to so many other reasons of disgust, induced that nobleman and his brother
to concur with their incensed countrymen, and to make one general effort for the
recovery of their ancient liberties. William knew the importance of celerity in
quelling an insurrection, supported by such powerful leaders, and so agreeable
to the wishes of the people; and having his troops always in readiness, he
advanced |by great journies to the north. On his march he gave orders to fortify
the castle of Warwic, of which he left Henry de Beaumont governor, and that of
Nottingham, which he committed to the custody of William Peverell, another
Norman captain[n29]. He reached York before the rebels were in any condition for
resistance, or were joined by any of the foreign succours, which they expected,
except a small reinforcement from Wales[n30]; and the two earls found no means
of safety, but having recourse to the clemency of the victor. Archil, a potent
nobleman in those parts, imitated their example, and delivered his son as a
hostage for his fidelity[n31]; nor were the people, thus deserted by their
leaders, able to make any farther resistance. But the treatment, which William
gave the chiefs, was very different from that which fell to the share of their
followers. He observed religiously the terms, which he had granted to the
former; and allowed them, for the present, to keep possession of their estates;
but he extended the rigors of his confiscations over the latter, and gave away
their lands to his foreign adventurers. These, planted throughout the whole
country, and in possession of the military power, left Edwin and Morcar, whom he
pretended to spare, destitute of all support, and ready to fall, whenever he
should think proper to command their ruin. A peace, which he made with Malcolm,
who did him homage for Cumberland, seemed, at the same time, to deprive them of
all prospect of foreign assistance[n32].

{#18} #Rigors of the Norman government.# ^The^
English were now sensible that their final destruction was intended; and that,
instead of a sovereign, whom they had hoped to gain by their submission, they
had tamely surrendered themselves, without resistance, to a tyrant and a
conqueror. Though the early confiscation of Harold's followers might seem
iniquitous; being inflicted on men who had never sworn fealty to the duke of
Normandy, who were ignorant of his pretensions, and who only fought in defence
of the government, which they themselves had established in their own country:
Yet were these rigors, however contrary to the ancient Saxon laws, excused on
account of the urgent necessities of the prince; and those who were not involved
in the present ruin, hoped, that they should thenceforth enjoy without
molestation their possessions and their dignities. But the |successive
destruction of so many other families convinced them, that the king intended to
rely entirely on the support and affections of foreigners; and they foresaw new
forfeitures, attainders, and acts of violence, as the necessary result of this
destructive plan of administration. They observed, that no Englishman possessed
his confidence, or was entrusted with any command or authority; and that the
strangers, whom a rigorous discipline could have but ill restrained, were
encouraged in their insolence and tyranny against them. The easy submission of
the kingdom on its first invasion had exposed the natives to contempt; the
subsequent proofs of their animosity and resentment had made them the object of
hatred; and they were now deprived of every expedient, by which they could hope
to make themselves either regarded or beloved by their sovereign. Impressed with
the sense of this dismal situation, many Englishmen fled into foreign countries,
with an intention of passing their lives abroad free from oppression, or of
returning on a favourable opportunity to assist their friends in the recovery of
their native liberties[n33]. Edgar Atheling himself, dreading the insidious
caresses of William, was persuaded by Cospatric, a powerful Northumbrian, to
escape with him into Scotland; and he carried thither his two sisters Margaret
and Christina. They were well received by Malcolm, who soon after espoused
Margaret, the elder sister; and partly with a view of strengthening his kingdom
by the accession of so many strangers, partly in hopes of employing them against
the growing power of William, he gave great countenance to all the English
exiles. Many of them settled there; and laid the foundation of families which
afterwards made a figure in that country.

{#19} ^While^ the English suffered under these oppressions, even
the foreigners were not much at their ease; but finding themselves surrounded on
all hands by enraged enemies, who took every advantage against them, and menaced
them with still more bloody effects of the public resentment, they began to wish
again for the tranquillity and security of their native country. Hugh de
Grentmesnil, and Humphry de Teliol, though entrusted with great commands,
desired to be dismissed the service; and some others imitated their example: A
desertion which was highly resented by the |king, and which he punished by the
confiscation of all their possessions in England[n34]. But William's bounty to
his followers could not fail of alluring many new adventurers into his service;
and the rage of the vanquished English served only to excite the attention of
the king and those warlike chiefs, and keep them in readiness to suppress every
commencement of domestic rebellion or foreign invasion.

{#20} #1069. New insurrections.# ^It^ was not
long before they found occupation for their prowess and military conduct.
Godwin, Edmond, and Magnus, three sons of Harold, had, immediately after the
defeat at Hastings, sought a retreat in Ireland; where, having met with a kind
reception from Dermot and other princes of that country, they projected an
invasion on England, and they hoped that all the exiles from Denmark, Scotland,
and Wales, assisted by forces from these several countries, would at once
commence hostilities, and rouze the indignation of the English against their
haughty conquerors. They landed in Devonshire; but found Brian, son of the count
of Britanny, at the head of some foreign troops, ready to oppose them; and being
defeated in several actions, they were obliged to retreat to their ships, and to
return with great loss to Ireland[n35]. The efforts of the Normans were now
directed to the north, where affairs had fallen into the utmost confusion. The
more impatient of the Northumbrians had attacked Robert de Comyn, who was
appointed governor of Durham; and gaining the advantage over him from his
negligence, they put him to death in that city, with seven hundred of his
followers[n36]. This success animated the inhabitants of York, who, rising in
arms, slew Robert Fitz-Richard, their governor[n37]; and besieged in the castle
William Mallet, on whom the command now devolved. A little after, the Danish
troops landed from 300 vessels: Osberne, brother to king Sweyn, was entrusted
with the command of these forces, and he was accompanied by Harold and Canute,
two sons of that monarch. Edgar Atheling appeared from Scotland, and brought
along with him Cospatric, Waltheof, Siward, Bearne, Merleswain, Adelin, and
other leaders, who, partly from the hopes which they gave of Scottish succours,
partly from their authority in those parts, |easily persuaded the warlike and
discontented Northumbrians to join the insurrection. Mallet, that he might
better provide for the defence of the citadel of York, set fire to some houses,
which lay contiguous; but this expedient proved the immediate cause of his
destruction. The flames, spreading into the neighbouring streets, reduced the
whole city to ashes: The enraged inhabitants, aided by the Danes, took advantage
of the confusion to attack the castle, which they carried by assault; and the
garrison, to the number of 3000 men, was put to the sword without mercy[n38].

{#21} ^This^ success proved a signal to many other parts of
England, and gave the people an opportunity of showing their malevolence to the
Normans. Hereward, a nobleman in East-Anglia, celebrated for valour, assembled
his followers, and taking shelter in the Isle of Ely, made inroads on all the
neighbouring country[n39]. The English in the counties of Somerset and Dorset
rose in arms, and assaulted Montacute, the Norman governor; while the
inhabitants of Cornwal and Devon invested Exeter, which, from the memory of
William's clemency, still remained faithful to him. Edric, the forester, calling
in the assistance of the Welsh, laid siege to Shrewsbury, and made head against
earl Brient and Fitz-Osberne, who commanded in those quarters[n40]. The English
every where, repenting their former easy submission, seemed determined to make
by concert one great effort for the recovery of their liberties, and for the
expulsion of their oppressors.

{#22} ^William^, undismayed amidst this scene of confusion,
assembled his forces, and animating them with the prospect of new confiscations
and forfeitures, he marched against the rebels in the north, whom he regarded as
the most formidable, and whose defeat he knew would strike a terror into all the
other malcontents. Joining policy to force, he tried, before his approach, to
weaken the enemy, by detaching the Danes from them; and he engaged Osberne, by
large presents, and by offering him the liberty of plundering the sea-coast, to
retire, without committing farther hostilities, into Denmark[n41]. Cospatric
also, in despair of success, made his peace with the king, and paying a sum of
money as an atonement for his insurrection, was received into favour, and even
invested with the |earldom of Northumberland. Waltheof, who long defended York
with great courage, was allured with this appearance of clemency; and as William
knew how to esteem valour even in an enemy, that nobleman had no reason to
repent of this confidence[n42]. Even Edric, compelled by necessity, submitted to
the Conqueror, and received forgiveness, which was soon after followed by some
degree of trust and favour. Malcolm, coming too late to support his
confederates, was constrained to retire; and all the English rebels in other
parts, except Hereward, who still kept in his fastnesses, dispersed themselves,
and left the Normans undisputed masters of the kingdom. Edgar Atheling, with his
followers, sought again a retreat in Scotland from the pursuit of his enemies.

{#23} #1070. New rigors of the government.# ^But^
the seeming clemency of William towards the English leaders proceeded only from
artifice, or from his esteem of individuals: His heart was hardened against all
compassion towards the people; and he scrupled no measure, however violent or
severe, which seemed requisite to support his plan of tyrannical administration.
Sensible of the restless disposition of the Northumbrians, he determined to
incapacitate them ever after from giving him disturbance, and he issued orders
for laying entirely waste that fertile country, which, for the extent of sixty
miles, lies between the Humber and the Tees[n43]. The houses were reduced to
ashes by the merciless Normans, the cattle seized and driven away; the
instruments of husbandry destroyed; and the inhabitants compelled either to seek
for a subsistence in the southern parts of Scotland, or if they lingered in
England, from a reluctance to abandon their ancient habitations, they perished
miserably in the woods from cold and hunger. The lives of a hundred thousand
persons are computed to have been sacrificed to this stroke of barbarous
policy[n44], which, by seeking a remedy for a temporary evil, thus inflicted a
lasting wound on the power and populousness of the nation.

{#24} ^But^ William, finding himself entirely master of a
people, who had given him such sensible proofs of their impotent rage and
animosity now resolved to proceed to extremities against all the |natives of
England; and to reduce them to a condition, in which they should no longer be
formidable to his government. The insurrections and conspiracies in so many
parts of the kingdom had involved the bulk of the landed proprietors, more or
less, in the guilt of treason; and the king took advantage of executing against
them, with the utmost rigour, the laws of forfeiture and attainder. Their lives
were indeed commonly spared; but their estates were confiscated, and either
annexed to the royal demesnes, or conferred with the most profuse bounty on the
Normans and other foreigners[n45]. While the king's declared intention was to
depress or rather entirely extirpate the English gentry[n46], it is easy to
believe that scarcely the form of justice would be observed in those violent
proceedings[n47]; and that any suspicions served as the most undoubted proofs of
guilt against a people thus devoted to destruction. It was crime sufficient in
an Englishman to be opulent or noble or powerful; and the policy of the king,
concurring with the rapacity of foreign adventurers, produced almost a total
revolution in the landed property of the kingdom. Ancient and honourable
families were reduced to beggary; the nobles themselves were every where treated
with ignominy and contempt; they had the mortification of seeing their castles
and manors possessed by Normans of the meanest birth and lowest stations[n48];
and they found themselves carefully excluded from every road, which led either
to riches or preferment[n49].

{#25} #Introduction of the feudal law.# ^As^
power naturally follows property, this revolution alone gave great security to
the foreigners; but William, by the new institutions which he established, took
also care to retain for ever the military authority in those hands, which had
enabled him to subdue the kingdom. He introduced into England the feudal law,
which he found established in France and Normandy, and which, during that age,
was the foundation both of the stability and of the disorders, in most of the
monarchial governments of Europe. He divided all the lands of England, with very
few exceptions, beside the royal demesnes, into baronies; and he conferred
these, with the reservation of stated services and payments, on the most
considerable of his adventurers. These great barons, who held immediately |of
the crown, shared out a great part of their lands to other foreigners, who were
denominated knights or vassals, and who paid their lord the same duty and
submission in peace and war, which he himself owed to his sovereign. The whole
kingdom contained about 700 chief tenants, and 60,215 knights-fees[n50]; and as
none of the native English were admitted into the first rank, the few, who
retained their landed property, were glad to be received into the second, and
under the protection of some powerful Norman, to load themselves and their
posterity with this grievous burthen, for estates which they had received free
from their ancestors[n51]. The small mixture of English, which entered into this
civil or military fabric, (for it partook of both species) was so restrained by
subordination under the foreigners, that the Norman dominion seemed now to be
fixed on the most durable basis, and to defy all the efforts of its enemies.

{#26} ^The^ better to unite the parts of the government, and to
bind them into one system, which might serve both for defence against
foreigners, and for the support of domestic tranquillity, William reduced the
ecclesiastical revenues under the same feudal law; and though he had courted the
church on his invasion and accession, he now subjected it to services, which the
clergy regarded as a grievous slavery, and as totally unbefitting their
profession. The bishops and abbots were obliged, when required, to furnish to
the king during war a number of knights or military tenants, proportioned to the
extent of property possessed by each see or abbey; and they were liable, in case
of failure, to the same penalties which were exacted from the laity[n52]. The
pope and the ecclesiastics exclaimed against this tyranny, as they called it;
but the king's authority was so well established over the army, who held every
thing from his bounty, that superstition itself, even in that age, when it was
most prevalent, was constrained to bend under his superior influence.

{#27} ^But^ as the great body of the clergy were still natives,
the king had much reason to dread the effects of their resentment: He therefore
used the precaution of expelling the English from all the |considerable
dignities, and of advancing foreigners in their place. The partiality of the
Confessor towards the Normans had been so great, that, aided by their superior
learning, it had promoted them to many of the sees in England; and even before
the period of the conquest, scarcely more than six or seven of the prelates were
natives of the country. But among these was Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury; a
man, who, by his address and vigour, by the greatness of his family and
alliances, by the extent of his possessions, as well as by the dignity of his
office, and his authority among the English, gave jealousy to the king[n53].
Though William had, on his accession, affronted this prelate, by employing the
archbishop of York to officiate at his consecration, he was careful, on other
occasions, to load him with honours and caresses, and to avoid giving him
farther offence till the opportunity should offer of effecting his final
destruction[n54]. The suppression of the late rebellions, and the total
subjection of the English, made him hope, that an attempt against Stigand,
however violent, would be covered by his great successes, and be overlooked
amidst the other important revolutions, which affected so deeply the property
and liberty of the kingdom. Yet, notwithstanding these great advantages, he did
not think it safe to violate the reverence usually paid to the primate, but
under cover of a new superstition, which he was the great instrument of
introducing into England.

{#28} #Innovation in ecclesiastical government.#
^The^ doctrine, which exalted the papacy above all human power, had gradually
diffused itself from the city and court of Rome; and was, during that age, much
more prevalent in the southern than in the northern kingdoms of Europe. Pope
Alexander, who had assisted William in his conquests, naturally expected, that
the French and Normans would import into England, the same reverence for his
sacred character, with which they were impressed in their own country; and would
break the spiritual, as well as civil independency of the Saxons, who had
hitherto conducted their ecclesiastical government, with an acknowledgment
indeed of primacy in the see of Rome, but without much idea of its title to
dominion or authority. As soon, therefore, as the Norman prince seemed fully
established on the throne, the Pope dispatched Ermenfroy, bishop of Sion, as his
legate into England; and |this prelate was the first that had ever appeared with
that character in any part of the British islands. The king, though he was
probably led by principle to pay this submission to Rome, determined, as is
usual, to employ the incident as a means of serving his political purposes, and
of degrading those English prelates, who were become obnoxious to him. The
legate submitted to become the instrument of his tyranny; and thought, that the
more violent the exertion of power, the more certainly did it confirm the
authority of that court, from which he derived his commission. He summoned,
therefore, a council of the prelates and abbots at Winchester; and being
assisted by two cardinals, Peter and John, he cited before him Stigand,
archbishop of Canterbury, to answer for his conduct. The primate was accused of
three crimes; the holding of the see of Winchester together with that of
Canterbury; the officiating in the pall of Robert, his predecessor; and the
having received his own pall from Benedict IX. who was afterwards deposed for
symony, and for intrusion into the papacy[n55]. These crimes of Stigand were
mere pretences; since the first had been a practice not unusual in England, and
was never any where subjected to a higher penalty than a resignation of one of
the sees; the second was a pure ceremonial; and as Benedict was the only pope
who then officiated, and his acts were never repealed, all the prelates of the
church, especially those who lay at a distance, were excusable for making their
applications to him. Stigand's ruin, however, was resolved on, and was
prosecuted with great severity. The legate degraded him from his dignity: The
king confiscated his estate, and cast him into prison, where he continued, in
poverty and want, during the remainder of his life. Like rigour was exercised
against the other English prelates: Agelric, bishop of Selesey, and Agelmare, of
Elmham, were deposed by the legate, and imprisoned by the king. Many
considerable abbots shared the same fate: Egelwin, bishop of Durham, fled the
kingdom: Wulstan, of Worcester, a man of an inoffensive character, was the only
English prelate that escaped this general proscription[n56], and remained in
|possession of his dignity. Aldred, archbishop of York, who had set the crown on
William's head, had died a little before of grief and vexation, and had left his
malediction to that prince, on account of the breach of his coronation oath, and
of the extreme tyranny with which, he saw, he was determined to treat his
English subjects[n57].

{#29} ^It^ was a fixed maxim in this reign, as well as in some
of the subsequent, that no native of the island should ever be advanced to any
dignity, ecclesiastical, civil, or military[n58]. The king therefore, upon
Stigand's deposition, promoted Lanfranc, a Milanese monk, celebrated for his
learning and piety, to the vacant see. This prelate was rigid in defending the
prerogatives of his station; and after a long process before the pope, he
obliged Thomas, a Norman monk, who had been appointed to the see of York, to
acknowledge the primacy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Where ambition can be
so happy as to cover its enterprizes, even to the person himself, under the
appearance of principle, it is the most incurable and inflexible of all human
passions. Hence Lanfranc's zeal in promoting the interests of the papacy, by
which he himself augmented his own authority, was indefatigable; and met with
proportionable success. The devoted attachment to Rome continually encreased in
England; and being favoured by the sentiments of the conquerors, as well as by
the monastic establishments formerly introduced by Edred and by Edgar, it soon
reached the same height, at which it had, during some time, stood in France and
Italy[n59]. It afterwards went much farther; being favoured by that very remote
situation, which had at first obstructed its progress; and being less checked by
knowledge and a liberal education, which were still somewhat more common in the
southern countries.

{#30} ^The^ prevalence of this superstitious spirit became
dangerous to some of William's successors, and incommodious to most of them: But
the arbitrary sway of this king over the English, and his extensive authority
over the foreigners, kept him from feeling any immediate |inconveniencies from
it. He retained the church in great subjection, as well as his lay subjects; and
would allow none, of whatever character, to dispute his sovereign will and
pleasure. He prohibited his subjects from acknowledging any one for pope whom he
himself had not previously received: He required, that all the ecclesiastical
canons, voted in any synod, should first be laid before him, and be ratified by
his authority: Even bulls or letters from Rome could not legally be produced,
till they received the same sanction: And none of his ministers or barons,
whatever offences they were guilty of, could be subjected to spiritual censures,
till he himself had given his consent to their excommunication[n60]. These
regulations were worthy of a sovereign, and kept united the civil and
ecclesiastical powers, which the principles, introduced by this prince himself,
had an immediate tendency to separate.

{#31} ^But^ the English had the cruel mortification to find,
that their king's authority, however acquired or however extended, was all
employed in their oppression; and that the scheme of their subjection, attended
with every circumstance of insult and indignity[n61], was deliberately formed by
the prince, and wantonly prosecuted by his followers[n62]. William had even
entertained the difficult project of totally abolishing the English language;
and, for that purpose, he ordered, that, in all schools throughout the kingdom,
the youth should be instructed in the French tongue, a practice which was
continued from custom till after the reign of Edward III. and was never indeed
totally discontinued in England. The pleadings in the supreme courts of
judicature were in French[n63]: The deeds were often drawn in the same language:
The laws were composed in that idiom[n64]: No other tongue was used at court: It
became the language of all fashionable company; and the English themselves,
ashamed of their own country, affected to excel in that foreign dialect. From
this attention of William, and from the extensive foreign dominions, long
annexed to the crown of England, proceeded that mixture of French, which is at
present to be found in the English tongue, and which composes the greatest and
best part |of our language. But amidst those endeavours to depress the English
nation, the king, moved by the remonstrances of some of his prelates, and by the
earnest desires of the people, restored a few of the laws of king Edward[n65];
which, though seemingly of no great importance towards the protection of general
liberty, gave them extreme satisfaction, as a memorial of their ancient
government, and an unusual mark of complaisance in their imperious
conquerors[n66].

{#32} #1071.# ^The^ situation of the two great
earls, Morcar and Edwin, became now very disagreeable. Though they had retained
their allegiance, during this general insurrection of their countrymen, they had
not gained the king's confidence, and they found themselves exposed to the
malignity of the courtiers, who envied them on account of their opulence and
greatness, and at the same time involved them in that general contempt which
they entertained for the English. Sensible that they had entirely lost their
dignity, and could not even hope to remain long in safety; they determined,
though too late, to share the same fate with their countrymen. While Edwin
retired to his estate in the north, with a view of commencing an insurrection,
Morcar took shelter in the Isle of Ely with the brave Hereward, who, secured by
the inaccessible situation of the place, still defended himself against the
Normans. But this attempt served only to accelerate the ruin of the few English,
who had hitherto been able to preserve their rank or fortune during the past
convulsions. William employed all his endeavours to subdue the Isle of Ely; and
having surrounded it with flat-bottomed boats, and made a causeway through the
morasses to the extent of two miles, he obliged the rebels to surrender at
discretion. Hereward alone forced his way, sword in hand, through the enemy; and
still continued his hostilities by sea against the Normans, till at last
William, charmed with his bravery, received him into favour, and restored him to
his estate. Earl Morcar, and Egelwin, bishop of Durham, who had joined the
malcontents, were thrown into prison, and the latter soon after died in
confinement. Edwin, attempting to make his escape into Scotland, was betrayed by
some of his followers; and was killed by a party of Normans, to |the great
affliction of the English, and even to that of William, who paid a tribute of
generous tears to the memory of this gallant and beautiful youth. The king of
Scotland, in hopes of profiting by these convulsions, had fallen upon the
northern counties; but on the approach of William he retired; and when the king
entered his country, he was glad to make peace, and to pay the usual homage to
the English crown. To complete the king's prosperity, Edgar Atheling himself,
despairing of success, and weary of a fugitive life, submitted to his enemy; and
receiving a decent pension for his subsistence, was permitted to live in England
unmolested. But these acts of generosity towards the leaders were disgraced, as
usual, by William's rigour against the inferior malcontents. He ordered the
hands to be lopt off, and the eyes to be put out, of many of the prisoners, whom
he had taken in the Isle of Ely; and he dispersed them in that miserable
condition throughout the country, as monuments of his severity.

{#33} #1073.# ^The^ province of Maine in France
had, by the will of Hebert, the last count, fallen under the dominion of William
some years before his conquest of England; but the inhabitants, dissatisfied
with the Norman government, and instigated by Fulk count of Anjou, who had some
pretensions to the succession, now rose in rebellion, and expelled the
magistrates, whom the king had placed over them. The full settlement of England
afforded him leisure to punish this insult on his authority; but being unwilling
to remove his Norman forces from this island, he carried over a considerable
army, composed almost entirely of English, and joining them to some troops
levied in Normandy, he entered the revolted province. The English appeared
ambitious of distinguishing themselves on this occasion, and of retrieving that
character of valour, which had long been national among them; but which their
late easy subjection under the Normans had somewhat degraded and obscured.
Perhaps too they hoped that, by their zeal and activity, they might recover the
confidence of their sovereign, as their ancestors had formerly, by like means,
gained the affections of Canute; and might conquer his inveterate prejudices in
favour of his own countrymen. The king's military conduct, seconded by these
brave troops, soon overcame all opposition in Maine: The inhabitants were
obliged to submit, and the count of Anjou relinquished his pretensions.

{#34} #1074. Insurrection of the Norman barons.#
^But^ during these transactions, the government of England was greatly
disturbed; and that too by those very foreigners, who owed every thing to the
king's bounty, and who were the sole object of his friendship and regard. The
Norman barons, who had engaged with their duke in the conquest of England, were
men of the most independant spirit; and though they obeyed their leader in the
field, they would have regarded with disdain the richest acquisitions, had they
been required, in return, to submit, in their civil government, to the arbitrary
will of one man. But the imperious character of William, encouraged by his
absolute dominion over the English, and often impelled by the necessity of his
affairs, had prompted him to stretch his authority over the Normans themselves
beyond what the free genius of that victorious people could easily bear. The
discontents were become general among those haughty nobles; and even Roger, earl
of Hereford, son and heir of Fitz-Osberne, the king's chief favourite, was
strongly infected with them. This nobleman, intending to marry his sister to
Ralph de Guader, earl of Norfolk, had thought it his duty to inform the king of
his purpose, and to desire the royal consent; but meeting with a refusal, he
proceeded nevertheless to complete the nuptials, and assembled all his friends,
and those of Guader, to attend the solemnity. The two earls, disgusted by the
denial of their request, and dreading William's resentment for their
disobedience, here prepared measures for a revolt; and during the gaiety of the
festival, while the company was heated with wine, they opened the design to
their guests. They inveighed against the arbitrary conduct of the king; his
tyranny over the English, whom they affected on this occasion to commiserate;
his imperious behaviour to his barons of the noblest birth; and his apparent
intention of reducing the victors and the vanquished to a like ignominious
servitude. Amidst their complaints, the indignity of submitting to a
bastard[n67] was not forgotten; the certain prospect of success in a revolt, by
the assistance of the Danes and the discontented English, was insisted on; and
the whole company, inflamed with the same sentiments, and warmed by the jollity
of the entertainment, entered, by a solemn engagement, into the design of
shaking off the royal authority. |Even earl Waltheof, who was present,
inconsiderately expressed his approbation of the conspiracy, and promised his
concurrence towards its success.

{#35} ^This^ nobleman, the last of the English, who, for some
generations, possessed any power or authority, had, after his capitulation at
York, been received into favour by the Conqueror; had even married Judith, niece
to that prince; and had been promoted to the earldoms of Huntingdon and
Northampton[n68]. Cospatric, earl of Northumberland, having, on some new disgust
from William, retired into Scotland, where he received the earldom of Dunbar
from the bounty of Malcolm; Waltheof was appointed his successor in that
important command, and seemed still to possess the confidence and friendship of
his sovereign[n69]. But as he was a man of generous principles, and loved his
country, it is probable, that the tyranny exercised over the English lay heavy
upon his mind, and destroyed all the satisfaction, which he could reap from his
own grandeur and advancement. When a prospect, therefore, was opened of
retrieving their liberty, he hastily embraced it; while the fumes of the liquor,
and the ardour of the company, prevented him from reflecting on the consequences
of that rash attempt. But after his cool judgment returned, he foresaw, that the
conspiracy of those discontented barons was not likely to prove successful
against the established power of William; or if it did, that the slavery of the
English, instead of being alleviated by that event, would become more grievous,
under a multitude of foreign leaders, factious and ambitious, whose union and
whose discord would be equally oppressive to the people. Tormented with these
reflections, he opened his mind to his wife, Judith, of whose fidelity he
entertained no suspicion, but who, having secretly fixed her affections on
another, took this opportunity of ruining her easy and credulous husband. She
conveyed intelligence of the conspiracy to the king, and aggravated every
circumstance, which, she believed, would tend to incense him against Waltheof,
and render him absolutely implacable[n70]. Meanwhile, the earl, still dubious
with regard to the part which he should act, discovered the secret in confession
to Lanfranc, on whose probity and judgment he had a great reliance: He was
persuaded by the prelate, that he owed no fidelity to those |rebellious barons,
who had by surprise gained his consent to a crime; that his first duty was to
his sovereign and benefactor, his next to himself and his family; and that, if
he seized not the opportunity of making atonement for his guilt, by revealing
it, the temerity of the conspirators was so great, that they would give some
other person the means of acquiring the merit of the discovery. Waltheof,
convinced by these arguments, went over to Normandy; but, though he was well
received by the king, and thanked for his fidelity, the account, previously
transmitted by Judith, had sunk deep into William's mind, and had destroyed all
the merit of her husband's repentance.

{#36} ^The^ conspirators, hearing of Waltheof's departure,
immediately concluded their design to be betrayed; and they flew to arms, before
their schemes were ripe for execution, and before the arrival of the Danes, in
whose aid they placed their chief confidence. The earl of Hereford was checked
by Walter de Lacy, a great baron in those parts, who, supported by the bishop of
Worcester and the abbot of Evesham, raised some forces, and prevented the earl
from passing the Severne, or advancing into the heart of the kingdom. The earl
of Norfolk was defeated at Fagadun, near Cambridge, by Odo, the regent, assisted
by Richard de Bienfaite, and William de Warrenne, the two justiciaries. The
prisoners taken in this action had their right foot cut off, as a punishment of
their treason: The earl himself escaped to Norwich, thence to Denmark; where the
Danish fleet, which had made an unsuccessful attempt upon the coast of
England[n71], soon after arrived, and brought him intelligence, that all his
confederates were suppressed and were either killed, banished, or taken
prisoners[n72]. Ralph retired in despair to Britanny, where he possessed a large
estate, and extensive jurisdictions.

{#37} ^The^ king, who hastened over to England, in order to
suppress the insurrection, found, that nothing remained but the punishment of
the criminals, which he executed with great severity. Many of the rebels were
hanged; some had their eyes put out; others their hands cut off. But William,
agreeably to his usual |maxims, showed more lenity to their leader, the earl of
Hereford, who was only condemned to a forfeiture of his estate, and to
imprisonment during pleasure. The king seemed even disposed to remit this last
part of the punishment; had not Roger, by a fresh insolence, provoked him to
render his confinement perpetual. But Waltheof, being an Englishman, was not
treated with so much humanity; #1075.# though his guilt, always
much inferior to that of the other conspirators, was atoned for by an early
repentance and return to his duty. William, instigated by his niece, as well as
by his rapacious courtiers, who longed for so rich a forfeiture, ordered him to
be tried, condemned, and executed. #29th April.# The English, who
considered this nobleman as the last resource of their nation, grievously
lamented his fate, and fancied that miracles were wrought by his reliques, as a
testimony of his innocence and sanctity. The infamous Judith, falling soon after
under the king's displeasure, was abandoned by all the world, and passed the
rest of her life in contempt, remorse, and misery.

{#38} ^Nothing^ remained to complete William's satisfaction but
the punishment of Ralph de Guader; and he hastened over to Normandy, in order to
gratify his vengeance on that criminal. But though the contest seemed very
unequal between a private nobleman and the king of England, Ralph was so well
supported both by the earl of Britanny and the King of France, that William,
after besieging him for some time in Dol, was obliged to abandon the enterprize,
and make with those powerful princes a peace, in which Ralph himself was
included. England, during his absence, remained in tranquillity; and nothing
remarkable occurred, except two ecclesiastical synods, which were summoned, one
at London, another at Winchester. In the former, the precedency among the
episcopal sees was settled, and the seat of some of them was removed from small
villages to the most considerable town within the diocese. In the second was
transacted a business of more importance.

{#39} #1076. Dispute about investitures.# ^The^
industry and perseverance are surprising, with which the popes had been
treasuring up powers and pretensions during so many ages of ignorance; while
each pontiff employed every fraud for advancing purposes of imaginary piety, and
cherished all claims which might turn to the advantage of his successors, though
he himself could not expect ever to reap any benefit from them. All |this
immense store of spiritual and civil authority was now devolved on Gregory VII.
of the name of Hildebrand, the most enterprising pontiff that had ever filled
that chair, and the least restrained by fear, decency, or moderation. Not
content with shaking off the yoke of the emperors, who had hitherto exercised
the power of appointing the pope on every vacancy, at least of ratifying his
election; he undertook the arduous task of entirely disjoining the
ecclesiastical from the civil power, and of excluding profane laymen from the
right which they had assumed, of filling the vacancies of bishoprics, abbies,
and other spiritual dignities[n73]. The sovereigns, who had long exercised this
power, and who had acquired it, not by encroachments on the church, but on the
people, to whom it originally belonged[n74], made great opposition to this claim
of the court of Rome; and Henry IV. the reigning emperor, defended this
prerogative of his crown with a vigour and resolution suitable to its
importance. The few offices, either civil or military, which the feudal
institutions left the sovereign the power of bestowing, made the prerogative of
conferring the pastoral ring and staff the most valuable jewel of the royal
diadem; especially as the general ignorance of the age bestowed a consequence on
the ecclesiastical offices, even beyond the great extent of power and property
which belonged to them. Superstition, the child of ignorance, invested the
clergy with an authority almost sacred; and as they ingrossed the little
learning of the age, their interposition became requisite in all civil business,
and a real usefulness in common life was thus superadded to the spiritual
sanctity of their character.

{#40} ^When^ the usurpations, therefore, of the church had come
to such maturity as to embolden her to attempt extorting the right of
investitures from the temporal power, Europe, especially Italy and Germany, was
thrown into the most violent convulsions, and the pope and the emperor waged
implacable war on each other. Gregory dared to fulminate the sentence of
excommunication against Henry and his adherents, to pronounce him rightfully
deposed, to free his subjects from their oaths of allegiance; and, instead of
shocking mankind by this gross encroachment on the civil authority, he found the
stupid people ready to second his most exorbitant |pretensions. Every minister,
servant, or vassal of the emperor, who received any disgust, covered his
rebellion under the pretence of principle; and even the mother of this monarch,
forgetting all the ties of nature, was seduced to countenance the insolence of
his enemies. Princes themselves, not attentive to the pernicious consequences of
those papal claims, employed them for their present purposes: And the
controversy, spreading into every city of Italy, engendered the parties of Guelf
and Ghibbelin; the most durable and most inveterate factions that ever arose
from the mixture of ambition and religious zeal. Besides numberless
assassinations, tumults, and convulsions, to which they gave rise, it is
computed that the quarrel occasioned no less than sixty battles in the reign of
Henry IV. and eighteen in that of his successor, Henry V. when the claims of the
sovereign pontiff finally prevailed[n75].

{#41} ^But^ the bold spirit of Gregory, not dismayed with the
vigorous opposition, which he met with from the emperor, extended his
usurpations all over Europe; and well knowing the nature of mankind, whose blind
astonishment ever inclines them to yield to the most impudent pretensions, he
seemed determined to set no bounds to the spiritual, or rather temporal
monarchy, which he had undertaken to erect. He pronounced the sentence of
excommunication against Nicephorus, emperor of the East; Robert Guiscard, the
adventurous Norman, who had acquired the dominion of Naples, was attacked by the
same dangerous weapon: He degraded Boleslas, king of Poland, from the rank of
king; and even deprived Poland of the title of a kingdom: He attempted to treat
Philip king of France with the same rigour, which he had employed against the
emperor[n76]: He pretended to the entire property and dominion of Spain; and he
parcelled it out amongst adventurers, who undertook to conquer it from the
Saracens, and to hold it in vassalage under the see of Rome[n77]: Even the
Christian bishops, on whose aid he relied for subduing the temporal princes, saw
that he was determined to reduce them to servitude, and by assuming the whole
legislative and judicial power of the church, to center all authority in the
sovereign pontiff[n78].

{#42} ^William^ the Conqueror, the most potent, the most
haughty, |and the most vigorous prince in Europe, was not, amidst all his
splendid successes, secure from the attacks of this enterprizing pontiff.
Gregory wrote him a letter, requiring him to fulfil his promise in doing homage
for the kingdom of England to the see of Rome, and to send him over that
tribute, which all his predecessors had been accustomed to pay to the vicar of
Christ. By the tribute, he meant Peter's pence; which, though at first a
charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was interpreted, according to the
usual practice of the Romish court, to be a badge of subjection acknowledged by
the kingdom. William replied, that the money should be remitted as usual; but
that neither had he promised to do homage to Rome, nor was it in the least his
purpose to impose that servitude on his state[n79]. And the better to show
Gregory his independance, he ventured, notwithstanding the frequent complaints
of the pope, to refuse to the English bishops the liberty of attending a general
council, which that pontiff had summoned against his enemies.

{#43} ^But^ though the king displayed this vigour in supporting
the royal dignity, he was infected with the general superstition of the age, and
he did not perceive the ambitious scope of those institutions, which, under
colour of strictness in religion, were introduced or promoted by the court of
Rome. Gregory, while he was throwing all Europe into combustion by his violence
and impostures, affected an anxious care for the purity of manners; and even the
chaste pleasures of the marriage-bed were inconsistent, in his opinion, with the
sanctity of the sacerdotal character. He had issued a decree prohibiting the
marriage of priests, excommunicating all clergymen who retained their wives,
declaring such unlawful commerce to be fornication, and rendering it criminal in
the laity to attend divine worship, when such profane priests officiated at the
altar[n80]. This point was a great object in the politics of the Roman pontiffs;
and it cost them infinitely more pains to establish it than the propagation of
any speculative absurdity, which they had ever attempted to introduce. Many
synods were summoned in different parts of Europe, before it was finally
settled; and it was there constantly remarked, that the younger clergymen
complied chearfully with the pope's decrees in this particular, |and that the
chief reluctance appeared in those who were more advanced in years: An event so
little consonant to men's natural expectations, that it could not fail to be
glossed on, even in that blind and superstitious age. William allowed the pope's
legate to assemble, in his absence, a synod at Winchester, in order to establish
the celibacy of the clergy; but the church of England could not yet be carried
the whole length expected. The synod was content with decreeing, that the
bishops should not thenceforth ordain any priests or deacons without exacting
from them a promise of celibacy; but they enacted, that none, except those who
belonged to collegiate or cathedral churches, should be obliged to separate from
their wives.

{#44} #Revolt of prince Robert.# ^The^ king
passed some years in Normandy; but his long residence there was not entirely
owing to his declared preference of that dutchy: His presence was also necessary
for composing those disturbances, which had arisen in that favourite territory,
and which had even originally proceeded from his own family. Robert, his eldest
son, sirnamed Gambaron or Courthose, from his short legs, was a prince, who
inherited all the bravery of his family and nation; but without that policy and
dissimulation, by which his father was so much distinguished, and which, no less
than his military valour, had contributed to his great successes. Greedy of
fame, impatient of contradiction, without reserve in his friendships, declared
in his enmities, this prince could endure no controul even from his imperious
father, and openly aspired to that independance, to which his temper, as well as
some circumstances in his situation, strongly invited him[n81]. When William
first received the submissions of the province of Maine, he had promised the
inhabitants, that Robert should be their prince; and before he undertook the
expedition against England, he had, on the application of the French court,
declared him his successor in Normandy, and had obliged the barons of that
dutchy to do him homage as their future sovereign. By this artifice, he had
endeavoured to appease the jealousy of his neighbours, as affording them a
prospect of separating England from his dominions on the continent; but when
Robert demanded of him the execution of those engagements, he gave him an
absolute refusal, and told him, according to |the homely saying, that he never
intended to throw off his cloaths, till he went to bed[n82]. Robert openly
declared his discontent; and was suspected of secretly instigating the king of
France and the earl of Britanny to the opposition, which they made to William,
and which had formerly frustrated his attempts upon the town of Dol. And as the
quarrel still augmented, Robert proceeded to entertain a strong jealousy of his
two surviving brothers, William and Henry, (for Richard was killed in hunting,
by a stag) who, by greater submission and complaisance, had acquired the
affections of their father. In this disposition, on both sides, the greatest
trifle sufficed to produce a rupture between them.

{#45} ^The^ three princes, residing with their father in the
castle of l'Aigle in Normandy, were one day engaged in sport together; and after
some mirth and jollity, the two younger took a fancy of throwing over some water
on Robert as he passed through the court on leaving their apartment[n83]; a
frolic, which he would naturally have regarded as innocent, had it not been for
the suggestions of Alberic de Grentmesnil, son of that Hugh de Grentmesnil, whom
William had formerly deprived of his fortunes, when that baron deserted him
during his greatest difficulties in England. The young man, mindful of the
injury, persuaded the prince, that this action was meant as a public affront,
which it behoved him in honour to resent; and the choleric Robert, drawing his
sword, ran up stairs, with an intention of taking revenge on his brothers[n84].
The whole castle was filled with tumult, which the king himself, who hastened
from his apartment, found some difficulty to appease. But he could by no means
appease the resentment of his eldest son, who, complaining of his partiality,
and fancying that no proper atonement had been made him for the insult, left the
court that very evening, and hastened to Roüen, with an intention of seizing the
citadel of that place[n85]. But being disappointed in this view by the
precaution and vigilance of Roger de Ivery, the governor, he fled to Hugh de
Neufchatel, a powerful Norman baron, who gave him protection in his castles; and
he openly levied war against his father[n86]. The popular character of the
prince, and a similarity of manners, engaged all the young nobility of Normandy
and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Britanny, to take part with him; |and it was
suspected that Matilda, his mother, whose favourite he was, supported him in his
rebellion by secret remittances of money, and by the encouragement which she
gave his partizans.

{#46} #1079.# ^All^ the hereditary provinces of
William, as well as his family, were during several years thrown into
convulsions by this war; and he was at last obliged to have recourse to England,
where that species of military government, which he had established, gave him
greater authority than the ancient feudal institutions permitted him to exercise
in Normandy. He called over an army of English under his ancient captains, who
soon expelled Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and restored the
authority of the sovereign in all his dominions. The young prince was obliged to
take shelter in the castle of Gerberoy in the Beauvoisis, which the king of
France, who secretly fomented all these dissensions, had provided for him. In
this fortress he was closely besieged by his father, against whom, having a
strong garrison, he made an obstinate defence. There passed under the walls of
this place many rencounters, which resembled more the single combats of
chivalry, than the military actions of armies; but one of them was remarkable
for its circumstances and its event. Robert happened to engage the king, who was
concealed by his helmet; and both of them being valiant, a fierce combat ensued,
till at last the young prince wounded his father in the arm, and unhorsed him.
On his calling out for assistance, his voice discovered him to his son, who,
struck with remorse for his past guilt, and astonished with the apprehensions of
one much greater, which he had so nearly incurred, instantly threw himself at
his father's feet, craved pardon for his offences, and offered to purchase
forgiveness by any atonement[n87]. The resentment, harboured by William, was so
implacable, that he did not immediately correspond to this dutiful submission of
his son with like tenderness; but giving him his malediction, departed for his
own camp, on Robert's horse, which that prince had assisted him to mount. He
soon after raised the siege, and marched with his army to Normandy; where the
interposition of the queen and other common friends brought about a
reconcilement, which was probably not a little forwarded by the generosity of
the son's behaviour in this action, and by the returning sense of his past
misconduct. |The king seemed so fully appeased, that he even took Robert with
him into England; where he intrusted him with the command of an army, in order
to repel an inroad of Malcolm king of Scotland, and to retaliate by a like
inroad into that country. The Welsh, unable to resist William's power, were,
about the same time, necessitated to pay a compensation for their incursions;
and every thing was reduced to full tranquillity on this island.

{#47} #1081. Domesday-book.# ^This^ state of
affairs gave William leisure to begin and finish an undertaking, which proves
his extensive genius, and does honour to his memory: It was a general survey of
all the lands in the kingdom, their extent in each district, their proprietors,
tenures, value; the quantity of meadow, pasture, wood, and arable land, which
they contained; and in some counties the number of tenants, cottagers, and
slaves of all denominations, who lived upon them. He appointed commissioners for
this purpose, who entered every particular in their register by the verdict of
juries; and after a labour of six years (for the work was so long in finishing)
brought him an exact account of all the landed property of his kingdom[n88].
This monument, called Domesday-book, the most valuable piece of antiquity
possessed by any nation, is still preserved in the Exchequer; and though only
some extracts of it have hitherto been published, it serves to illustrate to us
in many particulars the ancient state of England. The great Alfred had finished
a like survey of the kingdom in his time which was long kept at Winchester, and
which probably served as a model to William in this undertaking[n89].

{#48} ^The^ king was naturally a great economist; and though no
prince had ever been more bountiful to his officers and servants, it was merely
because he had rendered himself universal proprietor of England, and had a whole
kingdom to bestow. He reserved an ample revenue for the crown; and in the
general distribution of land among his followers, he kept possession of no less
than 1422 manors in different parts of Engiand[n90], which paid him rent either
in money, or in corn, cattle, and the usual produce of the soil. An |ancient
historian computes, that his annual fixed income, besides escheats, fines,
reliefs, and other casual profits to a great value, amounted to near 400,000
pounds a-year[n91]; a sum, which, if all circumstances be attended to, will
appear wholly incredible. A pound in that age, as we have already observed,
contained three times the weight of silver that it does at present; and the same
weight of silver, by the most probable computation, would purchase near ten
times more of the necessaries of life, though not in the same proportion of the
finer manufactures. This revenue, therefore, of William would be equal to at
least nine or ten millions at present; and as that prince had neither fleet nor
army to support, the former being only an occasional expence, and the latter
being maintained, without any charge to him, by his military vassals, we must
thence conclude, that no emperor or prince, in any age or nation, can be
compared to the Conqueror for opulence and riches. This leads us to suspect a
great mistake in the computation of the historian; though, if we consider that
avarice is always imputed to William as one of his vices, and that, having by
the sword rendered himself master of all the lands in the kingdom, he would
certainly in the partition retain a great proportion for his own share; we can
scarcely be guilty of any error in asserting, that perhaps no king of England
was ever more opulent, was more able to support by his revenue the splendor and
magnificence of a court, or could bestow more on his pleasures or in
liberalities to his servants and favourites[n92].

{#49} #The new forest.# ^There^ was one pleasure,
to which William, as well as all the Normans and ancient Saxons, was extremely
addicted; and that was hunting: But this pleasure he indulged more at the
expence of his unhappy subjects, whose interests he always disregarded, than to
the loss or diminution of his own revenue. Not content with those large forests,
which former kings possessed in all parts of England; he resolved to make a new
forest near Winchester, the usual place of his residence: And for that purpose,
he laid waste the country in Hampshire for an extent of thirty miles, expelled
the inhabitants from their houses, seized their property, even demolished
churches and convents, and made the sufferers no compensation |for the
injury[n93]. At the same time, he enacted new laws, by which he prohibited all
his subjects from hunting in any of his forests, and rendered the penalties more
severe than ever had been inflicted for such offences. The killing of a deer or
boar, or even a hare, was punished with the loss of the delinquent's eyes; and
that at a time, when the killing of a man could be atoned for by paying a
moderate fine or composition.

{#50} ^The^ transactions, recorded during the remainder of this
reign, may be considered more as domestic occurrences, which concern the prince,
than as national events, which regard England. Odo, bishop of Baieux, the king's
uterine brother, whom he had created earl of Kent, and entrusted with a great
share of power during his whole reign, had amassed immense riches; and agreeably
to the usual progress of human wishes, he began to regard his present
acquisitions but as a step to farther grandeur. He had formed the chimerical
project of buying the papacy; and though Gregory, the reigning pope, was not of
advanced years, the prelate had confided so much in the predictions of an
astrologer, that he reckoned upon the pontiff's death, and upon attaining, by
his own intrigues and money, that envied state of greatness. Resolving,
therefore, to remit all his riches to Italy, he had persuaded many considerable
barons, and among the rest, Hugh earl of Chester, to take the same course; in
hopes, that when he should mount the papal throne, he would bestow on them more
considerable establishments in that country. The king, from whom all these
projects had been carefully concealed, #1082.# at last got
intelligence of the design, and ordered Odo to be arrested. His officers, from
respect to the immunities, which the ecclesiastics now assumed, scrupled to
execute the command, till the king himself was obliged in person to seize him;
and when Odo insisted that he was a prelate, and exempt from all temporal
jurisdiction, William replied, that he arrested him, not as bishop of Baieux,
but as earl of Kent. He was sent prisoner to Normandy; and notwithstanding the
remonstrances and menaces of Gregory, was detained in custody during the
remainder of this reign.

{#51} #1083.# ^Another^ domestic event gave the
king much more concern: It was the death of Matilda, his consort, whom he
tenderly |loved, and for whom he had ever preserved the most sincere friendship.
Three years afterwards he passed into Normandy, and carried with him Edgar
Atheling, to whom he willingly granted permission to make a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land. He was detained on the continent by a misunderstanding, #1087.
War with France.# which broke out between him and the king of France,
and which was occasioned by inroads made into Normandy by some French barons on
the frontiers. It was little in the power of princes at that time to restrain
their licentious nobility; but William suspected, that these barons durst not
have provoked his indignation, had they not been assured of the countenance and
protection of Philip. His displeasure was encreased by the account he received
of some railleries which that monarch had thrown out against him. William, who
was become corpulent, had been detained in bed some time by sickness; upon which
Philip expressed his surprise that his brother of England should be so long in
being delivered of his big belly. The king sent him word, that, as soon as he
was up, he would present so many lights at Notre-dame, as would perhaps give
little pleasure to the king of France; alluding to the usual practice at that
time of women after child-birth. Immediately on his recovery, he led an army
into L'Isle de France, and laid every thing waste with fire and sword. He took
the town of Mante, which he reduced to ashes. But the progress of these
hostilities was stopped by an accident, which soon after put an end to William's
life. His horse starting aside of a sudden, he bruised his belly on the pommel
of the saddle; and being in a bad habit of body, as well as somewhat advanced in
years, he began to apprehend the consequences, and ordered himself to be carried
in a litter to the monastery of St. Gervas. Finding his illness encrease, and
being sensible of the approach of death, he discovered at last the vanity of all
human grandeur, and was struck with remorse for those horrible cruelties and
acts of violence, which, in the attainment and defence of it, he had committed
during the course of his reign over England. He endeavoured to make atonement by
presents to churches and monasteries; and he issued orders, that earl Morcar,
Siward Bearne, and other English prisoners, should be set at liberty. He was
even prevailed on, though not without reluctance, to consent, with his dying
breath, to release his brother, Odo, against whom he was extremely incensed. He
left Normandy and Maine to his eldest son, Robert: He wrote to Lanfranc,
desiring him to crown William |king of England: He bequeathed to Henry nothing
but the possessions of his mother, Matilda; but foretold, that he would one day
surpass both his brothers in power and opulence. He expired in the sixty-third
year of his age, #9th Sept. Death and character of William the
Conqueror.# in the twenty-first year of his reign over England, and in
the fifty-fourth of that over Normandy.

{#52} ^Few^ princes have been more fortunate than this great
monarch, or were better entitled to grandeur and prosperity, from the abilities
and the vigour of mind which he displayed in all his conduct. His spirit was
bold and enterprising, yet guided by prudence: His ambition, which was
exorbitant, and lay little under the restraints of justice, still less under
those of humanity, ever submitted to the dictates of sound policy. Born in an
age when the minds of men were intractable and unacquainted with submission, he
was yet able to direct them to his purposes; and partly from the ascendant of
his vehement character, partly from art and dissimulation, to establish an
unlimited authority. Though not insensible to generosity, he was hardened
against compassion; and he seemed equally ostentatious and equally ambitious of
show and parade in his clemency and in his severity. The maxims of his
administration were austere; but might have been useful, had they been solely
employed to preserve order in an established government[n94]: They were ill
calculated for softening the rigours, which, under the most gentle management,
are inseparable from conquest. His attempt against England was the last great
enterprize of the kind, which, during the course of seven hundred years, has
fully succeeded in Europe; and the force of his genius broke through those
limits, which first the feudal institutions, then the refined policy of princes,
have fixed to the several states of Christendom. Though he rendered himself
infinitely odious to his English subjects, he transmitted his power to his
posterity, and the throne is still filled by his descendants: A proof, that the
foundations which he laid were firm and solid, and that, amidst all his
violence, while he seemed only to gratify the present passion, he had still an
eye towards futurity.

{#53} ^Some^ writers have been desirous of refusing to this
prince the title of Conqueror, in the sense which that term commonly bears; and
on pretence, that the word is sometimes in old books applied to such as make an
acquisition of territory by any means, they are |willing to reject William's
title, by right of war, to the crown of England. It is needless to enter into a
controversy, which, by the terms of it, must necessarily degenerate into a
dispute of words. It suffices to say, that the duke of Normandy's first invasion
of the island was hostile; that his subsequent administration was entirely
supported by arms, that in the very frame of his laws he made a distinction
between the Normans and English, to the advantage of the former[n95]; that he
acted in every thing as absolute master over the natives, whose interests and
affections he totally disregarded; and that if there was an interval when he
assumed the appearance of a legal sovereign, the period was very short, and was
nothing but a temporary sacrifice, which he, as has been the case with most
conquerors, was obliged to make, of his inclination to his present policy.
Scarce any of those revolutions, which, both in history and in common language,
have always been denominated conquests, appear equally violent, or were attended
with so sudden an alteration both of power and property. The Roman state, which
spread its dominion over Europe, left the rights of individuals, in a great
measure, untouched; and those civilized conquerors, while they made their own
country the seat of empire, found, that they could draw most advantage from the
subjected provinces, by securing to the natives the free enjoyment of their own
laws and of their private possessions. The barbarians, who subdued the Roman
empire, though they settled in the conquered countries, yet being accustomed to
a rude uncultivated life, found a part only of the land sufficient to supply all
their wants; and they were not tempted to seize extensive possessions, which
they knew neither how to cultivate nor enjoy. But the Normans and other
foreigners, who followed the standard of William, while they made the vanquished
kingdom the seat of government, were yet so far advanced in arts as to be
acquainted with the advantages of a large property; and having totally subdued
the natives, they pushed the rights of conquest (very extensive in the eyes of
avarice and ambition, however narrow in those of reason) to the utmost extremity
against them. Except the former conquest of England by the Saxons themselves,
who were induced, by peculiar circumstances, to proceed even to the
extermination of the natives, it would be difficult to find in all |history a
revolution more destructive, or attended with a more complete subjection of the
antient inhabitants. Contumely seems even to have been wantonly added to
oppression[n96]; and the natives were universally reduced to such a state of
meanness and poverty, that the English name became a term of reproach; and
several generations elapsed before one family of Saxon pedigree was raised to
any considerable honours, or could so much as attain the rank of baron of the
realm[n97]. These facts are so apparent from the whole tenor of the English
history, that none would have been tempted to deny or elude them, were they not
heated by the controversies of faction; while one party was _absurdly_ afraid of
those _absurd_ consequences, which they saw the other party inclined to draw
from this event. But it is evident, that the present rights and privileges of
the people, who are a mixture of English and Normans, can never be affected by a
transaction, which passed seven hundred years ago; and as all ancient
authors[n98], who lived nearest the time, and best knew the state of the
country, unanimously speak of the Norman dominion as a conquest by war and arms,
no reasonable man, from the fear of imaginary consequences, will ever be tempted
to reject their concurring and undoubted testimony.

{#54} ^King^ William had issue, besides his three sons, who
survived him, five daughters, to wit, (1.) Cicily, a nun in the monastery of
Feschamp, afterwards abbess in the holy Trinity at Caen, where she died in 1127.
(2.) Constantia, married to Alan Fergant, earl of Britanny. She died without
issue. (3.) Alice, contracted to Harold. (4.) Adela, married to Stephen, earl of

{#n49} The obliging of all the inhabitants to put out their
fires and lights at certain hours, upon the sounding of a bell, called the
_courfeu,_ is represented by Polydore Virgil, lib. 9. as a mark of the servitude
of the English. But this was a law of police, which William had previously
established in Normandy. See du Moulin, hist. de Normandie, p. 160. The same law
had place in Scotland. LL. Burgor, cap. 86.

{#n56} Brompton relates, that Wulstan was also deprived by the
synod; but refusing to deliver his pastoral staff and ring to any but the person
from whom he first received it, he went immediately to king Edward's tomb, and
struck the staff so deeply into the stone, that none but himself was able to
pull it out: Upon which he was allowed to keep his bishopric. This instance may
serve, instead of many, as a specimen of the monkish miracles. See also the
Annals of Burton, p. 284.

{#n66} What these laws were of Edward the Confessor, which the
English, every reign during a century and a half, desire so passionately to have
restored, is much disputed by antiquaries, and our ignorance of them seems one
of the greatest defects in the ancient English history. The collection of laws
in Wilkins, which pass under the name of Edward, are plainly a posterior and an
ignorant compilation. Those to be found in Ingulf are genuine; but so imperfect,
and contain so few clauses favourable to the subject, that we see no great
reason for their contending for them so vehemently. It is probable, that the
English meant the _common law,_ as it prevailed during the reign of Edward;
which we may conjecture to have been more indulgent to liberty than the Norman
institutions. The most material articles of it were afterwards comprehended in
Magna Charta.

present in that country.

Willielmus, quid in principes Anglorum, qui tantae cladi superesse poterant,
fecerit, dicere, cum nihil prosit, omitto. Quid enim prodesset, si nec unum in
toto regno de illis dicerem pristina potestate uti permissum, sed omnes aut in
gravem paupertatis aerumnam detrusos, aut exhaeredatos, patria pulsos, aut
effossis oculis, vel caeteris amputatis membris, opprobrium hominum factos, aut
certe miserrime afflictos, vita privatos. Simili modo utilitate carere existimo
dicere quid in minorem populum, non solum ab eo, sed a suis actum sit, cum id
dictu sciamus difficile, et ob immanem crudelitatem fortassis incredibile._
