{#1} #1172. State of Ireland.# AS Britain was first peopled from Gaul, so was
Ireland probably from Britain; and the inhabitants of all these countries seem
to have been so many tribes of the Celtae, who derive their origin from an
antiquity, that lies far beyond the records of any history or tradition. The
Irish, from the beginning of time, had been buried in the most profound
barbarism and ignorance; and as they were never conquered or even invaded by the
Romans, from whom all the western world derived its civility, they continued
still in the most rude state of society, and were distinguished by those vices
alone, to which human nature, not tamed by education or restrained by laws, is
for ever subject. The small principalities, into which they were divided,
exercised perpetual rapine and violence against each other; the uncertain
succession of their princes was a continual source of domestic convulsions; the
usual |title of each petty sovereign was the murder of his predecessor; courage
and force, though exercised in the commission of crimes, were more honoured than
any pacific virtues; and the most simple arts of life, even tillage and
agriculture, were almost wholly unknown among them. They had felt the invasions
of the Danes and the other northern tribes; but these inroads, which had spread
barbarism in other parts of Europe, tended rather to improve the Irish; and the
only towns, which were to be found in the island, had been planted along the
coast by the freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other inhabitants exercised
pasturage in the open country; sought protection from any danger in their
forests and morasses; and being divided by the fiercest animosities against each
other, were still more intent on the means of mutual injury, than on the
expedients for common or even for private interest.

{#2} ^Besides^ many small tribes, there were in the age of Henry II. five
principal sovereignties in the island, Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster, and
Connaught; and as it had been usual for the one or the other of these to take
the lead in their wars, there was commonly some prince, who seemed, for the
time, to act as monarch of Ireland. Roderic O Connor, king of Connaught, was
then advanced to this dignity[n1]; but his government, ill obeyed even within
his own territory, could not unite the people in any measures, either for the
establishment of order, or for defence against foreigners. The ambition of Henry
had, very early in his reign, been moved, by the prospect of these advantages,
to attempt the subjecting of Ireland; and a pretence was only wanting to invade
a people, who, being always confined to their own island, had never given any
reason of complaint to any of their neighbours. For this purpose, he had
recourse to Rome, which assumed a right to dispose of kingdoms and empires; and
not foreseeing the dangerous disputes, which he was one day to maintain with
that see, he helped, for present, or rather for an imaginary, convenience, to
give sanction to claims which were now become dangerous to all sovereigns.
Adrian IV. who then filled the papal chair, was by birth an Englishman; and
being, on that account, the more disposed to oblige Henry, he was easily
persuaded to act as master of the world, and to make, without any hazard or
expence, the acquisition |of a great island to his spiritual jurisdiction. The
Irish had, by precedent missions from the Britons, been imperfectly converted to
Christianity; and, what the pope regarded as the surest mark of their imperfect
conversion, they followed the doctrines of their first teachers, and had never
acknowledged any subjection to the see of Rome. Adrian, therefore, in the year
1156, issued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after premising, that this
prince had ever shown an anxious care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and
to encrease the number of his saints and elect in heaven; he represents his
design of subduing Ireland as derived from the same pious motives: He considers
his care of previously applying for the apostolic sanction as a sure earnest of
success and victory; and having established it as a point incontestible, that
all Christian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it
to be his own duty to sow among them the seeds of the gospel, which might in the
last day fructify to their eternal salvation: He exhorts the king to invade
Ireland, in order to extirpate the vice and wickedness of the natives, and
oblige them to pay yearly, from every house, a penny to the see of Rome: He
gives him entire right and authority over the island, commands all the
inhabitants to obey him as their sovereign, and invests with full power all such
godly instruments as he should think proper to employ in an enterprize, thus
calculated for the glory of God and the salvation of the souls of men[n2].
Henry, though armed with this authority, did not immediately put his design in
execution; but being detained by more interesting business on the continent,
waited for a favourable opportunity of invading Ireland.

{#3} ^Dermot^ Macmorrogh, king of Leinster, had, by his licentious tyranny,
rendered himself odious to his subjects, who seized with alacrity the first
occasion that offered, of throwing off the yoke, which was become grievous and
oppressive to them. This prince had formed a design on Dovergilda, wife of
Ororic, prince of Breffny; and taking advantage of her husband's absence, who,
being obliged to visit a distant part of his territory, had left his wife
secure, as he thought, in an island, surrounded by a bog, he suddenly invaded
the place, and carried off the princess[n3]. This exploit, |though usual among
the Irish, and rather deemed a proof of gallantry and spirit[n4], provoked the
resentment of the husband; who, having collected forces, and being strengthened
by the alliance of Roderic, king of Connaught, invaded the dominions of Dermot,
and expelled him his kingdom. The exiled prince had recourse to Henry, who was
at this time in Guienne, craved his assistance in restoring him to his
sovereignty, and offered, on that event, to hold his kingdom in vassalage under
the crown of England. Henry, whose views were already turned towards making
acquisitions in Ireland, readily accepted the offer; but being at that time
embarrassed by the rebellions of his French subjects, as well as by his disputes
with the see of Rome, he declined, for the present, embarking in the enterprize,
and gave Dermot no farther assistance than letters patent, by which he empowered
all his subjects to aid the Irish prince in the recovery of his dominions[n5].
Dermot supported by this authority, came to Bristol; and after endeavouring,
though for some time in vain, to engage adventurers in the enterprize, he at
last formed a treaty with Richard, sirnamed Strongbow, earl of Strigul. This
nobleman, who was of the illustrious house of Clare, had impaired his fortune by
expensive pleasures; and being ready for any desperate undertaking, he promised
assistance to Dermot, on condition that he should espouse Eva, daughter of that
prince, and be declared heir to all his dominions[n6]. While Richard was
assembling his succours, Dermot went into Wales; and meeting with Robert
Fitz-Stephens, constable of Abertivi, and Maurice Fitz-Gerald, he also engaged
them in his service, and obtained their promise of invading Ireland. Being now
assured of succour, he returned privately to his own state; and lurking in the
monastery of Fernes, which he had founded, (for this ruffian was also a founder
of monasteries) he prepared every thing for the reception of his English
allies[n7].

{#4} #Conquest of that island.# ^The^ troops of Fitz-Stephens were first ready.
That gentleman landed in Ireland with thirty knights, sixty esquires, and three
hundred archers; but this small body, being brave men, not unacquainted with
discipline, and completely armed, a thing almost unknown in Ireland, struck a
great terror into the barbarous inhabitants, |and seemed to menace them with
some signal revolution. The conjunction of Maurice de Pendergail, who, about the
same time, brought over ten knights and sixty archers, enabled Fitz-Stephens to
attempt the siege of Wexford, a town inhabited by the Danes; and after gaining
an advantage, he made himself master of the place[n8]. Soon after, Fitz-Gerald
arrived with ten knights, thirty esquires, and a hundred archers[n9]; and being
joined by the former adventurers, composed a force which nothing in Ireland was
able to withstand. Roderic, the chief monarch of the island, was foiled in
different actions; the prince of Ossory was obliged to submit, and give hostages
for his peaceable behaviour; and Dermot, not content with being restored to his
kingdom of Leinster, projected the dethroning of Roderic, and aspired to the
sole dominion over the Irish.

{#5} ^In^ prosecution of these views, he sent over a messenger to the earl of
Strigul, challenging the performance of his promise, and displaying the mighty
advantages which might now be reaped by a reinforcement of warlike troops from
England. Richard, not satisfied with the general allowance given by Henry to all
his subjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and having obtained a cold
or ambiguous permission, prepared himself for the execution of his designs. He
first sent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and seventy
archers, who, landing near Waterford, defeated a body of three thousand Irish,
that had ventured to attack him[n10]; and as Richard himself, who brought over
two hundred horse, and a body of archers, joined, a few days after, the
victorious English, they made themselves masters of Waterford, and proceeded to
Dublin, which was taken by assault. Roderic, in revenge, cut off the head of
Dermot's natural son, who had been left as a hostage in his hands; and Richard,
marrying Eva, became soon after, by the death of Dermot, master of the kingdom
of Leinster, and prepared to extend his authority over all Ireland. Roderic, and
the other Irish princes, were alarmed at the danger; and combining together,
besieged Dublin with an army of thirty thousand men: But earl Richard, making a
sudden sally at the head of ninety knights, with their followers, put this
numerous army to rout, chaced them off the field, and pursued them with |great
slaughter. None in Ireland now dared to oppose themselves to the English[n11].

{#6} ^Henry^, jealous of the progress, made by his own subjects, sent orders to
recal all the English, and he made preparations to attack Ireland in
person[n12]: But Richard, and the other adventurers, found means to appease him,
by making him the most humble submissions, and offering to hold all their
acquisitions in vassalage to his crown[n13]. That monarch landed in Ireland at
the head of five hundred knights, besides other soldiers: He found the Irish so
dispirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a progress which he made through
the island, he had no other occupation than to receive the homages of his new
subjects. He left most of the Irish chieftains or princes in possession of their
ancient territories; bestowed some lands on the English adventurers; gave earl
Richard the commission of seneschal of Ireland; and after a stay of a few
months, returned in triumph to England. By these trivial exploits, scarcely
worth relating, except for the importance of the consequences, was Ireland
subdued, and annexed to the English crown.

{#7} ^The^ low state of commerce and industry, during those ages, made it
impracticable for princes to support regular armies, which might retain a
conquered country in subjection; and the extreme barbarism and poverty of
Ireland could still less afford means of bearing the expence. The only
expedient, by which a durable conquest could then be made or maintained, was by
pouring in a multitude of new inhabitants, dividing among them the lands of the
vanquished, establishing them in all offices of trust and authority, and thereby
transforming the ancient inhabitants into a new people. By this policy, the
northern invaders of old, and of late the duke of Normandy, had been able to fix
their dominions, and to erect kingdoms, which remained stable on their
foundations, and were transmitted to the posterity of the first conquerors. But
the state of Ireland rendered that island so little inviting to the English,
that only a few of desperate fortunes could be persuaded, from time to time, to
transport themselves thither[n14]; and instead of reclaiming the natives from
their uncultivated manners, they were |gradually assimilated to the antient
inhabitants, and degenerated from the customs of their own nation. It was also
found requisite to bestow great military and arbitrary powers on the leaders,
who commanded a handful of men amidst such hostile multitudes; and law and
equity, in a little time, became as much unknown in the English settlements as
they had ever been among the Irish tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of
the new adventurers; independant authority conferred; the natives, never fully
subdued, still retained their animosity against the conquerors; their hatred was
retaliated by like injuries; and from these causes, the Irish, during the course
of four centuries, remained still savage and untractable: It was not till the
latter end of Elizabeth's reign, that the island was fully subdued; nor till
that of her successor, that it gave hopes of becoming a useful conquest to the
English nation.

{#8} ^Besides^ that the easy and peaceable submission of the Irish left Henry no
farther occupation in that island, he was recalled from it by another incident,
which was of the last importance to his interest and safety. The two legates,
Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed the trial of his conduct in the murder
of archbishop Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and being impatient of delay,
sent him frequent letters, full of menaces, if he protracted any longer making
his appearance before them[n15]. He hastened therefore to Normandy, and had a
conference with them at Savigny, where their demands were so exorbitant, that he
broke off the negotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade them do
their worst against him. They perceived that the season was now past for taking
advantage of that tragical incident; which, had it been hotly pursued by
interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into
combustion. But the time, which Henry had happily gained, had contributed to
appease the minds of men: The event could not now have the same influence, as
when it was recent; and as the clergy every day looked for an accommodation with
the king, they had not opposed the pretensions of his partizans, who had been
very industrious in representing to the people his entire innocence in the
murder of the primate, and his ignorance of the designs formed by the assassins.
The legates, therefore, found themselves obliged to lower their |terms; and
Henry was so fortunate as to conclude an accommodation with them. He declared
upon oath, before the reliques of the saints, that, so far from commanding or
desiring the death of the archbishop, he was extremely grieved when he received
intelligence of it: But as the passion, which he had expressed on account of
that prelate's conduct, had probably been the occasion of his murder, he
stipulated the following conditions, as an atonement for the offence. #The
king's accommodation withe the court of Rome.# He promised, that he should
pardon all such as had been banished for adhering to Becket, and should restore
them to their livings; that the see of Canterbury should be reinstated in all
its antient possessions; that he should pay the templars a sum of money
sufficient for the subsistance of two hundred knights during a year in the Holy
Land; that he should himself take the cross at the Christmas following, and, if
the pope required it, serve three years against the infidels, either in Spain or
Palestine; that he should not insist on the observance of such customs,
derogatory to ecclesiastical privileges, as had been introduced in his own time;
and that he should not obstruct appeals to the pope in ecclesiastical causes,
but should content himself with exacting sufficient security from such clergymen
as left his dominions to prosecute an appeal, that they should attempt nothing
against the rights of his crown[n16]. Upon signing these concessions, Henry
received absolution from the legates, and was confirmed in the grant of Ireland
made by pope Adrian[n17]: and nothing proves more strongly the great abilities
of this monarch, than his extricating himself, on such easy terms, from so
difficult a situation. He had always insisted, that the laws, established at
Clarendon, contained not any new claims, but the ancient customs of the kingdom;
and he was still at liberty, notwithstanding the articles of this agreement, to
maintain his pretensions. Appeals to the pope were indeed permitted by that
treaty; but as the king was also permitted to exact reasonable securities from
the parties, and might stretch his demands on this head as far as he pleased, he
had it virtually in his power to prevent the pope from reaping any advantage by
this seeming concession. And on the whole, the constitutions of Clarendon
remained still the law of the realm; though |the pope and his legates seem so
little to have conceived the king's power to lie under any legal limitations,
that they were satisfied with his departing, by treaty, from one of the most
momentous articles of these constitutions, without requiring any repeal by the
states of the kingdom.

{#9} ^Henry^, freed from this dangerous controversy with the ecclesiastics and
with the see of Rome, seemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur
and felicity, and to be equally happy in his domestic situation and in his
political government. A numerous progeny of sons and daughters gave both lustre
and authority to his crown, prevented the dangers of a disputed succession, and
repressed all pretensions of the ambitious barons. The king's precaution also,
in establishing the several branches of his family, seemed well calculated to
prevent all jealousy among the brothers, and to perpetuate the greatness of his
family. He had appointed Henry, his eldest son, to be his successor in the
kingdom of England, the dutchy of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine,
and Touraine; territories which lay contiguous, and which, by that means, might
easily lend to each other mutual assistance, both against intestine commotions
and foreign invasions. Richard, his second son, was invested in the dutchy of
Guienne and county of Poictou; Geoffrey, his third son, inherited, in right of
his wife, the dutchy of Britanny; and the new conquest of Ireland was destined
for the appanage of John, his fourth son. He had also negociated, in favour of
this last prince, a marriage with Adelais, the only daughter of Humbert, count
of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive as her dowry considerable demesnes in
Piedmont, Savoy, Bresse, and Dauphiny[n18]. But this exaltation of his family
excited the jealousy of all his neighbours, who made those very sons, whose
fortunes he had so anxiously established, the means of embittering his future
life and disturbing his government.

{#10} ^Young^ Henry, who was rising to man's estate, began to display his
character, and aspire to independance: Brave, ambitious, liberal, munificent,
affable; he discovered qualities, which give great lustre to youth;
prognosticate a shining fortune; but, unless tempered |in mature age with
discretion, are the forerunners of the greatest calamities[n19]. It is said,
that at the time when this prince received the royal unction, his father, in
order to give greater dignity to the ceremony, officiated at table as one of the
retinue; and observed to his son, that never king was more royally served. _It
is nothing extraordinary,_ said young Henry to one of his courtiers, _if the son
of a count should serve the son of a king._ This saying, which might pass only
for an innocent pleasantry, or even for an oblique compliment to his father, was
however regarded as a symptom of his aspiring temper; and his conduct soon after
justified the conjecture.

{#11} ^Henry^, agreeably to the promise which he had given both to the pope and
French king, permitted his son to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbishop
of Roüen, #1173.# and associated the princess Margaret, spouse to young Henry,
in the ceremony[n20]. He afterwards allowed him to pay a visit to his
father-in-law at Paris, who took the opportunity of instilling into the young
prince those ambitious sentiments, to which he was naturally but too much
inclined[n21]. Though it had been the constant practice of France, #Revolt of
young Henry and his brothers.# ever since the accession of the Capetian line, to
crown the son during the life-time of the father, without conferring on him any
present participation of royalty; Lewis persuaded his son-in-law, that, by this
ceremony, which in those ages was deemed so important, he had acquired a title
to sovereignty, and that the king could not, without injustice, exclude him from
immediate possession of the whole, or at least a part of his dominions. In
consequence of these extravagant ideas, young Henry, on his return, desired the
king to resign to him either the crown of England or the dutchy of Normandy;
discovered great discontent on the refusal; spake in the most undutiful terms of
his father; and soon after, in concert with Lewis, made his escape to Paris,
where he was protected and supported by that monarch.

{#12} ^While^ Henry was alarmed at this incident, and had the prospect |of
dangerous intrigues, or even of a war, which, whether successful or not, must be
extremely calamitous and disagreeable to him, he received intelligence of new
misfortunes, which must have affected him in the most sensible manner. Queen
Eleanor, who had disgusted her first husband by her gallantries, was no less
offensive to her second, by her jealousy; and after this manner, carried to
extremity, in the different periods of her life, every circumstance of female
weakness. She communicated her discontents against Henry to her two younger
sons, Geoffrey and Richard, persuaded them that they were also entitled to
present possession of the territories assigned to them; engaged them to fly
secretly to the court of France; and was meditating, herself, an escape to the
same court, and had even put on man's apparel for that purpose; when she was
seized by orders from her husband, and thrown into confinement. Thus, Europe saw
with astonishment the best and most indulgent of parents at war with his whole
family; three boys, scarcely arrived at the age of puberty, require a great
monarch, in the full vigour of his age and height of his reputation, to dethrone
himself in their favour; and several princes not ashamed to support them in
these unnatural and absurd pretensions.

{#13} ^Henry^, reduced to this perilous and disagreeable situation, had recourse
to the court of Rome: Though sensible of the danger attending the interposition
of ecclesiastical authority in temporal disputes, he applied to the pope, as his
superior lord, to excommunicate his enemies, and by these censures to reduce to
obedience his undutiful children, whom he found such reluctance to punish by the
sword of the magistrate[n22]. Alexander, well pleased to exert his power in so
justifiable a cause, issued the bulls required of him: But it was soon found,
that these spiritual weapons had not the same force as when employed in a
spiritual controversy; and that the clergy were very negligent in supporting a
sentence, which was nowise calculated to promote the immediate interests of
their order. The king, after taking in vain this humiliating step, was obliged
to have recourse to arms, and to enlist such auxiliaries, as |are the usual
resource of tyrants, and have seldom been employed by so wise and just a
monarch.

{#14} ^The^ loose government which prevailed in all the states of Europe, the
many private wars carried on among the neighbouring nobles, and the
impossibility of enforcing any general execution of the laws, had encouraged a
tribe of banditti to disturb every where the public peace, to infest the
highways, to pillage the open country, and to brave all the efforts of the civil
magistrate, and even the excommunications of the church, which were fulminated
against them[n23]. Troops of them were sometimes inlisted in the service of one
prince or baron, sometimes in that of another: They often acted in an
independant manner, under leaders of their own: The peaceable and industrious
inhabitants, reduced to poverty by their ravages, were frequently obliged for
subsistence to betake themselves to a like disorderly course of life: And a
continual intestine war, pernicious to industry, as well as to the execution of
justice, was thus carried on in the bowels of every kingdom[n24]. Those
desperate ruffians received the name sometimes of Brabançons, sometimes of
Routiers or Cottereaux; but for what reason, is not agreed by historians: And
they formed a kind of society or government among themselves, which set at
defiance the rest of mankind. The greatest monarchs were not ashamed, on
occasion, to have recourse to their assistance; and as their habits of war and
depredation had given them experience, hardiness, and courage, they generally
composed the most formidable part of those armies, which decided the political
quarrels of princes. Several of them were enlisted among the forces levied by
Henry's enemies[n25]; but the great treasures amassed by that prince enabled him
to engage more numerous troops of them in his service; and the situation of his
affairs rendered even such banditti the only forces on whose fidelity he could
repose any confidence. His licentious barons, disgusted with a vigilant
government, were more desirous of being ruled by young princes, ignorant of
public affairs, remiss in their conduct, and profuse in their grants[n26]; and
as the king had ensured to his sons the succession to every particular province
of his dominions, the nobles dreaded no danger in adhering to those who, they
|knew, must some time become their sovereigns. Prompted by these motives, many
of the Norman nobility had deserted to his son Henry; the Breton and Gascon
barons seemed equally disposed to embrace the quarrel of Geoffrey and Richard.
Disaffection had creeped in among the English; and the earls of Leicester and
Chester in particular had openly declared against the king. Twenty thousand
Brabançons, therefore, joined to some troops, which he brought over from
Ireland, and a few barons of approved fidelity, formed the sole force, with
which he intended to resist his enemies.

{#15} ^Lewis^, in order to bind the confederates in a closer union, summoned at
Paris an assembly of the chief vassals of the crown, received their approbation
of his measures, and engaged them by oath to adhere to the cause of young Henry.
This prince, in return, bound himself by a like tie never to desert his French
allies; and having made a new great seal, he lavishly distributed among them
many considerable parts of those territories, which he purposed to conquer from
his father. The counts of Flanders, Boulogne, Blois, and Eu, partly moved by the
general jealousy arising from Henry's power and ambition, partly allured by the
prospect of reaping advantage from the inconsiderate temper and the necessities
of the young prince, declared openly in favour of the latter. William, king of
Scotland, had also entered into this great confederacy; and a plan was concerted
for a general invasion on different parts of the king's extensive and factious
dominions.

{#16} ^Hostilities^ were first commenced by the counts of Flanders and Boulogne
on the frontiers of Normandy. Those princes laid siege to Aumale, which was
delivered into their hands, by the treachery of the count of that name: This
nobleman surrendered himself prisoner; and, on pretence of thereby paying his
ransom, opened the gates of all his other fortresses. The two counts next
besieged and made themselves masters of Drincourt: But the count of Boulogne was
here mortally wounded in the assault; and this incident put some stop to the
progress of the Flemish arms.

{#17} #Wars and insurrections.# ^In^ another quarter, the king of France, being
strongly assisted by his vassals, assembled a great army of seven thousand
knights and their followers on horseback, and a proportionable number of
infantry: Carrying young Henry along with him, he laid siege to Verneüil, which
was vigorously defended by Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de Beauchamp, the governors.
After he had lain a month |before the place, the garrison, being straitened for
provisions, were obliged to capitulate; and they engaged, if not relieved within
three days, to surrender the town, and to retire into the citadel. On the last
of these days, Henry appeared with his army upon the heights above Verneüil.
Lewis, dreading an attack, sent the archbishop of Sens and the count of Blois to
the English camp, and desired that next day should be appointed for a
conference, in order to establish a general peace, and terminate the difference
between Henry and his sons. The king, who passionately desired this
accommodation, and suspected no fraud, gave his consent; but Lewis, that
morning, obliging the garrison to surrender, according to the capitulation, set
fire to the place, and began to retire with his army. Henry, provoked at this
artifice, attacked the rear with vigour, put them to rout, did some execution,
and took several prisoners. The French army, as their time of service was now
expired, immediately dispersed themselves into their several provinces; and left
Henry free to prosecute his advantages against his other enemies.

{#18} ^The^ nobles of Britanny, instigated by the earl of Chester and Ralph de
Fougeres, were all in arms; but their progress was checked by a body of
Brabançons, which the king, after Lewis's retreat, had sent against them. The
two armies came to an action near Dol; where the rebels were defeated, fifteen
hundred killed on the spot, and the leaders, the earls of Chester and Fougeres,
obliged to take shelter in the town of Dol. Henry hastened to form the siege of
that place, and carried on the attack with such ardour, that he obliged the
governor and garrison to surrender themselves prisoners. By these vigorous
measures and happy successes, the insurrections were entirely quelled in
Britanny; and the king, thus fortunate in all quarters, willingly agreed to a
conference with Lewis, in hopes, that his enemies, finding all their mighty
efforts entirely frustrated, would terminate hostilities on some moderate and
reasonable conditions.

{#19} ^The^ two monarchs met between Trie and Gisors; and Henry had here the
mortification to see his three sons in the retinue of his mortal enemy. As Lewis
had no other pretence for war than supporting the claims of the young princes,
the king made them such offers as children might be ashamed to insist on, and
could be extorted from him by nothing but his parental affection or by the
|present necessity of his affairs[n27]. He insisted only on retaining the
sovereign authority in all his dominions; but offered young Henry half the
revenues of England, with some places of surety in that kingdom; or, if he
rather chose to reside in Normandy, half the revenues of that dutchy, with all
those of Anjou. He made a like offer to Richard in Guienne; he promised to
resign Britanny to Geoffrey; and if these concessions were not deemed
sufficient, he agreed to add to them whatever the pope's legates, who were
present, should require of him[n28]. The earl of Leicester was also present at
the negotiation; and either from the impetuosity of his temper, or from a view
of abruptly breaking off a conference which must cover the allies with
confusion, he gave vent to the most violent reproaches against Henry, and he
even put his hand to his sword, as if he meant to attempt some violence against
him. This furious action threw the whole company into confusion, and put an end
to the treaty[n29].

{#20} ^The^ chief hopes of Henry's enemies seemed now to depend on the state of
affairs in England, where his authority was exposed to the most imminent danger.
One article of prince Henry's agreement with his foreign confederates, was, that
he should resign Kent, with Dover and all its other fortresses, into the hands
of the earl of Flanders[n30]: Yet so little national or public spirit prevailed
among the independant English nobility, so wholly bent were they on the
aggrandizement each of himself and his own family, that, notwithstanding this
pernicious concession, which must have produced the ruin of the kingdom, the
greater part of them had conspired to make an insurrection and to support the
prince's pretensions. The king's principal resource lay in the church and the
bishops, with whom he was now in perfect agreement; whether that the decency of
their character made them ashamed of supporting so unnatural a rebellion, or
that they were entirely satisfied with Henry's atonement for the murder of
Becket and for his former invasion of ecclesiastical immunities. That prince,
however, had resigned none of the essential rights of his crown in the
accommodation; he maintained still the same prudent jealousy of the court of
Rome; admitted no legate into England, without his |swearing to attempt nothing
against the royal prerogatives; and he had even obliged the monks of Canterbury,
who pretended to a free election on the vacancy made by the death of Becket, to
chuse Roger, prior of Dover, in the place of that turbulent prelate[n31].

{#21} #War with Scotland# ^The^ king of Scotland made an irruption into
Northumberland, and committed great devastations; but being opposed by Richard
de Lucy, whom Henry had left guardian of the realm, he retreated into his own
country, and agreed to a cessation of arms. This truce enabled the guardian to
march southwards with his army, in order to oppose an invasion, which the earl
of Leicester, at the head of a great body of Flemings, had made upon Suffolk.
The Flemings had been joined by Hugh Bigod, who made them masters of his castle
of Framlingham; and marching into the heart of the kingdom, where they hoped to
be supported by Leicester's vassals, they were met by Lucy, who, assisted by
Humphry Bohun, the constable, and the earls of Arundel, Glocester, and Cornwal,
had advanced to Farnham with a less numerous, but braver army, to oppose them.
The Flemings, who were mostly weavers and artificers (for manufactures were now
beginning to be established in Flanders) were broken in an instant, ten thousand
of them were put to the sword, the earl of Leicester was taken prisoner, and the
remains of the invaders were glad to compound for a safe retreat into their own
country.

{#22} #1174.# ^This^ great defeat did not dishearten the malcontents; who, being
supported by the alliance of so many foreign princes, and encouraged by the
king's own sons, determined to persevere in their enterprize. The earl of
Ferrars, Roger de Moubray, Archetil de Mallory, Richard de Moreville, Hamo de
Mascie, together with many friends of the earls of Leicester and Chester, rose
in arms: The fidelity of the earls of Clare and Glocester were suspected; and
the guardian, though vigorously supported by Geoffrey, Bishop of Lincoln, the
king's natural son by the fair Rosamond, found it difficult to defend himself on
all quarters, from so many open and concealed enemies. The more to augment the
confusion, the king of Scotland, on the expiration of the truce, broke into the
northern provinces with a great army[n32] of 80,000 men; which, though
undisciplined and disorderly, and better fitted for committing devastation, than
for executing any military enterprize, was become |dangerous from the present
factious and turbulent spirit of the kingdom. Henry, who had baffled all his
enemies in France, and had put his frontiers in a posture of defence, now found
England the seat of danger; and he determined by his presence to overawe the
malcontents, or by his conduct and courage to subdue them. He landed at
Southampton; #8th July. Penance of Henry for Becket's murder.# and knowing the
influence of superstition over the minds of the people, he hastened to
Canterbury, in order to make atonement to the ashes of Thomas a Becket, and
tender his submissions to a dead enemy. As soon as he came within sight of the
church of Canterbury, he dismounted, walked barefoot towards it, prostrated
himself before the shrine of the saint, remained in fasting and prayer during a
whole day, and watched all night the holy reliques. Not content with this
hypocritical devotion towards a man, whose violence and ingratitude had so long
disquieted his government, and had been the object of his most inveterate
animosity, he submitted to a pennance, still more singular and humiliating. He
assembled a chapter of the monks, disrobed himself before them, put a scourge of
discipline into the hands of each, and presented his bare shoulders to the
lashes which these ecclesiastics successively inflicted upon him. Next day, he
received absolution; and departing for London, got soon after the agreeable
intelligence of a great victory which his generals had obtained over the Scots,
and which, being gained, as was reported, on the very day of his absolution, was
regarded as the earnest of his final reconciliation with Heaven and with Thomas
a Becket.

{#23} ^William^, king of Scots, though repulsed before the castle of Prudhow,
and other fortified places, had committed the most horrible depredations upon
the northern provinces: But on the approach of Ralph de Glanville, the famous
justiciary, seconded by Bernard de Baliol, Robert de Stuteville, Odonel de
Umfreville, William de Vesci, and other northern barons, together with the
gallant bishop of Lincoln, he thought proper to retreat nearer his own country,
and he fixed his camp at Alnwic. He had here weakened his army extremely, by
sending out numerous detachments in order to extend his ravages; and he lay
absolutely safe, as he imagined, from any attack of the enemy. But Glanville,
informed of his situation, made a hasty and fatiguing march to Newcastle; and
allowing his soldiers only a small interval for refreshment, he immediately set
out towards evening for Alnwic. He marched that |night above thirty miles; #13th
July.# arrived in the morning, under cover of a mist, near the Scottish camp;
and regardless of the great numbers of the enemy, he began the attack with his
small, but determined, body of cavalry. William was living in such supine
security, that he took the English at first for a body of his own ravagers, who
were returning to the camp: But the sight of their banners convincing him of his
mistake, he entered on the action with no greater body than a hundred horse, in
confidence, that the numerous army, which surrounded him, #William, king of
Scotland, defeated and taken prisoner.# would soon hasten to his relief. He was
dismounted on the first shock, and taken prisoner; while his troops, hearing of
this disaster, fled on all sides with the utmost precipitation. The dispersed
ravagers made the best of their way to their own country; and discord arising
among them, they proceeded even to mutual hostilities, and suffered more from
each other's sword than from that of the enemy.

{#24} ^This^ great and important victory proved at last decisive in favour of
Henry, and entirely broke the spirit of the English rebels. The bishop of
Durham, who was preparing to revolt, made his submissions; Hugh Bigod, though he
had received a strong reinforcement of Flemings, was obliged to surrender all
his castles, and throw himself on the king's mercy; no better resource was left
to the earl of Ferrars and Roger de Moubray; the inferior rebels imitating the
example, all England was restored to tranquillity in a few weeks; and as the
king appeared to lie under the immediate protection of Heaven, it was deemed
impious any longer to resist him. The clergy exalted anew the merits and
powerful intercession of Becket; and Henry, instead of opposing this
superstition, plumed himself on the new friendship of the saint, and propagated
an opinion which was so favourable to his intrests[n33].

{#25} ^Prince^ Henry, who was ready to embark at Gravelines with the earl of
Flanders and a great army, hearing that his partizans in England were
suppressed, abandoned all thoughts of the enterprize, and joined the camp of
Lewis, who, during the absence of the king, had made an irruption into Normandy,
and had laid siege to Roüen[n34]. The place was defended with great vigour by
the inhabitants[n35]; and Lewis, despairing of success by open force, tried to
gain the town by a stratagem, which, in that superstitious age, was deemed not
very honourable. He proclaimed in his own camp |a cessation of arms, on pretence
of celebrating the festival of St. Laurence; and when the citizens, supposing
themselves in safety, were so imprudent as to remit their guard, he purposed to
take advantage of their security. Happily, some priests had, from mere
curiosity, mounted a steeple, where the alarm-bell hung; and observing the
French camp in motion, they immediately rang the bell, and gave warning to the
inhabitants, who ran to their several stations. The French, who, on hearing the
alarm, hurried to the assault, had already mounted the walls in several places;
but being repulsed by the enraged citizens, were obliged to retreat with
considerable loss[n36]. Next day, Henry, who had hastened to the defence of his
Norman dominions, passed over the bridge in triumph; and entered Roüen in sight
of the French army. The city was now in absolute safety; and the king, in order
to brave the French monarch, commanded the gates, which had been walled up, to
be opened; and he prepared to push his advantages against the enemy. Lewis saved
himself from this perilous situation by a new piece of deceit, not so
justifiable. He proposed a conference for adjusting the terms of a general
peace, which, he knew, would be greedily embraced by Henry; and while the king
of England trusted to the execution of his promise, he made a retreat with his
army into France.

{#26} ^There^ was, however, a necessity on both sides for an accommodation.
Henry could no longer bear to see his three sons in the hands of his enemy; and
Lewis dreaded, lest this great monarch, victorious in all quarters, crowned with
glory, and absolute master of his dominions, might take revenge for the many
dangers and disquietudes, which the arms, and still more the intrigues of
France, had, in his disputes both with Becket and his sons, found means to raise
him. After making a cessation of arms, a conference was agreed on near Tours;
where Henry granted his sons much less advantageous terms than he had formerly
offered; #The king's accommodation with his sons.# and he received their
submissions. The most material of his concessions were some pensions which he
stipulated to pay them, and some castles which he granted them for the place of
their residence; together with an indemnity for all their adherents, who were
restored to their estates and honours[n37].

{#27} ^Of^ all those who had embraced the cause of the young princes, William,
king of Scotland, was the only considerable loser, by that invidious and unjust
enterprize. Henry delivered from confinement, without exacting any ransom, about
nine hundred knights whom he had taken prisoners; but it cost William the
ancient independancy of his crown as the price of his liberty. He stipulated to
do homage to Henry for Scotland and all his other possessions; he engaged that
all the barons and nobility of his kingdom should also do homage; that the
bishops should take an oath of fealty; that both should swear to adhere to the
king of England against their native prince, if the latter should break his
engagements; #1175. 10th Aug.# and that the fortresses of Edinburgh, Stirling,
Berwic, Roxborough, and Jedborough should be delivered into Henry's hands, till
the performance of articles[n38]. This severe and humiliating treaty was
executed in its full rigour. William, being released, brought up all his barons,
prelates, and abbots; and they did homage to Henry in the cathedral of York, and
acknowledged him and his successors for their superior lord[n39]. The English
monarch stretched still farther the rigour of the conditions which he exacted.
He engaged the king and states of Scotland to make a perpetual cession of the
fortresses of Berwic and Roxborough, and to allow the castle of Edinburgh to
remain in his hands for a limited time. This was the first great ascendant which
England obtained over Scotland; and indeed the first important transaction which
had passed between the kingdoms. Few princes have been so fortunate as to gain
considerable advantages over their weaker neighbours with less violence and
injustice, than was practised by Henry against the king of Scots, whom he had
taken prisoner in battle, and who had wantonly engaged in a war, in which all
the neighbours of that prince, and even his own family, were, without
provocation, combined against him[n40].

{#28} #King's equitable administration.# ^Henry^, having thus, contrary to
expectation, extricated himself with honour from a situation, in which his
throne was exposed to great danger, was employed for several years in the
administration of justice, in the execution of the laws, and in guarding against
those inconveniences, which either the past convulsions of his state, or the
political institutions of that age, unavoidably occasioned. The provisions,
which he made, show such largeness of thought as qualified him for being a
legislator; and they were commonly calculated as well for the future as the
present happiness of his kingdom.

{#29} #1176.# ^He^ enacted severe penalties against robbery, murder, false
coining, arson; and ordained that these crimes should be punished by the
amputation of the right hand and right foot[n41]. The pecuniary commutation for
crimes, which has a false appearance of lenity, had been gradually disused; and
seems to have been entirely abolished by the rigour of these statutes. The
superstitious trial by water ordeal, though condemned by the church[n42], still
subsisted; but Henry ordained, that any man, accused of murder or any heinous
felony by the oath of the legal knights of the county, should, even though
acquitted by the ordeal, be obliged to abjure the realm[n43].

{#30} ^All^ advances towards reason and good sense are slow and gradual. Henry,
though sensible of the great absurdity attending the trial by duel or battle,
did not venture to abolish it: He only admitted either of the parties to
challenge a trial by an assize or jury of twelve freeholders[n44]. This latter
method of trial seems to have been very ancient in England, and was fixed by the
laws of king Alfred: But the barbarous and violent genius of the age had of late
given more credit to the trial by battle, which had become the general method of
deciding all important controversies. It was never abolished by law in England;
and there is an instance of it so late as the reign of Elizabeth: But the
institution revived by this king, being found more reasonable and more suitable
to a civilized people, gradually prevailed over it.

{#31} ^The^ partition of England into four divisions, and the appointment of
itinerant justices to go the circuit in each division, |and to decide the causes
in the counties, was another important ordinance of this prince, which had a
direct tendency to curb the oppressive barons, and to protect the inferior
gentry and common people in their property[n45]. Those justices were either
prelates or considerable noblemen; who, besides carrying the authority of the
king's commission, were able, by the dignity of their own character, to give
weight and credit to the laws.

{#32} ^That^ there might be fewer obstacles to the execution of justice, the
king was vigilant in demolishing all the new erected castles of the nobility, in
England as well as in his foreign dominions; and he permitted no fortress to
remain in the custody of those whom he found reason to suspect[n46].

{#33} ^But^ lest the kingdom should be weakened by this demolition of the
fortresses, the king fixed an assize of arms, by which all his subjects were
obliged to put themselves in a situation for defending themselves and the realm.
Every man, possessed of a knight's fee, was ordained to have for each fee, a
coat of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance; every free layman, possessed of
goods to the value of sixteen marks, was to be armed in like manner; every one
that possessed ten marks was obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and
a lance; all burgesses were to have a cap of iron, a lance and a wambais; that
is, a coat quilted with wool, tow, or such like materials[n47]. It appears, that
archery, for which the English were afterwards so renowned, had not, at this
time, become very common among them. The spear was the chief weapon employed in
battle.

{#34} ^The^ clergy and the laity were during that age in a strange situation
with regard to each other, and such as may seem totally incompatible with a
civilized, and indeed with any species of government. If a clergyman were guilty
of murder, he could be punished by degradation only: If he were murdered, the
murderer was exposed to nothing but excommunication and ecclesiastical censures;
and the crime was atoned for by pennances and submission[n48]. Hence the
assassins of Thomas a Becket himself, though guilty of the most atrocious
wickedness, and the most repugnant to the sentiments of that age, lived securely
in their own houses, without |being called to account by Henry himself, who was
so much concerned, both in honour and interest, to punish that crime, and who
professed or affected on all occasions the most extreme abhorrence of it. It was
not till they found their presence shunned by every one as excommunicated
persons, that they were induced to take a journey to Rome, to throw themselves
at the feet of the pontiff, and to submit to the pennances imposed upon them:
After which, they continued to possess, without molestation, their honours and
fortunes, and seem even to have recovered the countenance and good opinion of
the public. But as the king, by the constitutions of Clarendon, which he
endeavoured still to maintain[n49], had subjected the clergy to a trial by the
civil magistrate, it seemed but just to give them the protection of that power,
to which they owed obedience: It was enacted, that the murderers of clergymen
should be tried before the justiciary in the presence of the bishop or his
official; and besides the usual punishment for murder, should be subjected to a
forfeiture of their estates, and a confiscation of their goods and
chattels[n50].

{#35} ^The^ king passed an equitable law, that the goods of a vassal should not
be seized for the debt of his lord, unless the vassal be surety for the debt;
and that the rents of vassals should be paid to the creditors of the lord, not
to the lord himself. It is remarkable, that this law was enacted by the king in
a council which he held at Verneüil, and which consisted of some prelates and
barons of England, as well as some of Normandy, Poictou, Anjou, Maine, Touraine,
and Britanny; and the statute took place in all these last mentioned
territories[n51], though totally unconnected with each other[n52]: A certain
proof how irregular the ancient feudal government was, and how near the
sovereigns, in some instances, approached to despotism, though in others they
seemed scarcely to possess any authority. If a prince, much dreaded and revered
like Henry, obtained but the appearance of general consent to an ordinance,
|which was equitable and just, it became immediately an established law, and all
his subjects acquiesced in it. If the prince was hated or despised; if the
nobles, who supported him, had small influence; if the humours of the times
disposed the people to question the justice of his ordinance; the fullest and
most authentic assembly had no authority. Thus all was confusion and disorder;
no regular idea of a constitution; force and violence decided every thing.

{#36} ^The^ success, which had attended Henry in his wars, did not much
encourage his neighbours to form any attempt against him; and his transactions
with them, during several years, contain little memorable. Scotland remained in
that state of feudal subjection, to which he had reduced it; and gave him no
farther inquietude. He sent over his fourth son, John, into Ireland, with a view
of making a more complete conquest of the island; but the petulance and
incapacity of this prince, by which he enraged the Irish chieftains, obliged the
king soon after to recall him[n53]. The king of France had fallen into an abject
superstition; and was induced by a devotion, more sincere than that of Henry, to
make a pilgrimage to the tomb of Becket, in order to obtain his intercession for
the cure of Philip, his eldest son. He probably thought himself well intitled to
the favour of that saint, on account of their ancient intimacy; and hoped, that
Becket, whom he had protected while on earth, would not now, when he was so
highly exalted in heaven, forget his old friend and benefactor. The monks,
sensible that their saint's honour was concerned in the case, failed not to
publish, that Lewis's prayers were answered, and that the young prince was
restored to health, by Becket's intercession. That king himself was soon after
struck with an apoplexy, which deprived him of his understanding: Philip, though
a youth of fifteen, took on him the administration, till his father's death,
which happened soon after, opened his way to the throne; and he proved the
ablest and greatest monarch that had governed that kingdom since the age of
Charlemagne. The superior years, however, and experience of Henry, while they
moderated his ambition, gave him such an ascendant over this prince, #1180.#
that no dangerous rivalship, for a long |time, arose between them. The English
monarch, instead of taking advantage of his own situation, rather employed his
good offices in composing the quarrels which arose in the royal family of
France; and he was successful in mediating a reconciliation between Philip and
his mother and uncles. These services were but ill-requited by Philip, who, when
he came to man's estate, fomented all the domestic discords in the royal family
of England, and encouraged Henry's sons in their ungrateful and undutiful
behaviour towards him.

{#37} ^Prince^ Henry, equally impatient of obtaining power, and incapable of
using it, renewed to the king the demand of his resigning Normandy; and on
meeting with a refusal, he fled with his consort to the court of France: But not
finding Philip, at that time, disposed to enter into war for his sake, he
accepted of his father's offers of reconciliation, and made him submissions. It
was a cruel circumstance in the king's fortune, that he could hope for no
tranquillity from the criminal enterprizes of his sons but by their mutual
discord and animosities, which disturbed his family, and threw his state into
convulsions. Richard, whom he had made master of Guienne, and who had displayed
his valour and military genius, by suppressing the revolts of his mutinous
barons, refused to obey Henry's orders, in doing homage to his elder brother for
that dutchy; and he defended himself against young Henry and Geoffrey, who,
uniting their arms, carried war into his territories[n54]. The king with some
difficulty composed this difference; but immediately found his eldest son
engaged in conspiracies, and ready to take arms against himself. While the young
prince was conducting these criminal intrigues, he was seized with a fever at
Martel, a castle near Turenne, to which he had retired in discontent; and seeing
the approaches of death, #1183.# he was at last struck with remorse for his
undutiful behaviour towards his father. He sent a message to the king, who was
not far distant; expressed his contrition for his faults; and entreated the
favour of a visit, that he might at least die with the satisfaction of having
obtained his forgiveness. Henry, who had so often experienced the prince's
ingratitude and violence, apprehended that his sickness was entirely feigned,
and he |durst not entrust himself into his son's hands: But when he soon after
received intelligence of young Henry's death, #11th June. Death of young Henry.#
and the proofs of his sincere repentance, this good prince was affected with the
deepest sorrow; he thrice fainted away; he accused his own hardheartedness in
refusing the dying request of his son; and he lamented, that he had deprived
that prince of the last opportunity of making atonement for his offences, and of
pouring out his soul in the bosom of his reconciled father[n55]. This prince
died in the twenty-eighth year of his age.

{#38} ^The^ behaviour of his surviving children did not tend to give the king
any consolation for the loss. As prince Henry had left no posterity, Richard was
become heir to all his dominions; and the king intended, that John, his third
surviving son and favourite, should inherit Guienne as his appanage: But Richard
refused his consent, fled into that dutchy, and even made preparations for
carrying on war, as well against his father as against his brother Geoffrey, who
was now put in possession of Britanny. Henry sent for Eleanor, his queen, the
heiress of Guienne, and required Richard to deliver up to her the dominion of
these territories; which that prince, either dreading an insurrection of the
Gascons in her favour, or retaining some sense of duty towards her, readily
performed; and he peaceably returned to his father's court. No sooner was this
quarrel accommodated, than Geoffrey, the most vicious perhaps of all Henry's
unhappy family, broke out into violence; demanded Anjou to be annexed to his
dominions of Britanny; and on meeting with a refusal, #1185.# fled to the court
of France, and levied forces against his father[n56]. Henry was freed from this
danger by his son's death, who was killed in a tournament at Paris[n57]. The
widow of Geoffrey, soon after his decease, was delivered of a son, who received
the name of Arthur, and was invested in the dutchy of Britanny, under the
guardianship of his grandfather, who, as duke of Normandy, was also superior
lord of that territory. Philip, as lord Paramount, disputed some time his title
to this wardship; but was obliged to yield to the inclinations of the Bretons,
who preferred the government of Henry.

{#39} #Crusades.# ^But^ the rivalship between these potent princes, and all
their |inferior interests, seemed now to have given place to the general passion
for the relief of the Holy Land, and the expulsion of the Saracens. Those
infidels, though obliged to yield to the immense inundation of Christians in the
first crusade, had recovered courage after the torrent was past; and attacking
on all quarters the settlements of the Europeans, had reduced these adventurers
to great difficulties, and obliged them to apply again for succours from the
west. A second crusade, under the emperor Conrade, and Lewis VII. king of
France, in which there perished above 200,000 men, brought them but a temporary
relief; and those princes, after losing such immense armies, and seeing the
flower of their nobility fall by their side, returned with little honour into
Europe. Bud these repeated misfortunes, which drained the western world of its
people and treasure, were not yet sufficient to cure men of their passion for
those spiritual adventures; and a new incident rekindled with fresh fury the
zeal of the ecclesiastics and military adventures among the Latin Christians.
Saladin, a prince of great generosity, bravery, and conduct, having fixed
himself on the throne of Egypt, began to extend his conquests over the east; and
finding the settlement of the Christians in Palestine an invincible obstacle to
the progress of his arms, he bent the whole force of his policy and valour to
subdue that small and barren, but important territory. Taking advantage of
dissentions, which prevailed among the champions of the cross, and having
secretly gained the count of Tripoli, who commanded their armies, he invaded the
frontiers with a mighty power; and, aided by the treachery of that count, gained
over them at Tiberiade a complete victory, #1187.# which utterly annihilated the
force of the already languishing kingdom of Jerusalem. The holy city itself fell
into his hands after a feeble resistance; the kingdom of Antioch was almost
entirely subdued; and except some maritime towns, nothing considerable remained
of those boasted conquests, which, near a century before, it had cost the
efforts of all Europe to acquire[n58].

{#40} ^The^ western Christians were astonished on receiving this dismal
intelligence. Pope Urban III. it is pretended, died of grief; and his successor,
Gregory VIII. employed the whole time of his short pontificate in rouzing to
arms all the Christians who acknowledged |his authority. The general cry was,
that they were unworthy of enjoying any inheritance in heaven, who did not
vindicate from the dominion of the infidels the inheritance of God on earth, and
deliver from slavery that country which had been consecrated by the footsteps of
their Redeemer. William, archbishop of Tyre, #1188. 21st January# having
procured a conference between Henry and Philip near Gisors, enforced all these
topics; gave a pathetic description of the miserable state of the eastern
Christians; and employed every argument to excite the ruling passions of the
age, superstition and jealousy of military honour[n59]: The two monarchs
immediately took the cross; many of their most considerable vassals imitated the
example[n60]; and as the emperor Frederic I. entered into the same confederacy,
some well-grounded hopes of success were entertained; and men flattered
themselves, that an enterprize, which had failed under the conduct of many
independant leaders, or of imprudent princes, might at last, by the efforts of
such potent and able monarchs, be brought to a happy issue.

{#41} ^The^ kings of France and England imposed a tax, amounting to the tenth of
all moveable goods, on such as remained at home[n61]; but as they exempted from
this burden most of the regular clergy, the secular aspired to the same
immunity; pretended that their duty obliged them to assist the crusade with
their prayers alone; and it was with some difficulty they were constrained to
desist from an opposition, which in them, who had been the chief promoters of
those pious enterprizes, appeared with the worst grace imaginable[n62]. This
backwardness of the clergy is perhaps a symptom, that the enthusiastic ardour,
which had at first seized the people for crusades, was now by time and ill
success considerably abated; and that the frenzy was chiefly supported by the
military genius and love of glory in the monarchs.

{#42} ^But^ before this great machine could be put in motion, there were still
many obstacles to surmount. Philip, jealous of Henry's power, entered into a
private confederacy with young Richard; and working on his ambitious and
impatient temper, persuaded him, #1189. Revolt of prince Richard.# instead of
supporting and aggrandizing that monarchy, which he was one day to inherit, to
seek present power and independance, by disturbing and dismembering it. In order
to give a pretence for hostilities between the two kings, Richard broke into
|the territories of Raymond, count of Toulouse, who immediately carried
complaints of this violence before the king of France as his superior lord.
Philip remonstrated with Henry; but received for answer, that Richard had
confessed to the archbishop of Dublin, that his enterprize against Raymond had
been undertaken by the approbation of Philip himself, and was conducted by his
authority. The king of France, who might have been covered with shame and
confusion by this detection, still prosecuted his design, and invaded the
provinces of Berri and Auvergne, under colour of revenging the quarrel of the
count of Toulouse[n63]. Henry retaliated, by making inroads upon the frontiers
of France, and burning Dreux. As this war, which destroyed all hopes of success
in the projected crusade, gave great scandal, the two kings held a conference at
the accustomed place between Gisors and Trie, in order to find means of
accommodating their differences: They separated on worse terms than before; and
Philip, to show his disgust, ordered a great elm, under which the conferences
had been usually held, to be cut down[n64]; as if he had renounced all desire of
accommodation, and was determined to carry the war to extremities against the
king of England. But his own vassals refused to serve under him in so invidious
a cause[n65]; and he was obliged to come anew to a conference with Henry, and to
offer terms of peace. These terms were such as entirely opened the eyes of the
king of England, and fully convinced him of the perfidy of his son, and his
secret alliance with Philip, of which he had before only entertained some
suspicion. The king of France required, that Richard should be crowned king of
England in the life-time of his father, should be invested in all his
transmarine dominions, and should immediately espouse Alice, Philip's sister, to
whom he had formerly been affianced, and who had already been conducted into
England[n66]. Henry had experienced such fatal effects, both from the crowning
of his eldest son, and from that prince's alliance with the royal family of
France, that he rejected these terms; and Richard, in consequence of his secret
agreement with Philip, immediately revolted from him[n67], did homage to the
king of France for all the dominions which Henry held of that crown, and
received the investitures, as if he had already been the lawful possessor.
Several historians assert, that Henry himself had become enamoured of |young
Alice, and mention this as an additional reason for his refusing these
conditions: But he had so many other just and equitable motives for his conduct,
that it is superfluous to assign a cause, which the great prudence and advanced
age of that monarch render somewhat improbable.

{#43} ^Cardinal^ Albano, the pope's legate, displeased with these encreasing
obstacles to the crusade, excommunicated Richard, as the chief spring of
discord: But the sentence of excommunication, which, when it was properly
prepared, and was zealously supported by the clergy, had often great influence
in that age, proved entirely ineffectual in the present case. The chief barons
of Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being attached to the young prince,
and finding that he had now received the investiture from their superior lord,
declared for him, and made inroads into the territories of such as still adhered
to the king. Henry, disquieted by the daily revolts of his mutinous subjects,
and dreading still worse effects from their turbulent disposition, had again
recourse to papal authority; and engaged the cardinal Anagni, who had succeeded
Albano in the legateship, to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his
dominions. But Philip, who was a prince of great vigour and capacity, despised
the menace, and told Anagni, that it belonged not to the pope to interpose in
the temporal disputes of princes, much less in those between him and his
rebellious vassal. He even proceeded so far as to reproach him with partiality,
and with receiving bribes from the king of England[n68]; while Richard, still
more outrageous, offered to draw his sword against the legate, and was hindered,
by the interposition alone of the company, from committing violence upon
him[n69].

{#44} ^The^ king of England was now obliged to defend his dominions by arms, and
to engage in a war with France and with his eldest son, a prince of great
valour, on such disadvantageous terms. Ferté-Barnard fell first into the hands
of the enemy: Mans was next taken by assault; and Henry, who had thrown himself
into that place, escaped with some difficulty[n70]: Amboise, Chaumont, and
Chateau de Loire, opened their gates on the appearance of Philip and Richard:
Tours was menaced; and the king, who had retired to Saumur, and had daily
instances of the cowardice or |infidelity of his governors, expected the most
dismal issue to all his enterprizes. While he was in this state of despondency,
the duke of Burgundy, the earl of Flanders, and the archbishop of Rheims
interposed with their good offices; and the intelligence, which he received of
the taking of Tours, and which made him fully sensible of the desperate
situation of his affairs, so subdued his spirit, that he submitted to all the
rigorous terms, which were imposed upon him. He agreed, that Richard should
marry the princess Alice; that that prince should receive the homage and oath of
fealty of all his subjects both in England and his transmarine dominions; that
he himself should pay twenty thousand marks to the king of France as a
compensation for the charges of the war; that his own barons should engage to
make him observe this treaty by force, and in case of his violating it, should
promise to join Philip and Richard against him; and that all his vassals, who
had entered into confederacy with Richard, should receive an indemnity for the
offence[n71].

{#45} ^But^ the mortification, which Henry, who had been accustomed to give the
law in most treaties, received from these disadvantageous terms, was the least
that he met with on this occasion. When he demanded a list of those barons, to
whom he was bound to grant a pardon for their connections with Richard; he was
astonished to find, at the head of them, the name of his second son, John[n72];
who had always been his favourite, whose interests he had ever anxiously at
heart, and who had even, on account of his ascendant over him, often excited the
jealousy of Richard[n73]. The unhappy father, already overloaded with cares and
sorrows, finding this last disappointment in his domestic tenderness, broke out
into expressions of the utmost despair, cursed the day in which he received his
miserable being, and bestowed, on his ungrateful and undutiful children, a
malediction which he never could be prevailed on to retract[n74]. The more his
heart was disposed to friendship and affection, the more he resented the
barbarous return, which his four sons had successively made to his parental
care; and this finishing blow, by depriving him of every comfort in life, quite
broke his spirit, #6th July. Death and character of Henry.# and threw him into a
lingering fever, of which he expired, at the castle of Chinon near Saumur. His
natural son, Geoffrey, who alone had behaved dutifully towards him, attended
|his corpse to the nunnery of Fontervrault; where it lay in state in the
abbey-church. Next day, Richard, who came to visit the dead body of his father,
and who, notwithstanding his criminal conduct, was not wholly destitute of
generosity, was struck with horror and remorse at the sight; and as the
attendants observed, that, at that very instant, blood gushed from the mouth and
nostrils of the corpse[n75], he exclaimed, agreeably to a vulgar superstition,
that he was his father's murderer; and he expressed a deep sense, though too
late, of that undutiful behaviour, which had brought his parent to an untimely
grave[n76].

{#46} ^Thus^ died, in the fifty-eighth year of his age and thirty-fifth of his
reign, the greatest prince of his time, for wisdom, virtue, and abilities, and
the most powerful in extent of dominion of all those that had ever filled the
throne of England. His character, in private as well as in public life, is
almost without a blemish; and he seems to have possessed every accomplishment
both of body and mind, which makes a man either estimable or amiable. He was of
a middle stature, strong and well proportioned; his countenance was lively and
engaging; his conversation affable and entertaining: His elocution easy,
persuasive, and ever at command. He loved peace, but possessed both bravery and
conduct in war; was provident without timidity; severe in the execution of
justice without rigour; and temperate without austerity. He preserved health,
and kept himself from corpulency, to which he was somewhat inclined, by an
abstemious diet, and by frequent exercise, particularly hunting. When he could
enjoy leisure, he recreated himself either in learned conversation or in
reading; and he cultivated his natural talents by study, above any prince of his
time. His affections, as well as his enmities, were warm and durable, and his
long experience of the ingratitude and infidelity of men never destroyed the
natural sensibility of his temper, which disposed him to friendship and society.
His character has been transmitted to us by several writers, who were his
contemporaries[n77]; and it extremely resembles, in its most remarkable
features, that of his maternal grandfather Henry I.: Excepting only, that
ambition, which was a ruling passion in both, found not in the first Henry such
unexceptionable |means of exerting itself, and pushed that prince into measures,
which were both criminal in themselves, and were the cause of farther crimes,
from which his grandson's conduct was happily exempted.

{#47} #Miscellaneous transactions of this reign.# ^This^ prince, like most of
his predecessors of the Norman line, except Stephen, passed more of his time on
the continent than in this island: He was surrounded with the English gentry and
nobility, when abroad: The French gentry and nobility attended him when he
resided in England: Both nations acted in the government, as if they were the
same people; and on many occasions, the legislatures seem not to have been
distinguished. As the king and all the English barons were of French extraction,
the manners of that people acquired the ascendant, and were regarded as the
models of imitation. All foreign improvements, therefore, such as they were, in
literature and politeness, in laws and arts, seem now to have been, in a good
measure, transplanted into England; and that kingdom was become little inferior,
in all the fashionable accomplishments, to any of its neighbours on the
continent. The more homely, but more sensible manners and principles of the
Saxons, were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the subtilties of
school philosophy: The feudal ideas of civil government, the Romish sentiments
in religion, had taken entire possession of the people: By the former, the sense
of submission towards princes was somewhat diminished in the barons; by the
latter, the devoted attachment to papal authority was much augmented among the
clergy. The Norman and other foreign families, established in England, had now
struck deep root; and being entirely incorporated with the people, whom at first
they oppressed and despised, they no longer thought that they needed the
protection of the crown for the enjoyment of their possessions, or considered
their tenure as precarious. They aspired to the same liberty and independance,
which they saw enjoyed by their brethren on the continent, and desired to
restrain those exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the
necessities of war and the violence of conquest had at first obliged them to
indulge in their monarch. That memory also of a more equal government under the
Saxon princes, which remained with the English, diffused still farther the
spirit of liberty, and made the barons both desirous of more independance to
themselves, and willing to indulge |it to the people. And it was not long ere
this secret revolution in the sentiments of men produced, first violent
convulsions in the state, then an evident alteration in the maxims of
government.

{#48} ^The^ history of all the preceding kings of England since the conquest,
gives evident proofs of the disorders attending the feudal institutions; the
licentiousness of the barons, their spirit of rebellion against the prince and
laws, and of animosity against each other: The conduct of the barons in the
transmarine dominions of those monarchs afforded perhaps still more flagrant
instances of these convulsions; and the history of France, during several ages,
consists almost entirely of narrations of this nature. The cities, during the
continuance of this violent government, could neither be very numerous nor
populous; and there occur instances, which seem to evince, that, though these
are always the first seat of law and liberty, their police was in general loose
and irregular, and exposed to the same disorders, with those by which the
country was generally infested. It was a custom in London for great numbers, to
the amount of a hundred or more, the sons and relations of considerable
citizens, to form themselves into a licentious confederacy, to break into rich
houses and plunder them, to rob and murder the passengers, and to commit with
impunity all sorts of disorder. By these crimes, it had become so dangerous to
walk the streets by night, that the citizens durst no more venture abroad after
sun-set, than if they had been exposed to the incursions of a public enemy. The
brother of the earl of Ferrars had been murdered by some of those nocturnal
rioters; and the death of so eminent a person, which was much more regarded than
that of many thousands of an inferior station, so provoked the king, that he
swore vengeance against the criminals, and became thenceforth more rigorous in
the execution of the laws[n78].

{#49} ^There^ is another instance given by historians, which proves to what a
height such riots had proceeded, and how open these criminals were in committing
their robberies. A band of them had attacked the house of a rich citizen, with
an intention of plundering it; had broken through a stone-wall with hammers and
wedges; and had already entered the house sword in hand; when the citizen, armed
cap-a-pee and supported by his faithful servants, |appeared in the passage to
oppose them: He cut off the right hand of the first robber that entered; and
made such stout resistance, that his neighbours had leisure to assemble, and
come to his relief. The man, who lost his hand, was taken; and was tempted by
the promise of pardon to reveal his confederates; among whom was one John Senex,
esteemed among the richest and best-born citizens in London. He was convicted by
the ordeal; and though he offered five hundred marks for his life, the king
refused the money, and ordered him to be hanged[n79]. It appears from a statute
of Edward I. that these disorders were not remedied even in that reign. It was
then made penal to go out at night after the hour of the curfew, to carry a
weapon, or to walk without a light or lanthorn[n80]. It is said in the preamble
to this law, that, both by night and by day, there were continual frays in the
streets of London.

{#50} ^Henry^'s care in administering justice had gained him so great a
reputation, that even foreign and distant princes made him arbiter, and
submitted their differences to his judgment. Sanchez, king of Navarre, having
some controversies with Alfonso, king of Castile, was contented, though Alfonso
had married the daughter of Henry, to chuse this prince for a referee; and they
agreed, each of them to consign three castles into neutral hands, as a pledge of
their not departing from his award. Henry made the cause be examined before his
great council, and gave a sentence, which was submitted to by both parties.
These two Spanish kings sent each a stout champion to the court of England, in
order to defend his cause by arms, in case the way of duel had been chosen by
Henry[n81].

{#51} ^Henry^ so far abolished the barbarous and absurd practice of confiscating
ships, which had been wrecked on the coast, that he ordained, if one man or
animal were alive in the ship, that the vessel and goods should be restored to
the owners[n82].

{#52} ^The^ reign of Henry was remarkable also for an innovation, which was
afterwards carried farther by his successors, and was attended with the most
important consequences. This prince was disgusted with the species of military
force, which was established by the feudal institutions, and which, though it
was extremely burdensome to the subject, yet rendered very little service to the
|sovereign. The barons, or military tenants, came late into the field; they were
obliged to serve only forty days; they were unskilful and disorderly in all
their operations; and they were apt to carry into the camp the same refractory
and independant spirit, to which they were accustomed in their civil government.
Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of making a commutation of their
military service for money; and he levied scutages from his baronies and knights
fees, instead of requiring the personal attendance of his vassals. There is
mention made, in the history of the exchequer, of these scutages in his second,
fifth, and eighteenth year[n83]; and other writers give us an account of three
more of them[n84]. When the prince had thus obtained money, he made a contract
with some of those adventurers, in which Europe at that time abounded: They
found him soldiers of the same character with themselves who were bound to serve
for a stipulated time: The armies were less numerous, but more useful, than when
composed of all the military vassals of the crown: The feudal institutions began
to relax: The kings became rapacious for money, on which all their power
depended: The barons, seeing no end of exactions, sought to defend their
property: And as the same causes had nearly the same effects, in the different
countries of Europe, the several crowns either lost or acquired authority,
according to their different success in the contest.

{#53} ^This^ prince was also the first that levied a tax on the moveables or
personal estates of his subjects, nobles as well as commons. Their zeal for the
holy wars made them submit to this innovation; and a precedent being once
obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns, the usual method of
supplying the necessities of the crown. The tax of Danegelt, so generally odious
to the nation, was remitted in this reign.

{#54} ^It^ was a usual practice of the kings of England, to repeat the ceremony
of their coronation thrice every year, on assembling the states at the three
great festivals. Henry, after the first years of his reign, never renewed this
ceremony, which was found to be very expensive and very useless. None of his
successors revived it. It is considered as a great act of grace in this prince,
that he mitigated |the rigour of the forest laws, and punished any
transgressions of them, not capitally, but by fines, imprisonments, and other
more moderate penalties.

{#55} ^Since^ we are here collecting some detached incidents, which show the
genius of the age, and which could not so well enter into the body of our
history, it may not be improper to mention the quarrel between Roger archbishop
of York, and Richard archbishop of Canterbury. We may judge of the violence of
military men and laymen, when ecclesiastics could proceed to such extremities.
Cardinal Haguezun being sent, in 1176, as legate into Britain, summoned an
assembly of the clergy at London; and as both the archbishops pretended to sit
on his right hand, this question of precedency begat a controversy between them.
The monks and retainers of archbishop Richard fell upon Roger, in the presence
of the cardinal and of the synod, threw him to the ground, trampled him under
foot, and so bruised him with blows, that he was taken up half dead, and his
life was, with difficulty, saved from their violence. The archbishop of
Canterbury was obliged to pay a large sum of money to the legate, in order to
suppress all complaints with regard to this enormity[n85].

{#56} ^We^ are told by Gyraldus Cambrensis, that the monks and prior of St.
Swithun threw themselves, one day, prostrate on the ground and in the mire
before Henry, complaining, with many tears and much doleful lamentation, that
the bishop of Winchester, who was also their abbot, had cut off three dishes
from their table. How many has he left you, said the king? Ten only, replied the
disconsolate monks. I myself, exclaimed the king, never have more than three;
and I enjoin your bishop to reduce you to the same number[n86].

{#57} ^This^ king left only two legitimate sons, Richard, who succeeded him, and
John, who inherited no territory, though his father had often intended to leave
him a part of his extensive dominions. He was thence commonly denominated
_Lackland._ Henry left three legitimate daughters; Maud, born in 1156, and
married to Henry, duke of Saxony; Eleanor, born in 1162, and married to
Alphonso, |king of Castile; Joan, born in 1165, and married to William, king of
Sicily[n87].

{#58} ^Henry^ is said by ancient historians to have been of a very amorous
disposition: They mention two of his natural sons by Rosamond, daughter of lord
Clifford, namely Richard Longespée, or Longsword, (so called from the sword he
usually wore) who was afterwards married to Ela, the daughter and heir of the
earl of Salisbury; and Geoffrey, first bishop of Lincoln, then archbishop of
York. All the other circumstances of the story, commonly told of that lady, seem
to be fabulous.

marks, and yet was levied with great difficulty. Indeed, two thirds of it only
could be paid before his deliverance.
