{#1} THE curiosity, entertained by all civilized nations, of
enquiring into the exploits and adventures of their ancestors, commonly excites
a regret that the history of remote ages should always be so much involved in
obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction. Ingenious men, possessed of leisure,
are apt to push their researches beyond the period, in which literary monuments
are framed or preserved; without reflecting, that the history of past events is
immediately lost or disfigured, when intrusted to memory and oral tradition, and
that the adventures of barbarous nations, even if they were recorded, could
afford little or no entertainment to men born in a more cultivated age. The
convulsions of a civilized state usually compose the most instructive and most
interesting part of its history; but the sudden, violent, and unprepared
revolutions, incident to Barbarians, are so much guided by caprice, and
terminate so often in cruelty that they disgust us by |the uniformity of their
appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that they are buried in
silence and oblivion. The only certain means, by which nations can indulge their
curiosity in researches concerning their remote origin, is to consider the
language, manners, and customs of their ancestors, and to compare them with
those of the neighbouring nations. The fables, which are commonly employed to
supply the place of true history, ought entirely to be disregarded; or if any
exception be admitted to this general rule, it can only be in favour of the
ancient Grecian fictions, which are so celebrated and so agreeable, that they
will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind. Neglecting, therefore, all
traditions or rather tales concerning the more early history of Britain, we
shall only consider the state of the inhabitants, as it appeared to the Romans
on their invasion of this country: We shall briefly run over the events, which
attended the conquest made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than
British story: We shall hasten through the obscure and uninteresting period of
Saxon annals: And shall reserve a more full narration for those times, when the
truth is both so well ascertained and so complete as to promise entertainment
and instruction to the reader.

{#2} ^All^ ancient writers agree in representing the first
inhabitants of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae, who peopled that
island from the neighbouring continent. Their language was the same, their
manners, their government, their superstition; varied only by those small
differences, which time or a communication with the bordering nations must
necessarily introduce. The inhabitants of Gaul, especially in those parts which
lie contiguous to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with their southern
neighbours, some refinement in the arts, which gradually diffused themselves
northwards, and spread but a very faint light over this island. The Greek and
Roman navigators or merchants (for there were scarcely any other travellers in
those ages) brought back the most shocking accounts of the ferocity of the
people, which they magnified, as usual, in order to excite the admiration of
their countrymen. The south-east parts, however, of Britain, had already, before
the age of Caesar, made the first and most requisite step toward a civil
settlement; and the Britons, by tillage and agriculture, had there encreased to
a great multitude[n1]. The other inhabitants of the island |still maintained
themselves by pasture: They were clothed with skins of beasts: They dwelt in
huts, which they reared in the forests and marshes, with which the country was
covered: They shifted easily their habitation, when actuated either by the hopes
of plunder or the fear of an enemy: The convenience of feeding their cattle was
even a sufficient motive for removing their seats: And as they were ignorant of
all the refinements of life, their wants and their possessions were equally
scanty and limited.

{#3} ^The^ Britons were divided into many small nations or
tribes; and being a military people, whose sole property was their arms and
their cattle, it was impossible, after they had acquired a relish of liberty,
for their princes or chieftains to establish any despotic authority over them.
Their governments, though monarchical[n2], were free, as well as those of all
the Celtic nations; and the common people seem even to have enjoyed more liberty
among them[n3], than among the nations of Gaul[n4], from whom they were
descended. Each state was divided into factions within itself[n5]. It was
agitated with jealousy or animosity against the neighbouring states: And while
the arts of peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupation, and formed
the chief object of ambition, among the people.

{#4} ^The^ religion of the Britons was one of the most
considerable parts of their government; and the Druids, who were their priests,
possessed great authority among them. Besides ministering at the altar, and
directing all religious duties, they presided over the education of youth; they
enjoyed an immunity from wars and taxes; they possessed both the civil and
criminal jurisdiction; they decided all controversies among states as well as
among private persons, and whoever refused to submit to their decree was exposed
to the most severe penalties. The sentence of excommunication was pronounced
against him: He was forbidden access to the sacrifices or public worship: He was
debarred all intercourse with his fellow-citizens, even in the common affairs of
life: His company was universally shunned, as profane and dangerous: He was
refused the protection of law[n6]: And death itself became an acceptable relief
from the misery and infamy to which he was exposed. Thus, the bands of
government, which were naturally |loose among that rude and turbulent people,
were happily corroborated by the terrors of their superstition.

{#5} ^No^ species of superstition was ever more terrible than
that of the Druids. Besides the severe penalties, which it was in the power of
the ecclesiastics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal
transmigration of souls; and thereby extended their authority as far as the
fears of their timorous votaries. They practised their rites in dark groves or
other secret recesses[n7]; and in order to throw a greater mystery over their
religion, they communicated their doctrines only to the initiated, and strictly
forbad the committing of them to writing, lest they should at any time be
exposed to the examination of the profane vulgar. Human sacrifices were
practised among them: The spoils of war were often devoted to their divinities;
and they punished with the severest tortures whoever dared to secrete any part
of the consecrated offering: These treasures they kept in woods and forests,
secured by no other guard than the terrors of their religion[n8]; and this
steddy conquest over human avidity may be regarded as more signal than their
prompting men to the most extraordinary and most violent efforts. No idolatrous
worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the ancient
Gauls and Britons; and the Romans, after their conquest, finding it impossible
to reconcile those nations to the laws and institutions of their masters, while
it maintained its authority, were at last obliged to abolish it by penal
statutes; a violence, which had never in any other instance been practised by
those tolerating conquerors[n9].

{#6} THE Britons had long remained in this rude but independent
state, when Caesar, having over-run all Gaul by his victories, first cast his
eye on their island. He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but
being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new world, then mostly
unknown, he took advantage of a short interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an
|invasion on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention, were sensible of
the unequal contest, and endeavoured to appease him by submissions, which,
however, retarded not the execution of his design. After some resistance, he
landed, as is supposed, at Deal; and having obtained several advantages over the
Britons and obliged them to promise hostages for their future obedience,
#Anno ante C. 55.# he was constrained, by the necessity of his
affairs, and the approach of winter, to withdraw his forces into Gaul. The
Britons, relieved from the terror of his arms, neglected the performance of
their stipulations; and that haughty conqueror resolved next summer to chastise
them for this breach of treaty. He landed with a greater force; and though he
found a more regular resistance from the Britons, who had united under
Cassivelaunus, one of their petty princes; he discomfited them in every action.
He advanced into the country; passed the Thames in the face of the enemy; took
and burned the capital of Cassivelaunus; established his ally, Mandubratius, in
the sovereignty of the Trinobantes; and having obliged the inhabitants to make
him new submissions, he again returned with his army into Gaul, and left the
authority of the Romans more nominal than real in this island.

{#7} ^The^ civil wars, which ensued, and which prepared the way
for the establishment of monarchy in Rome, saved the Britons from that yoke,
which was ready to be imposed upon them. Augustus, the successor of Caesar,
content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own country, was
little ambitious of acquiring fame by foreign wars; and being apprehensive lest
the same unlimited extent of dominion, which had subverted the republic, might
also overwhelm the empire, he recommended it to his successors never to enlarge
the territories of the Romans. Tiberius, jealous of the fame, which might be
acquired by his generals, made this advice of Augustus a pretence for his
inactivity[n10]. The mad sallies of Caligula, in which he menaced Britain with
an invasion, served only to expose himself and the empire to ridicule: And the
Britons had now, during almost a century, enjoyed their liberty unmolested; when
the Romans, in the reign of Claudius, began to think seriously of reducing them
under their dominion. Without seeking any more justifiable reasons of hostility
than were employed by the |late Europeans in subjecting the Africans and
Americans, #A.D. 43.# they sent over an army under the command of
Plautius, an able general, who gained some victories, and made a considerable
progress in subduing the inhabitants. Claudius himself, finding matters
sufficiently prepared for his reception, made a journey into Britain; and
received the submission of several British states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Regni,
and Trinobantes, who inhabited the southeast parts of the island, and whom their
possessions and more cultivated manner of life rendered willing to purchase
peace at the expence of their liberty. The other Britons, under the command of
Caractacus, still maintained an obstinate resistance, and the Romans made little
progress against them; till Ostorius Scapula was sent over to command their
armies. #A.D. 50.# This general advanced the Roman conquests over
the Britons; pierced into the country of the Silures, a warlike nation, who
inhabited the banks of the Severne; defeated Caractacus in a great battle; took
him prisoner, and sent him to Rome, where his magnanimous behaviour procured him
better treatment than those conquerors usually bestowed on captive princes[n11].

{#8} ^Notwithstanding^ these misfortunes, the Britons were not
subdued; and this island was regarded by the ambitious Romans as a field in
which military honour might still be acquired. Under the reign of Nero,
#A.D. 59.# Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command, and
prepared to signalize his name by victories over those barbarians. Finding that
the island of Mona, now Anglesey, was the chief seat of the Druids, he resolved
to attack it, and to subject a place, which was the center of their
superstition, and which afforded protection to all their baffled forces. The
Britons endeavoured to obstruct his landing on this sacred island, both by the
force of their arms and the terrors of their religion. The women and priests
were intermingled with the soldiers upon the shore; and running about with
flaming torches in their hands, and tossing their dishevelled hair, they struck
greater terror into the astonished Romans by their howlings, cries, and
execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was able to inspire. But
Suetonius, exhorting his troops to despise the menaces of a superstition, which
they despised, impelled them to the attack, drove the Britons off the field,
|burned the Druids in the same fires which those priests had prepared for their
captive enemies, destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars; and, having
thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, he thought his future progress
would be easy, in reducing the people to subjection. But he was disappointed in
his expectations. The Britons, taking advantage of his absence, were all in
arms; and headed by Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the
most ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked with success
several settlements of their insulting conquerors. Suetonius hastened to the
protection of London, which was already a flourishing Roman colony; but he found
on his arrival, that it would be requisite for the general safety to abandon
that place to the merciless fury of the enemy. London was reduced to ashes; such
of the inhabitants as remained in it, were cruelly massacred; the Romans and all
strangers, to the number of 70,000, were every where put to the sword without
distinction; and the Britons, by rendering the war thus bloody, seemed
determined to cut off all hopes of peace or composition with the enemy. But this
cruelty was revenged by Suetonius in a great and decisive battle, where 80,000
of the Britons are said to have perished; and Boadicea herself, rather than fall
into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life by poison[n12].
Nero soon after recalled Suetonius from a government, where, by suffering and
inflicting so many severities, he was judged improper for composing the angry
and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After some interval, Cerealis received the
command from Vespasian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman
arms. Julius Frontinus succeeded Cerealis both in authority and in reputation:
But the general, who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this
island, was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus,
and Domitian, and distinguished himself in that scene of action.

{#9} ^This^ great commander formed a regular plan for subduing
Britain, and rendering the acquisition useful to the conquerors. He carried his
victorious arms northwards, defeated the Britons in every encounter, pierced
into the inaccessible forests and mountains of Caledonia, reduced every state to
subjection in the southern |parts of the island, and chaced before him all the
men of fiercer and more intractable spirits, who deemed war and death itself
less intolerable than servitude under the victors. He even defeated them in a
decisive action, which they sought under Galgacus, their leader; and having
fixed a chain of garrisons, between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he thereby
cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island, and secured the Roman
province from the incursions of the barbarous inhabitants[n13].

{#10} ^During^ these military enterprizes, he neglected not the
arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britons, taught them to
desire and raise all the conveniencies of life, reconciled them to the Roman
language and manners, instructed them in letters and science, and employed every
expedient to render those chains, which he had forged, both easy and agreeable
to them[n14]. The inhabitants, having experienced how unequal their own force
was to resist that of the Romans, acquiesced in the dominion of their masters,
and were gradually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.

{#11} ^This^ was the last durable conquest made by the Romans;
and Britain, once subdued, gave no farther inquietude to the victor. Caledonia
alone, defended by barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Romans
entertained for it, sometimes infested the more cultivated parts of the island
by the incursions of its inhabitants. The better to secure the frontiers of the
empire, Adrian, who visited this island, built a rampart between the river Tyne
and the frith of Solway: Lollius Urbicus, under Antoninus Pius, erected one in
the place where Agricola had formerly established his garrisons: Severus, who
made an expedition into Britain, and carried his arms to the most northern
extremity of it, added new fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during the
reign of all the Roman emperors, such a profound tranquillity prevailed in
Britain, that little mention is made of the affairs of that island by any
historian. The only incidents, which occur, are some seditions or rebellions of
the Roman legions quartered there, and some usurpations of the imperial dignity
by the Roman governors. The natives, disarmed, dispirited, and submissive, had
left all desire and even idea of their former liberty and independence.

{#12} ^But^ the period was now come, when that enormous fabric
of the Roman empire, which had diffused slavery and oppression, together with
peace and civility, over so considerable a part of the globe, was approaching
towards its final dissolution. Italy, and the center of the empire, removed,
during so many ages, from all concern in the wars, had entirely lost the
military spirit, and were peopled by an enervated race, equally disposed to
submit to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their own rulers. The emperors
found themselves obliged to recruit their legions from the frontier provinces,
where the genius of war, though languishing, was not totally extinct; and these
mercenary forces, careless of laws and civil institutions, established a
military government, no less dangerous to the sovereign than to the people. The
farther progress of the same disorders introduced the bordering barbarians into
the service of the Romans; and those fierce nations, having now added discipline
to their native bravery, could no longer be restrained by the impotent policy of
the emperors, who were accustomed to employ one in the destruction of the
others. Sensible of their own force, and allured by the prospect of so rich a
prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, assailed
at once all the frontiers of the Roman empire; and having first satiated their
avidity by plunder, began to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted
provinces. The more distant barbarians, who occupied the deserted habitations of
the former, advanced in their acquisitions, and pressed with their incumbent
weight the Roman state, already unequal to the load which it sustained. Instead
of arming the people in their own defence, the emperors recalled all the distant
legions, in whom alone they could repose confidence; and collected the whole
military force for the defence of the capital and center of the empire. The
necessity of self-preservation had superseded the ambition of power; and the
ancient point of honour, never to contract the limits of the empire, could no
longer be attended to in this desperate extremity.

{#13} ^Britain^ by its situation was removed from the fury of
these barbarous incursions; and being also a remote province, not much valued by
the Romans, the legions, which defended it, were carried over to the protection
of Italy and Gaul. But that province, though secured by the sea against the
inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians, found enemies on its frontiers, who
took advantage of |its present defenceless situation. The Picts and Scots, who
dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incursions upon
their peaceable and effeminate neighbours; and besides the temporary
depredations which they committed, these combined nations threatened the whole
province with subjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded, with plunder
and devastation. The Picts seem to have been a tribe of the native British race,
who, having been chaced into the northern parts by the conquests of Agricola,
had there intermingled with the ancient inhabitants: The Scots were derived from
the same Celtic origin, had first been established in Ireland, had migrated to
the north-west coasts of this island, and had long been accustomed, as well from
their old as their new feats, to infest the Roman province by pyracy and
rapine[n15]. These tribes, finding their more opulent neighbours exposed to
invasion, soon broke over the Roman wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms;
and though a contemptible enemy in themselves, met with no resistance from the
unwarlike inhabitants. The Britons, accustomed to have recourse to the emperors
for defence as well as government, made supplications to Rome; and one legion
was sent over for their protection. This force was an over-match for the
barbarians, repelled their invasion, routed them in every engagement, and having
chaced them into their ancient limits, returned in triumph to the defence of the
southern provinces of the empire[n16]. Their retreat brought on a new invasion
of the enemy. The Britons made again an application to Rome, and again obtained
the assistance of a legion, which proved effectual for their relief: But the
Romans, reduced to extremities at home, and fatigued with those distant
expeditions, informed the Britons that they must no longer look to them for
succour, exhorted them to arm in their own defence, and urged, that, as they
were now their own masters, it became them to protect by their valour that
independence, which their ancient lords had conferred upon them[n17]. That they
might leave the island with the better grace, the Romans assisted them in
erecting anew the wall of Severus, which was built entirely of stone, and which
the Britons had not at that time artificers skillful enough to repair[n18]. And
having done this |last good office to the inhabitants, they bid a final adieu to
Britain, about the year 448; after being masters of the more considerable part
of it during the course of near four centuries.

{#14} THE abject Britons regarded this present of liberty as
fatal to them; and were in no condition to put in practice the prudent counsel
given them by the Romans, to arm in their own defence. Unaccustomed both to the
perils of war, and to the cares of civil government, they found themselves
incapable of forming or executing any measures for resisting the incursions of
the barbarians. Gratian also and Constantine, two Romans who had a little before
assumed the purple in Britain, had carried over to the continent the flower of
the British youth; and having perished in their unsuccessful attempts on the
imperial throne, had despoiled the island of those, who, in this desperate
extremity, were best able to defend it. The Picts and Scots, finding that the
Romans had finally relinquished Britain, now regarded the whole as their prey,
and attacked the northern wall with redoubled forces. The Britons, already
subdued by their own fears, found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and
deserting their station, left the country entirely open to the inroads of the
barbarous enemy. The invaders carried devastation and ruin along with them; and
exerted to the utmost their native ferocity, which was not mitigated by the
helpless condition and submissive behaviour of the inhabitants[n19]. The unhappy
Britons had a third time recourse to Rome, which had declared its resolution for
ever to abandon them. Aetius, the patrician, sustained, at that time, by his
valour and magnanimity, the towering ruins of the empire, and revived for a
moment among the degenerate Romans the spirit, as well as discipline, of their
ancestors. The British ambassadors carried to him the letter of their
countrymen, which was inscribed, _The Groans of the Britons._ The tenor of the
epistle was suitable to its superscription. _The barbarians,_ say they, _on the
one hand, chace us into the|_ sea; the sea, on the other, throws us back upon
the barbarians; and we have only the hard choice left us, of perishing by the
sword or by the waves[n20]. But Aetius, pressed by the arms of Attila, the most
terrible enemy that ever assailed the empire, had no leisure to attend to the
complaints of allies, whom generosity alone could induce him to assist[n21]. The
Britons, thus rejected, were reduced to despair, deserted their habitations,
abandoned tillage, and flying for protection to the forests and mountains,
suffered equally from hunger and from the enemy. The barbarians themselves began
to feel the pressures of famine in a country which they had ravaged; and being
harassed by the dispersed Britons, who had not dared to resist them in a body,
they retreated with their spoils into their own country[n22].

{#15} ^The^ Britons, taking advantage of this interval, returned
to their usual occupations; and the favourable seasons which succeeded,
seconding their industry, made them soon forget their past miseries, and
restored to them great plenty of all the necessaries of life. No more can be
imagined to have been possessed by a people so rude, who had not, without the
assistance of the Romans, art of masonry sufficient to raise a stone rampart for
their own defence: Yet the Monkish historians[n23], who treat of those events,
complain of the luxury of the Britons during this period, and ascribe to that
vice, not to their cowardice or improvident counsels, all their subsequent
calamities.

{#16} ^The^ Britons, entirely occupied in the enjoyment of the
present interval of peace, made no provision for resisting the enemy, who,
invited by their former timid behaviour, soon threatened them with a new
invasion. We are not exactly informed what species of civil government the
Romans on their departure had left among the Britons; but it appears probable,
that the great men in the different districts assumed a kind of regal, though
precarious authority; and lived in a great measure independant of each
other[n24]. To this disunion of counsels were also added the disputes of
theology; and the disciples of Pelagius, who was himself a native of Britain,
having encreased to a great multitude, gave alarm to the clergy, who seem to
have been more intent on suppressing them, than on opposing the public
enemy[n25]. Labouring under these domestic |evils, and menaced with a foreign
invasion, the Britons attended only to the suggestions of their present fears;
and following the counsels of Vortigern, prince of Dumnonium, who, though
stained with every vice, possessed the chief authority among them[n26], they
sent into Germany a deputation to invite over the Saxons for their protection
and assistance.

{#17} OF all the barbarous nations, known either in ancient or
modern times, the Germans seem to have been the most distinguished both by their
manners and political institutions, and to have carried to the highest pitch the
virtues of valour and love of liberty; the only virtues which can have place
among an uncivilized people, where justice and humanity are commonly neglected.
Kingly government, even when established among the Germans, (for it was not
universal) possessed a very limited authority; and though the sovereign was
usually chosen from among the royal family, he was directed in every measure by
the common consent of the nation, over whom he presided. When any important
affairs were transacted, all the warriors met in arms; the men of greatest
authority employed persuasion to engage their consent; the people expressed
their approbation by rattling their armour, or their dissent by murmurs; there
was no necessity for a nice scrutiny of votes among a multitude, who were
usually carried with a strong current to one side or the other; and the measure,
thus suddenly chosen by general agreement, was executed with alacrity, and
prosecuted with vigour. Even in war, the princes governed more by example than
by authority: But in peace, the civil union was in a great measure dissolved,
and the inferior leaders administered justice, after an independant manner, each
in his particular district. These were elected by the votes of the people in
their great councils; and though regard was paid to nobility in the choice,
their personal qualities, chiefly their valour, procured them, from the
suffrages of their fellow-citizens, that honorable but dangerous distinction.
The warriors of each tribe attached |themselves to their leader, with the most
devoted affection and most unshaken constancy. They attended him as his ornament
in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in the administration of
justice. Their constant emulation in military renown dissolved not that
inviolable friendship which they professed to their chieftain and to each other.
To die for the honour of their band was their chief ambition: To survive its
disgrace, or the death of their leader, was infamous. They even carried into the
field their women and children, who adopted all the martial sentiments of the
men: and being thus impelled by every human motive, they were invincible; where
they were not opposed, either by the similar manners and institutions of the
neighbouring Germans, or by the superior discipline, arms, and numbers of the
Romans[n27].

{#18} ^The^ leaders and their military companions were
maintained by the labour of their slaves, or by that of the weaker and less
warlike part of the community, whom they defended. The contributions, which they
levied, went not beyond a bare subsistence; and the honours, acquired by a
superior rank, were the only reward of their superior dangers and fatigues. All
the refined arts of life were unknown among the Germans: Tillage itself was
almost wholly neglected: They even seem to have been anxious to prevent any
improvements of that nature; and the leaders, by annually distributing anew all
the land among the inhabitants of each village, kept them from attaching
themselves to particular possessions, or making such progress in agriculture as
might divert their attention from military expeditions, the chief occupation of
the community[n28].

{#19} ^The^ Saxons had been for some time regarded as one of the
most warlike tribes of this fierce people, and had become the terror of the
neighbouring nations[n29]. They had diffused themselves from the northern parts
of Germany and the Cimbrian Chersonesus, and had taken possession of all the
sea-coast from the mouth of the Rhine to Jutland; whence they had long infested
by their pyracies all the eastern and southern parts of Britain, and the
northern of Gaul[n30]. In order to oppose their inroads, the Romans had
established an officer, whom they called _Count of the Saxon shore;_ and as the
naval arts can flourish among a civilized people alone, they |seem to have been
more successful in repelling the Saxons than any of the other barbarians, by
whom they were invaded. The dissolution of the Roman power invited them to renew
their inroads; and it was an acceptable circumstance, that the deputies of the
Britons appeared among them, and prompted them to undertake an enterprize, to
which they were of themselves sufficiently inclined[n31].

{#20} ^Hengist^ and Horsa, two brothers, possessed great credit
among the Saxons, and were much celebrated both for their valour and nobility.
They were reputed, as most of the Saxon princes, to be sprung from Woden, who
was worshipped as a god among those nations, and they are said to be his great
grandsons[n32]; a circumstance which added much to their authority. We shall not
attempt to trace any higher the origin of those princes and nations. It is
evident what fruitless labour it must be to search, in those barbarous and
illiterate ages, for the annals of a people, when their first leaders, known in
any true history, were believed by them to be the fourth in descent from a
fabulous deity, or from a man, exalted by ignorance into that character. The
dark industry of antiquaries, led by imaginary analogies of names, or by
uncertain traditions, would in vain attempt to pierce into that deep obscurity,
which covers the remote history of those nations.

{#21} ^These^ two brothers, observing the other provinces of
Germany to be occupied by a warlike and necessitous people, and the rich
provinces of Gaul already conquered or over-run by other German tribes, found it
easy to persuade their countrymen to embrace the sole enterprize, which promised
a favourable opportunity of displaying their valour and gratifying their
avidity. They embarked their troops in three vessels, and about the year 449 or
450[n33], carried over 1600 men, who landed in the isle of Thanet, and
immediately marched to the defence of the Britons against the northern invaders.
The Scots and Picts were unable to resist the valour of these auxiliaries; and
the Britons, applauding their own wisdom in calling over the Saxons, hoped
thenceforth to enjoy peace and security under the powerful protection of that
warlike people.

{#22} ^But^ Hengist and Horsa, perceiving, from their easy
victory over the Scots and Picts, with what facility they might subdue the
Britons themselves, who had not been able to resist those feeble invaders, were
determined to conquer and fight for their own grandeur, not for the defence of
their degenerate allies. They sent intelligence to Saxony of the fertility and
riches of Britain; and represented as certain the subjection of a people, so
long disused to arms, who, being now cut off from the Roman empire, of which
they had been a province during so many ages, had not yet acquired any union
among themselves, and were destitute of all affection to their new liberties,
and of all national attachments and regards[n34]. The vices and pusillanimity of
Vortigern, the British leader, were a new ground of hope; and the Saxons in
Germany, following such agreeable prospects, soon reinforced Hengist and Horsa
with 5000 men, who came over in seventeen vessels. The Britons now began to
entertain apprehensions of their allies, whose numbers they found continually
augmenting; but thought of no remedy, except a passive submission and
connivance. This weak expedient soon failed them. The Saxons sought a quarrel by
complaining, that their subsidies were ill paid, and their provisions
withdrawn[n35]: And immediately taking off the mask, they formed an alliance
with the Picts and Scots, and proceeded to open hostility against the Britons.

{#23} ^The^ Britons, impelled by these violent extremities, and
roused to indignation against their treacherous auxiliaries, were necessitated
to take arms; and having deposed Vortigern, who had become odious from his
vices, and from the bad event of his rash counsels, they put themselves under
the command of his son, Vortimer. They fought many battles with their enemies;
and though the victories in these actions be disputed between the British and
Saxon annalists, the progress still made by the Saxons prove that the advantage
was commonly on their side. In one battle, however, fought at Eglesford, now
Ailsford, Horsa, the Saxon general, was slain; and left the sole command over
his countrymen in the hands of Hengist. This active general, continually
reinforced by fresh numbers from Germany, carried devastation |into the most
remote corners of Britain; and being chiefly anxious to spread the terror of his
arms, he spared neither age, nor sex, nor condition, wherever he marched with
his victorious forces. The private and public edifices of the Britons were
reduced to ashes: The priests were slaughtered on the altars by those idolatrous
ravagers: The bishops and nobility shared the fate of the vulgar: The people,
flying to the mountains and deserts, were intercepted and butchered in heaps:
Some were glad to accept of life and servitude under their victors: Others,
deserting their native country, took shelter in the province of Armorica; where,
being charitably received by a people of the same language and manners, they
settled in great numbers, and gave the country the name of Brittany[n36].

{#24} ^The^ British writers assign one cause, which facilitated
the entrance of the Saxons into this island; the love, with which Vortigern was
at first seized for Rovena, the daughter of Hengist, and which that artful
warrior made use of to blind the eyes of the imprudent monarch[n37]. The same
historians add, that Vortimer died; and that Vortigern, being restored to the
throne, accepted of a banquet from Hengist, at Stonehenge; where 300 of his
nobility were treacherously slaughtered, and himself detained captive[n38]. But
these stories seem to have been invented by the Welsh authors, in order to
palliate the weak resistance made at first by their countrymen, and to account
for the rapid progress and licentious devastations of the Saxons[n39].

{#25} ^After^ the death of Vortimer, Ambrosius, a Briton, though
of Roman descent, was invested with the command over his countrymen, and
endeavoured, not without success, to unite them in their resistance against the
Saxons. Those contests encreased the animosity between the two nations, and
roused the military spirit of the ancient inhabitants, which had before been
sunk into a fatal lethargy. Hengist, however, notwithstanding their opposition,
still maintained his ground in Britain; and in order to divide the forces and
attention of the natives, he called over a new tribe of Saxons, under the
command of his brother Octa, and of Ebissa, the son of Octa; and he settled them
in Northumberland. He himself remained |in the southern parts of the island, and
laid the foundation of the kingdom of Kent, comprehending the county of that
name, Middlesex, Essex, and part of Surrey. He fixed his royal seat at
Canterbury; where he governed about forty years, and he died in or near the year
488; leaving his new-acquired dominions to his posterity.

{#26} ^The^ success of Hengist excited the avidity of the other
northern Germans; and at different times, and under different leaders, they
flocked over in multitudes to the invasion of this island. These conquerors were
chiefly composed of three tribes, the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes[n40], who all
passed under the common appellation, sometimes of Saxons, sometimes of Angles;
and speaking the same language, and being governed by the same institutions,
they were naturally led, from these causes, as well as from their common
interest, to unite themselves against the ancient inhabitants. The resistance
however, though unequal, was still maintained by the Britons: but became every
day more feeble: and their calamities admitted of few intervals, till they were
driven into Cornwal and Wales, and received protection from the remote situation
or inaccessible mountains of those countries.

{#27} ^The^ first Saxon state, after that of Kent, which was
established in Britain, was the kingdom of South-Saxony. In the year 477[n41],
{AE}lla, a Saxon chief, brought over an army from Germany; and landing on the
southern coast, proceeded to take possession of the neighbouring territory. The
Britons, now armed, did not tamely abandon their possessions; nor were they
expelled, till defeated in many battles by their warlike invaders. The most
memorable action, mentioned by historians, is that of Mearcredes-Burn[n42];
where, though the Saxons seem to have obtained the victory, they suffered so
considerable a loss, as somewhat retarded the progress of their conquests. But
{AE}lla, reinforced by fresh numbers of his countrymen, again took the field
against the Britons; and laid |siege to Andred-Ceaster, which was defended by
the garrison and inhabitants with desperate valour[n43]. The Saxons, enraged by
this resistance, and by the fatigues and dangers which they had sustained,
redoubled their efforts against the place, and when masters of it, put all their
enemies to the sword without distinction. This decisive advantage secured the
conquests of {AE}lla, who assumed the name of King, and extended his dominion
over Sussex and a great part of Surrey. He was stopped in his progress to the
east by the kingdom of Kent: In that to the west by another tribe of Saxons, who
had taken possession of that territory.

{#28} ^These^ Saxons, from the situation of the country, in
which they settled, were called the West-Saxons, and landed in the year 495,
under the command of Cerdic, and of his son Kenric[n44]. The Britons were, by
past experience, so much on their guard, and so well prepared to receive the
enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the very day of his landing; and though
vanquished, still defended, for some time, their liberties against the invaders.
None of the other tribes of Saxons met with such vigorous resistance, or exerted
such valour and perseverance in pushing their conquests. Cerdic was even obliged
to call for the assistance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of Kent and
Sussex, as well as from Germany, and he was thence joined by a fresh army under
the command of Porte, and of his sons Bleda and Megla[n45]. Strengthened by
these succours, he fought, in the year 508, a desperate battle with the Britons,
commanded by Nazan-Leod, who was victorious in the beginning of the action, and
routed the wing in which Cerdic himself commanded. But Kenric, who had prevailed
in the other wing, brought timely assistance to his father, and restored the
battle, which ended in a complete victory gained by the Saxons[n46]. Nazan-Leod
perished, with 5000 of his army: But left the Britons more weakened than
discouraged by his death. The war still continued, though the success was
commonly on the side of the Saxons, whose short swords and close manner of
fighting gave them great advantage over the missile weapons of the Britons.
Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune; and in order to extend his
conquests, he |laid siege to Mount Badon or Banesdowne near Bath, whither the
most obstinate of the discomfited Britons had retired. The southern Britons in
this extremity applied for assistance to Arthur, Prince of the Silures, whose
heroic valour now sustained the declining fate of this country[n47]. This is
that Arthur so much celebrated in the songs of Thaliessin, and the other British
bards, and whose military atchievements have been blended with so many fables as
even to give occasion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence. But poets,
though they disfigure the most certain history by their fictions, and use
strange liberties with truth where they are the sole historians, as among the
Britons, have commonly some foundation for their wildest exaggerations. Certain
it is, that the siege of Badon was raised by the Britons in the year 520; and
the Saxons were there discomfited in a great battle[n48]. This misfortune
stopped the progress of Cerdic; but was not sufficient to wrest from him the
conquests, which he had already made. He and his son, Kenric, who succeeded him,
established the kingdom of the West-Saxons or of Wessex, over the counties of
Hants, Dorset, Wilts, Berks, and the Isle of Wight, and left their new-acquired
dominions to their posterity. Cerdic died in 534, Kenric in 560.

{#29} ^While^ the Saxons made this progress in the south, their
countrymen were not less active in other quarters. In the year 527, a great
tribe of adventurers, under several leaders, landed on the east-coast of
Britain; and after fighting many battles, of which history has preserved no
particular account, they established three new kingdoms in this island. Uffa
assumed the title of king of the East-Angles in 575; Crida that of Mercia in
585[n49]; and Erkenwin that of East-Saxony or Essex nearly about the same time;
but the year is uncertain. This latter kingdom was dismembered from that of
Kent, and comprehended Essex, Middlesex, and part of Hertfordshire. That of the
East-Angles, the counties of Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk: Mercia was
extended over all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the
frontiers of these two kingdoms.

{#30} ^The^ Saxons, soon after the landing of Hengist, had been
planted in Northumberland; but as they met with an obstinate |resistance, and
made but small progress in subduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in so
unsettled a condition, that none of their princes for a long time assumed the
appellation of king. At last in 547[n50], Ida, a Saxon prince of great
valour[n51], who claimed a descent, as did all the other princes of that nation,
from Woden, brought over a reinforcement from Germany, and enabled the
Northumbrians to carry on their conquests over the Britons. He entirely subdued
the county now called Northumberland, the bishopric of Durham, as well as some
of the south-east counties of Scotland; and he assumed the crown under the title
of king of Bernicia. Nearly about the same time, {AE}lla, another Saxon prince,
having conquered Lancashire, and the greater part of Yorkshire, received the
appellation of king of Deiri[n52]. These two kingdoms were united in the person
of Ethelfrid, grandson of Ida, who married Acca, the daughter of {AE}lla; and
expelling her brother, Edwin, established one of the most powerful of the Saxon
kingdoms, by the title of Northumberland. How far his dominions extended into
the country now called Scotland is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that all
the lowlands, especially the east-coast of that country, were peopled in a great
measure from Germany; though the expeditions, made by the several Saxon
adventurers, have escaped the records of history. The language, spoken in those
countries, which is purely Saxon, is a stronger proof of this event, than can be
opposed by the imperfect, or rather fabulous annals, which are obtruded on us by
the Scottish historians.

{#31} THUS was established, after a violent contest of near a
hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or seven Saxon kingdoms, in Britain; and
the whole southern part of the island, except Wales and Cornwal, had totally
changed its inhabitants, language, customs, and political institutions. The
Britons, under the Roman dominion, had made such advances towards arts and civil
manners, that they had built twenty-eight considerable cities |within their
province, besides a great number of villages and country-seats[n53]: But the
fierce conquerors, by whom they were now subdued, threw every thing back into
ancient barbarity; and those few natives, who were not either massacred or
expelled their habitations, were reduced to the most abject slavery. None of the
other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or Burgundians, though
they over-ran the southern provinces of the empire like a mighty torrent, made
such devastations in the conquered territories, or were inflamed into so violent
an animosity against the ancient inhabitants. As the Saxons came over at
intervals in separate bodies, the Britons, however at first unwarlike, were
tempted to make resistance; and hostilities, being thereby prolonged, proved
more destructive to both parties, especially to the vanquished. The first
invaders from Germany, instead of excluding other adventurers, who must share
with them the spoils of the ancient inhabitants, were obliged to solicit fresh
supplies from their own country; and a total extermination of the Britons became
the sole expedient for providing a settlement and subsistence to the new
planters. Hence there have been found in history few conquests more ruinous than
that of the Saxons; and few revolutions more violent than that which they
introduced.

{#32} ^So^ long as the contest was maintained with the natives,
the several Saxon princes preserved a union of counsels and interests; but after
the Britons were shut up in the barren countries of Cornwal and Wales, and gave
no farther disturbance to the conquerors, the band of alliance was in a great
measure dissolved among the princes of the Heptarchy. Though one prince seems
still to have been allowed, or to have assumed, an ascendant over the whole, his
authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or legal, was extremely
limited; and each state acted as if it had been independant, and wholly separate
from the rest. Wars, therefore, and revolutions and dissensions were unavoidable
among a turbulent and military people; and these events, however intricate or
confused, ought now to become the objects of our attention. But, added to the
difficulty of carrying on at once the history of seven independant kingdoms,
there is great discouragement to a writer, arising from the uncertainty, at
least barrenness, of the accounts |transmitted to us. The Monks, who were the
only annalists during those ages, lived remote from public affairs, considered
the civil transactions as entirely subordinate to the ecclesiastical, and
besides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity, which were then universal,
were strongly infected with credulity, with the love of wonder, and with a
propensity to imposture; vices almost inseparable from their profession, and
manner of life. The history of that period abounds in names, but is extremely
barren of events; or the events are related so much without circumstances and
causes, that the most profound or most eloquent writer must despair of rendering
them either instructive or entertaining to the reader. Even the great learning
and vigorous imagination of Milton sunk under the weight; and this author
scruples not to declare, that the skirmishes of kites or crows as much merited a
particular narrative, as the confused transactions and battles of the Saxon
Heptarchy[n54]. In order, however, to connect the events in some tolerable
measure, we shall give a succinct account of the successions of kings, and of
the more remarkable revolutions in each particular kingdom; beginning with that
of Kent, which was the first established.

{#33} ESCUS succeeded his father, Hengist, in the kingdom of
Kent; but seems not to have possessed the military genius of that conqueror, who
first made way for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the Saxons,
who sought either the fame of valour, or new establishments by arms, flocked to
the standard of {AE}lla, king of Sussex, who was carrying on successful war
against the Britons, and laying the foundations of a new kingdom. Escus was
content to possess in tranquillity the kingdom of Kent, which he left in 512 to
his son Octa, in whose time the East-Saxons established their monarchy, and
dismembered the provinces of Essex and Middlesex from that of Kent. His death,
after a reign of twenty-two years, made room for his son Hermenric in 534, who
performed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty-two |years; except
associating with him his son, Ethelbert, in the government, that he might secure
the succession in his family, and prevent such revolutions as are incident to a
turbulent and barbarous monarchy.

{#34} ^Ethelbert^ revived the reputation of his family, which
had languished for some generations. The inactivity of his predecessors, and the
situation of his country, secured from all hostility with the Britons, seem to
have much enfeebled the warlike genius of the Kentish Saxons; and Ethelbert, in
his first attempt to aggrandize his country, and distinguish his own name, was
unsuccessful[n55]. He was twice discomfited in battle by Ceaulin, king of
Wessex; and obliged to yield the superiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious
monarch, who preserved no moderation in his victory, and by reducing the kingdom
of Sussex to subjection, excited jealousy in all the other princes. An
association was formed against him; and Ethelbert, intrusted with the command of
the allies, gave him battle, and obtained a decisive victory[n56]. Ceaulin died
soon after; and Ethelbert succeeded as well to his ascendant among the Saxon
states, as to his other ambitious projects. He reduced all the princes, except
the king of Northumberland, to a strict dependance upon him; and even
established himself by force on the throne of Mercia, the most extensive of the
Saxon kingdoms. Apprehensive, however, of a dangerous league against him, like
that by which he himself had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the
prudence to resign the kingdom of Mercia to Webba, the rightful heir, the son of
Crida, who had first founded that monarchy. But governed still by ambition more
than by justice, he gave Webba possession of the crown on such conditions, as
rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor.

{#35} ^But^ the most memorable event, which distinguished the
reign of this great prince, was the introduction of the Christian religion among
the English Saxons. The superstition of the Germans, particularly that of the
Saxons, was of the grossest and most barbarous kind; and being founded on
traditional tales, received from their ancestors, not reduced to any system, not
supported by political institutions, like that of the Druids, it seems to have
made little impression on its votaries, and to have easily resigned its place to
|the new doctrine, promulgated to them. Woden, whom they deemed the ancestor of
all their princes, was regarded as the god of war, and, by a natural
consequence, became their supreme deity, and the chief object of their religious
worship. They believed, that, if they obtained the favour of this divinity by
their valour, (for they made less account of the other virtues) they should be
admitted after their death into his hall; and reposing on couches, should
satiate themselves with ale from the skulls of their enemies, whom they had
slain in battle. Incited by this idea of paradise, which gratified at once the
passion of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling inclinations of
barbarians, they despised the dangers of war, and encreased their native
ferocity against the vanquished by their religious prejudices. We know little of
the other theological tenets of the Saxons: We only learn that they were
polytheists; that they worshipped the sun and moon; that they adored the god of
thunder, under the name of Thor; that they had images in their temples; that
they practised sacrifices; believed firmly in spells and inchantments, and
admitted in general a system of doctrines, which they held as sacred, but which,
like all other superstitions, must carry the air of the wildest extravagance, if
propounded to those who are not familiarized to it from their earliest infancy.

{#36} ^The^ constant hostilities, which the Saxons maintained
against the Britons, would naturally indispose them for receiving the Christian
faith, when preached to them by such inveterate enemies; and perhaps the
Britons, as is objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not overfond of
communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life and
salvation. But as a civilized people, however subdued by arms, still maintain a
sensible superiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all the other northern
conquerors of Europe had been already induced to embrace the Christian faith,
which they found established in the empire; and it was impossible but the Saxons
informed of this event, must have regarded with some degree of veneration a
doctrine, which had acquired the ascendant over all their brethren. However
limited in their views, they could not but have perceived a degree of
cultivation in the southern countries beyond what they themselves possessed; and
it was natural for them to yield to that superior knowledge, as well as zeal, by
which the inhabitants of the Christian kingdoms were even at that time
distinguished.

{#37} ^But^ these causes might long have failed of producing any
considerable effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the means of
introducing Christianity into Kent. Ethelbert, in his father's lifetime, had
married Bertha, the only daughter of Carlbert, king of Paris[n57], one of the
descendants of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul; but before he was admitted to this
alliance, he was obliged to stipulate, that the princess should enjoy the free
exercise of her religion; a concession not difficult to be obtained from the
idolatrous Saxons[n58]. Bertha brought over a French bishop to the court of
Canterbury; and being zealous for the propagation of her religion, she had been
very assiduous in her devotional exercises, had supported the credit of her
faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had employed every art of insinuation
and address to reconcile her husband to her religious principles. Her popularity
in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert, had so well paved the way for
the reception of the Christian doctrine, that Gregory, sirnamed the Great, then
Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of effecting a project which he himself,
before he mounted the papal throne, had once embraced, of converting the British
Saxons.

{#38} ^It^ happened, that this prelate, at that time in a
private station, had observed in the market-place of Rome some Saxon youth
exposed to sale, whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain,
had bought of their mercenary parents. Struck with the beauty of their fair
complexions and blooming countenances, Gregory asked to what country they
belonged; and being told they were _Angles,_ he replied, that they ought more
properly to be denominated _angels:_ It were a pity that the Prince of Darkness
should enjoy so fair a prey, and that so beautiful a frontispiece should cover a
mind destitute of internal grace and righteousness. Enquiring farther concerning
the name of their province, he was informed, that it was Deïri, a district of
Northumberland: _Deïri!_ replied he, _that is good! They are called to the mercy
of God from his anger,_ De ira. _But what is the name of the king of that
province?_ He was told it was _{AE}lla_ or _Alla Alleluiah,_ cried he: _We must
endeavour, that the praises of God be sung in their country._ Moved by these
allusions, which appeared to him so happy, he determined to undertake, |himself,
a mission into Britain; and having obtained the Pope's approbation, he prepared
for that perilous journey: But his popularity at home was so great, that the
Romans, unwilling to expose him to such dangers, opposed his design; and he was
obliged for the present to lay aside all farther thoughts of executing that
pious purpose[n59].

{#39} ^The^ controversy between the Pagans and the Christians
was not entirely cooled in that age; and no pontiff before Gregory had ever
carried to greater excess an intemperate zeal against the former religion. He
had waged war with all the precious monuments of the ancients, and even with
their writings; which, as appears from the strain of his own wit, as well as
from the style of his compositions, he had not taste or genius sufficient to
comprehend. Ambitious to distinguish his pontificate by the conversion of the
British Saxons, he pitched on Augustine, a Roman monk, and sent him with forty
associates to preach the gospel in this island. These missionaries, terrified
with the dangers which might attend their proposing a new doctrine to so fierce
a people, of whose language they were ignorant, stopped some time in France, and
sent back Augustine to lay the hazards and difficulties before the Pope, and
crave his permission to desist from the undertaking. But Gregory exhorted them
to persevere in their purpose, advised them to chuse some interpreters from
among the Franks, who still spoke the same language with the Saxons[n60], and
recommended them to the good offices of queen Brunehaut, who had at this time
usurped the sovereign power in France. This princess, though stained with every
vice of treachery and cruelty, either possessed or pretended great zeal for the
cause; and Gregory acknowledged, that to her friendly assistance was, in a great
measure, owing the success of that undertaking[n61].

{#40} ^Augustine^, on his arrival in Kent in the year 597[n62],
found the danger much less than he had apprehended. Ethelbert, already
well-disposed towards the Christian faith, assigned him a habitation in the Isle
of Thanet; and soon after admitted him to a conference. Apprehensive, however,
lest spells or enchantments might be employed against him by priests, who
brought an unknown worship from a distant country, he had the precaution to
|receive them in the open air, where, he believed the force of their magic would
be more easily dissipated[n63]. Here Augustine, by means of his interpreters,
delivered to him the tenets of the Christian faith, and promised him eternal
joys above, and a kingdom in heaven without end, if he would be persuaded to
receive that salutary doctrine. "Your words and promises," replied
Ethelbert[n64], "are fair; but because they are new and uncertain, I cannot
entirely yield to them, and relinquish the principles, which I and my ancestors
have so long maintained. You are welcome, however, to remain here in peace; and
as you have undertaken so long a journey, solely, as it appears, for what you
believe to be for our advantage, I will supply you with all necessaries, and
permit you to deliver your doctrine to my subjects."[n65]

{#41} ^Augustine^, encouraged by this favourable reception, and
seeing now a prospect of success, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the
gospel to the Kentish Saxons. He attracted their attention by the austerity of
his manners, by the severe pennances to which he subjected himself, by the
abstinence and self-denial which he practised: And having excited their wonder
by a course of life, which appeared so contrary to nature, he procured more
easily their belief of miracles, which, it was pretended, he wrought for their
conversion[n66]. Influenced by these motives, and by the declared favour of the
court, numbers of the Kentish men were baptized; and the king himself was
persuaded to submit to that rite of Christianity. His example had great
influence with his subjects; but he employed no force to bring them over to the
new doctrine. Augustine thought proper, in the commencement of his mission, to
assume the appearance of the greatest lenity: He told Ethelbert, that the
service of Christ must be entirely voluntary, and that no violence ought ever to
be used in propagating so salutary a doctrine[n67].

{#42} ^The^ intelligence, received of these spiritual conquests,
afforded great joy to the Romans; who now exulted as much in those peaceful
trophies, as their ancestors had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs,
and most splendid victories. Gregory wrote |a letter to Ethelbert, in which,
after informing him that the end of the world was approaching, he exhorted him
to display his zeal in the conversion of his subjects, to exert rigour against
the worship of idols, and to build up the good work of holiness by every
expedient of exhortation, terror, blandishment, or correction[n68]: A doctrine
more suitable to that age, and to the usual papal maxims, than the tolerating
principles, which Augustine had thought it prudent to inculcate. The pontiff
also answered some questions, which the missionary had put concerning the
government of the new church of Kent. Besides other queries, which it is not
material here to relate, Augustine asked_, Whether cousin-germans might be
allowed to marry?_ Gregory answered, that that liberty had indeed been formerly
granted by the Roman law; but that experience had shewn, that no issue could
ever come from such marriages; and he therefore prohibited them. Augustine
asked, _Whether a woman pregnant might be baptized?_ Gregory answered, that he
saw no objection. _How soon after the birth the child might receive baptism?_ It
was answered, Immediately, if necessary. _How soon a husband might have commerce
with his wife after her delivery?_ Not till she had given suck to her child: a
practice to which Gregory exhorts all women. _How soon a man_ _might enter the
church, or receive the sacrament, after having had commerce with his wife?_ It
was replied, that, unless he had approached her without desire, merely for the
sake of propagating his species, he was not without sin: But in all cases it was
requisite for him, before he entered the church, or communicated, to purge
himself by prayer and ablution; and he ought not, even after using these
precautions, to participate immediately of the sacred duties[n69]. There are
some other questions and replies still more indecent and more ridiculous[n70].
And on the whole it appears, that Gregory and his missionary, if sympathy of
manners have any influence, were |better calculated than men of more refined
understandings, for making a progress with the ignorant and barbarous Saxons.

{#43} ^The^ more to facilitate the reception of Christianity,
Gregory enjoined Augustine to remove the idols from the Heathen altars, but not
to destroy the altars themselves; because the people, he said, would be allured
to frequent the Christian worship, when they found it celebrated in a place,
which they were accustomed to revere. And as the Pagans practised sacrifices,
and feasted with the priests on their offerings, he also exhorted the missionary
to persuade them, on Christian festivals, to kill their cattle in the
neighbourhood of the church, and to indulge themselves in those cheerful
entertainments, to which they had been habituated[n71]. These political
compliances shew, that, notwithstanding his ignorance and prejudices, he was not
unacquainted with the arts of governing mankind. Augustine was consecrated
archbishop of Canterbury, was endowed by Gregory with authority over all the
British churches, and received the pall, a badge of ecclesiastical honour, from
Rome[n72]. Gregory also advised him not to be too much elated with his gift of
working miracles[n73]; and as Augustine, proud of the success of his mission,
seemed to think himself entitled to extend his authority over the bishops of
Gaul, the Pope informed him, that they lay entirely without the bounds of his
jurisdiction[n74].

{#44} ^The^ marriage of Ethelbert with Bertha, and much more his
embracing Christianity, begat a connexion of his subjects with the French,
Italians, and other nations on the continent, and tended to reclaim them from
that gross ignorance and barbarity, in which all the Saxon tribes had been
hitherto involved[n75]. Ethelbert also enacted[n76], with the consent of the
states of his kingdom, a body of laws, the first written laws promulgated by any
of the northern conquerors; and his reign was in every respect glorious to
himself, and beneficial to his people. He governed the kingdom of Kent fifty
years; and dying in 616, left the succession to his son, Eadbald. This prince,
seduced by a passion for his mother-in-law, deserted for some time the Christian
faith, which permitted not these incestuous marriages: His whole people
immediately returned with him |to idolatry. Laurentius, the successor of
Augustine, found the Christian worship wholly abandoned, and was prepared to
return to France, in order to escape the mortification of preaching the gospel
without fruit to the infidels. Mellitus and Justus, who had been consecrated
bishops of London and Rochester, had already departed the kingdom[n77]; when
Laurentius, before he should entirely abandon his dignity, made one effort to
reclaim the king. He appeared before that prince; and throwing off his
vestments, showed his body all torn with bruises and stripes, which he had
received. Eadbald, wondering that any man should have dared to treat in that
manner a person of his rank, was told by Laurentius, that he had received this
chastisement from St. Peter, the prince of the apostles, who had appeared to him
in a vision, and severely reproving him for his intention to desert his charge,
had inflicted on him these visible marks of his displeasure[n78]. Whether
Eadbald was struck with the miracle, or influenced by some other motive, he
divorced himself from his mother-in-law, and returned to the profession of
Christianity[n79]: His whole people returned with him. Eadbald reached not the
fame or authority of his father, and died in 640, after a reign of twenty-five
years; leaving two sons, Erminfrid and Ercombert.

{#45} ^Ercombert^, though the younger son, by Emma, a French
princess, found means to mount the throne. He is celebrated by Bede for two
exploits, for establishing the fast of Lent in his kingdom, and for utterly
extirpating idolatry; which, notwithstanding the prevalence of Christianity, had
hitherto been tolerated by the two preceding monarchs. He reigned twenty-four
years; and left the crown to Egbert, his son, who reigned nine years. This
prince is renowned for his encouragement of learning; but infamous for putting
to death his two cousin-germans, sons of Erminfrid, his uncle. The
ecclesiastical writers praise him for his bestowing on' his sister, Domnona,
some lands in the Isle of Thanet, where she founded a monastery.

{#46} ^The^ bloody precaution of Egbert could not fix the crown
on the head of his son, Edric. Lothaire, brother of the deceased prince, took
possession of the kingdom; and, in order to secure the power |in his family, he
associated with him Richard, his son, in the administration of the government.
Edric, the dispossessed prince, had recourse to Edilwach, king of Sussex, for
assistance; and being supported by that prince, fought a battle with his uncle,
who was defeated and slain. Richard fled into Germany, and afterwards died in
Lucca, a city of Tuscany. William of Malmesbury ascribes Lothaire's bad fortune
to two crimes, his concurrence in the murder of his cousins, and his contempt
for reliques[n80].

{#47} ^Lothaire^ reigned eleven years; Edric, his successor,
only two. Upon the death of the latter, which happened in 686, Widred, his
brother, obtained possession of the crown. But as the succession had been of
late so much disjointed by revolutions and usurpations, faction began to prevail
among the nobility; which invited Cedwalla, king of Wessex, with his brother
Mollo, to attack the kingdom. These invaders committed great devastations in
Kent; but the death of Mollo, who was slain in a skirmish[n81], gave a short
breathing-time to that kingdom. Widred restored the affairs of Kent; and after a
reign of thirty-two years[n82], left the crown to his posterity. Eadbert,
Ethelbert, and Alric, his descendants, successively mounted the throne. After
the death of the last, which happened in 794, the royal family of Kent was
extinguished; and every factious leader who could entertain hopes of ascending
the throne, threw the state into confusion[n83]. Egbert, who first succeeded,
reigned but two years; Cuthred, brother to the King of Mercia, six years;
Baldred, an illegitimate branch of the royal family, eighteen: And after a
troublesome and precarious reign, he was, in the year 723, expelled by Egbert,
king of Wessex, who dissolved the Saxon Heptarchy, and united the several
kingdoms under his dominion.

{#48} AD^elfrid^, king of Bernicia, having married Acca, the
daughter of {AE}lla, king of Deïri, and expelled her infant brother, Edwin, had
united all the counties north of Humber into |one monarchy, and acquired a great
ascendant in the Heptarchy. He also spread the terror of the Saxon arms to the
neighbouring people; and by his victories over the Scots and Picts, as well as
Welsh, extended on all sides the bounds of his dominions. Having laid siege to
Chester, the Britons marched out with all their forces to engage him; and they
were attended by a body of 1250 monks from the monastery of Bangor, who stood at
a small distance from the field of battle, in order to encourage the combatants
by their presence and exhortations. Adelfrid enquiring the purpose of this
unusual appearance, was told, that these priests had come to pray against him:
_Then are they as such our enemies,_ said he, _as those who intend to fight
against us[n84]:_ And he immediately sent a detachment, who fell upon them, and
did such execution, that only fifty escaped with their lives[n85]. The Britons,
astonished at this event, received a total defeat: Chester was obliged to
surrender: and Adelfrid, pursuing his victory, made himself master of Bangor,
and entirely demolished the monastery; a building so extensive, that there was a
mile's distance from one gate of it to another; and it contained two thousand
one hundred monks, who are said to have been there maintained by their own
labour[n86].

{#49} ^Notwithstanding^ Adelfrid's success in war, he lived in
inquietude on account of young Edwin, whom he had unjustly dispossessed of the
crown of Deïri. This prince, now grown to man's estate, wandered from place to
place, in continual danger from the attempts of Adelfrid; and received at last
protection in the court of Redwald, king of the East-Angles; where his engaging
and gallant deportment procured him general esteem and affection. Redwald,
however, was strongly solicited by the king of Northumberland to kill or deliver
up his guest: Rich presents were promised him, if he would comply; and war
denounced against him in case of his refusal. After rejecting several messages
of this kind, his generosity began to yield to the motives of interest: and he
retained the last ambassador, till he should come to a resolution in a case of
such importance. Edwin, informed of his friend's perplexity, was yet determined
at all hazards to remain in East-Anglia; and thought, that if the protection of
that court failed him, it were better to die than prolong a life so much exposed
to the persecutions of his |powerful rival. This confidence in Redwald's honour
and friendship, with his other accomplishments, engaged the Queen on his side;
and she effectually represented to her husband the infamy of delivering up to
certain destruction their royal guest, who had fled to them for protection
against his cruel and jealous enemies[n87]. Redwald, embracing more generous
resolutions, thought it safest to prevent Adelfrid, before that prince was aware
of his intention, and to attack him while he was yet unprepared for defence. He
marched suddenly with an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and sought a
battle with Adelfrid; in which that monarch was defeated and killed, after
revenging himself by the death of Regner, son of Redwald[n88]. His own sons,
Eanfrid, Oswald, and Oswy, yet infants, were carried into Scotland; and Edwin
obtained possession of the crown of Northumberland.

{#50} ^Edwin^ was the greatest prince of the Heptarchy in that
age, and distinguished himself, both by his influence over the other
kingdoms[n89], and by the strict execution of justice in his own dominions. He
reclaimed his subjects from the licentious life, to which they had been
accustomed; and it was a common saying, that during his reign a woman or child
might openly carry every where a purse of gold, without any danger of violence
or robbery. There is a remarkable instance, transmitted to us, of the affection
borne him by his servants. Cuichelme, king of Wessex, was his enemy; but finding
himself unable to maintain open war against so gallant and powerful a prince, he
determined to use treachery against him, and he employed one Eumer for that
criminal purpose. The assassin, having obtained admittance, by pretending to
deliver a message from Cuichelme, drew his dagger, and rushed upon the King.
Lilla, an officer of his army, seeing his master's danger, and having no other
means of defence, interposed with his own body between the King and Eumer's
dagger, which was pushed with such violence, that, after piercing Lilla, it even
wounded Edwin: But before the assassin could renew his blow, he was dispatched
by the King's attendants.

{#51} ^The^ East-Angles conspired against Redwald, their King;
and having put him to death, they offered their crown to Edwin, of whose valour
and capacity they had had experience, while he resided |among them. But Edwin,
from a sense of gratitude towards his benefactor, obliged them to submit to
Earpwold, the son of Redwald; and that prince preserved his authority, though on
a precarious footing, under the protection of the Northumbrian monarch [n90].

{#52} ^Edwin^, after his accession to the crown, married
Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert, King of Kent. This princess, emulating
the glory of her mother Bertha, who had been the instrument for converting her
husband and his people to Christianity, carried Paullinus, a learned bishop,
along with her[n91]; and besides stipulating a toleration for the exercise of
her own religion, which was readily granted her, she used every reason to
persuade the King to embrace it. Edwin, like a prudent prince, hesitated on the
proposal; but promised to examine the foundations of that doctrine; and
declared, that, if he found them satisfactory, he was willing to be
converted[n92]. Accordingly he held several conferences with Paullinus;
canvassed the arguments propounded with the wisest of his counsellors; retired
frequently from company, in order to revolve alone that important question; and,
after a serious and long enquiry, declared in favour of the Christian
religion[n93]: The people soon after imitated his example. Besides the authority
and influence of the King, they were moved by another striking example. Coifi,
the high priest, being converted after a public conference with Paullinus, led
the way in destroying the images, which he had so long worshipped, and was
forward in making this atonement for his past idolatry[n94].

{#53} ^This^ able prince perished with his son, Osfrid, in a
great battle which he fought against Penda, king of Mercia, and Caedwalla, king
of the Britons[n95]. That event, which happened in the forty-eighth year of
Edwin's age and seventeenth of his reign[n96], divided the monarchy of
Northumberland, which that prince had united in his person. Eanfrid, the son of
Adelfrid, returned with his brothers, Oswald and Oswy, from Scotland, and took
possession of Bernicia, his paternal kingdom: Osric, Edwin's cousin-german,
established himself in Deïri, the inheritance of his family; but to |which the
sons of Edwin had a preferable title. Eanfrid, the elder surviving son, fled to
Penda, by whom he was treacherously slain. The younger son, Vuscfraea, with
Yffi, the grandson of Edwin, by Osfrid, sought protection in Kent, and not
finding themselves in safety there, retired into France to King Dagobert, where
they died[n97].

{#54} ^Osric^, King of Deïri, and Eanfrid of Bernicia, returned
to Paganism; and the whole people seem to have returned with them; since
Paullinus, who was the first archbishop of York, and who had converted them,
thought proper to retire with Ethelburga, the Queen Dowager, into Kent. Both
these Northumbrian kings perished soon after, the first in battle against
Caedwalla, the Briton; the second by the treachery of that prince. Oswald, the
brother of Eanfrid, of the race of Bernicia, united again the kingdom of
Northumberland in the year 634, and restored the Christian religion in his
dominions. He gained a bloody and well-disputed battle against Caedwalla; the
last vigorous effort which the Britons made against the Saxons. Oswald is much
celebrated for his sanctity and charity by the Monkish historians; and they
pretend, that his reliques wrought miracles, particularly the curing of a sick
horse, which had approached the place of his interment[n98].

{#55} ^He^ died in battle against Penda, king of Mercia, and was
succeeded by his brother, Oswy; who established himself in the government of the
whole Northumbrian kingdom, by putting to death Oswin, the son of Osric, the
last king of the race of Deïri. His son Egfrid succeeded him; who perishing in
battle against the Picts, without leaving any children, because Adelthrid, his
wife, refused to violate her vow of chastity, Alfred, his natural brother,
acquired possession of the kingdom, which he governed for nineteen years; and he
left it to Osred, his son, a boy of eight years of age. This prince, after a
reign of eleven years, was murdered by Kenred his kinsman, who, after enjoying
the crown only a year, perished by a like fate. Osric, and after him Celwulph
the son of Kenred, next mounted the throne, which the latter relinquished in the
year 738, in favour of Eadbert his cousin-german, who, imitating his
predecessor, abdicated the crown, and retired into a monastery. Oswolf, son of
Eadbert, was slain in a sedition, a year after his accession to the |crown; and
Mollo, who was not of the royal family, seized the crown. He perished by the
treachery of Ailred, a prince of the blood; and Ailred, having succeeded in his
design upon the throne, was soon after expelled by his subjects. Ethelred, his
successor, the son of Mollo, underwent a like fate. Celwold, the next king, the
brother of Ailred, was deposed and slain by the people, and his place was filled
by Osred, his nephew, who, after a short reign of a year, made way for
Ethelbert, another son of Mollo, whose death was equally tragical with that of
almost all his predecessors. After Ethelbert's death an universal anarchy
prevailed in Northumberland; and the people, having, by so many fatal
revolutions, lost all attachment to their government and princes, were well
prepared for subjection to a foreign yoke; which Egbert, king of Wessex, finally
imposed upon them.

{#56} THE history of this kingdom contains nothing memorable,
except the conversion of Earpwold, the fourth king, and great-grandson of Uffa,
the founder of the monarchy. The authority of Edwin, king of Northumberland, on
whom that prince entirely depended, engaged him to take this step: But soon
after, his wife, who was an idolatress, brought him back to her religion; and he
was found unable to resist those allurements, which have seduced the wisest of
mankind. After his death, which was violent, like that of most of the Saxon
princes, that did not early retire into monasteries, Sigebert, his successor,
and half-brother, who had been educated in France, restored Christianity, and
introduced learning among the East-Angles. Some pretend that he founded the
university of Cambridge, or rather some schools in that place. It is almost
impossible, and quite needless to be more particular in relating the
transactions of the East-Angles. What instruction or entertainment can it give
the reader to hear a long bead-roll of barbarous names, Egric, Annas, Ethelbert,
Ethelwald, Aldulf, Elfwald, Beorne, Ethelred, Ethelbert, who successively
murdered, expelled, or inherited from each other, and obscurely filled the
|throne of that kingdom. Ethelbert, the last of these princes was treacherously
murdered by Offa, king of Mercia, in the year 792, and his state was thenceforth
united with that of Offa, as we shall relate presently.

{#57} MERCIA, the largest, if not the most powerful kingdom of
the Heptarchy, comprehended all the middle counties of England; and as its
frontiers extended to those of all the other six kingdoms, as well as to Wales,
it received its name from that circumstance. Wibba, the son of Crida, founder of
the monarchy, being placed on the throne by Ethelbert, king of Kent, governed
his paternal dominions by a precarious authority; and after his death, Ceorl,
his kinsman, was, by the influence of the Kentish monarch, preferred to his son,
Penda, whose turbulent character appeared dangerous to that prince. Penda was
thus fifty years of age before he mounted the throne; and his temerity and
restless disposition were found nowise abated by time, experience, or
reflection. He engaged in continual hostilities against all the neighbouring
states; and, by his injustice and violence, rendered himself equally odious to
his own subjects and to strangers. Sigebert, Egric, and Annas, three kings of
East-Anglia, perished successively in battle against him; as did also Edwin and
Oswald, the two greatest princes that had reigned over Northumberland. At last,
Oswy, brother to Oswald, having defeated and slain him in a decisive battle,
freed the world from this sanguinary tyrant. Peada, his son, mounted the throne
of Mercia in 655, and lived under the protection of Oswy, whose daughter he had
espoused. This princess was educated in the Christian faith, and she employed
her influence with success, in converting her husband and his subjects to that
religion. Thus the fair sex have had the merit of introducing the Christian
doctrine into all the most considerable kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy. Peada
died a violent death[n99]. His son, Wolfhere, |succeeded to the government; and
after having reduced to dependance the kingdoms of Essex and East-Anglia, he
left the crown to his brother, Ethelred, who, though a lover of peace, showed
himself not unfit for military enterprizes. Besides making a successful
expedition into Kent, he repulsed Egfrid, king of Northumberland, who had
invaded his dominions; and he slew in battle Elfwin, the brother of that prince.
Desirous, however, of composing all animosities with Egfrid, he payed him a sum
of money, as a compensation for the loss of his brother. After a prosperous
reign of thirty years, he resigned the crown to Kendred, son of Wolflhere, and
retired into the monastery of Bardney[n100]. Kendred returned the present of the
crown to Ceolred, the son of Ethelred; and making a pilgrimage to Rome, passed
his life there in pennance and devotion. The place of Ceolred was supplied by
Ethelbald, great-grand-nephew to Penda by Alwy, his brother; and this prince,
being slain in a mutiny, was succeeded by Offa, who was a degree more remote
from Penda, by Eawa, another brother.

{#58} ^This^ prince, who mounted the throne in 755[n101], had
some great qualities, and was successful in his warlike enterprizes against
Lothaire, king of Kent, and Kenwulph, king of Wessex. He defeated the former in
a bloody battle at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced his kingdom to a state of
dependance: he gained a victory over the latter at Bensington in Oxfordshire;
and conquering that county, together with that of Glocester, annexed both to his
dominions. But all these successes were stained by his treacherous murder of
Ethelbert, king of the East-Angles, and his violent seizing of that kingdom.
This young prince, who is said to have possessed great merit, had paid his
addresses to Elfrida, the daughter of Offa, and was invited with all his retinue
to Hereford, in order to solemnize the nuptials. Amidst the joy and festivity of
these entertainments, he was seized by Offa, and secretly beheaded: and though
Elfrid, who abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warning to the
East-Anglian nobility, who escaped into their own country, Offa, having
extinguished the royal family, succeeded in his design of subduing that
kingdom[n102]. The perfidious prince, desirous of re-establishing his character
in the world, and perhaps of appeasing the remorses of his own conscience, payed
great court to the clergy, and practised all the monkish devotion, |so much
esteemed in that ignorant and superstitious age. He gave the tenth of his goods
to the church[n103]; bestowed rich donations on the cathedral of Hereford; and
even made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his great power and riches could not fail
of procuring him the papal absolution. The better to ingratiate himself with the
sovereign pontiff, he engaged to pay him a yearly donation for the support of an
English college at Rome[n104], and in order to raise the sum, he imposed a tax
of a penny on each house possessed of thirty pence a year. This imposition,
being afterwards levied on all England, was commonly denominated Peter's
pence[n105]; and though conferred at first as a gift, was afterwards claimed as
a tribute by the Roman pontiff. Carrying his hypocrisy still farther, Offa,
feigning to be directed by a vision from heaven, discovered at Verulam the
reliques of St. Alban, the martyr, and endowed a magnificent monastery in that
place[n106]. Moved by all these acts of piety, Malmesbury, one of the best of
the old English historians, declares himself at a loss to determine[n107]
whether the merits or crimes of this prince preponderated. Offa died, after a
reign of thirty-nine years, in 794[n108].

{#59} ^This^ prince was become so considerable in the Heptarchy,
that the emperor Charlemagne entered into an alliance and friendship with him; a
circumstance, which did honour to Offa; as distant princes at that time had
usually little communication with each other. That emperor being a great lover
of learning and learned men, in an age very barren of that ornament, Offa, at
his desire, sent him over Alcuin, a clergyman much celebrated for his knowledge,
who received great honours from Charlemagne, and even became his preceptor in
the sciences. The chief reason, why he had at first desired the company of
Alcuin, was that he might oppose his learning to the heresy of Felix, bishop of
Urgel in Catalonia; who maintained, that Jesus Christ, considered in his human
nature, could, more properly, be denominated the adoptive than the natural son
of God[n109]. This heresy was condemned in the council of Francfort, held in
794, and consisting of 300 bishops. Such were the questions which were agitated
in that age, and which employed |the attention, not only of cloystered scholars,
but of the wisest and greatest princes[n110].

{#60} ^Egfrith^ succeeded to his father, Offa, but survived him
only five months[n111]; when he made way for Kenulph, a descendant of the royal
family. This prince waged war against Kent; and taking Egbert, the king,
prisoner, he cut off his hands, and put out his eyes; leaving Cuthred, his own
brother, in possession of the crown of that kingdom. Kenulph was killed in an
insurrection of the East Anglians, whose crown his predecessor, Offa, had
usurped. He left his son, Kenelm, a minor; who was murdered the same year by his
sister, Quendrade, who had entertained the ambitious views of assuming the
government[n112]. But she was supplanted by her uncle, Ceolulf; who, two years
after, was dethroned by Beornulf. The reign of this usurper, who was not of the
royal family, was short and unfortunate: He was defeated by the West-Saxons, and
killed by his own subjects, the East–Angles[n113]. Ludican, his successor,
underwent the same fate[n114]; and Wiglaff, who mounted this unstable throne,
and found everything in the utmost confusion, could not withstand the fortune of
Egbert, who united all the Saxon kingdoms into one great monarchy.

{#61} THIS kingdom made no great figure in the Heptarchy; and
the history of it is very imperfect. Sleda succeeded to his father, Erkinwin,
the founder of the monarchy; and made way for his son, Sebert, who, being nephew
to Ethelbert, king of Kent, was persuaded by that prince to embrace the
Christian faith[n115]. His sons and conjunct successors, Sexted and Seward,
relapsed into idolatry, and were soon after slain in a battle against the
West-Saxons. To shew the rude manner of living in that age; Bede tells us[n116],
that |these two kings expressed great desire to eat the white bread, distributed
by Mellitus, the bishop, at the communion[n117]. But on his refusing them,
unless they would submit to be baptized, they expelled him their dominions. The
names of the other princes, who reigned successively in Essex, are Sigebert the
little, Sigebert the good, who restored Christianity, Swithelm, Sigheri, Offa.
This last prince, having made a vow of chastity, notwithstanding his marriage
with Keneswitha, a Mercian princess, daughter to Penda, went in pilgrimage to
Rome, and shut himself up during the rest of his life in a cloyster. Selred, his
successor, reigned thirty-eight years; and was the last of the royal line: The
failure of which threw the kingdom into great confusion, and reduced it to
dependance under Mercia[n118]. Switherd first acquired the crown, by the
concession of the Mercian princes; and his death made way for Sigeric, who ended
his life in a pilgrimage to Rome. His successor, Sigered, unable to defend his
kingdom, submitted to the victorious arms of Egbert.

{#62} THE history of this kingdom, the smallest in the
Heptarchy, is still more imperfect than that of Essex. {AE}lla, the founder of
the monarchy, left the crown to his son, Cissa, who is chiefly remarkable for
his long reign of seventy-six years. During his time, the South Saxons fell
almost into a total dependance on the kingdom of Wessex; and we scarcely know
the names of the princes, who were possessed of this titular sovereignty.
Adelwalch, the last of them, was subdued in battle by Ceadwalla, king of Wessex,
and was slain in the action; leaving two infant sons, who, falling into the hand
of the conqueror, were murdered by him. The abbot of Redford opposed the order
for this execution, but could only prevail on Ceadwalla to suspend it, till they
should be baptized. Bercthun and Audhun, two noblemen of character, resisted
some time the violence of the West-Saxons; but their opposition |served only to
prolong the miseries of their country; and the subduing of this kingdom was the
first step, which the West-Saxons made towards acquiring the sole monarchy of
England[n119].

{#63} THE kingdom of Wessex, which finally swallowed up all the
other Saxon states, met with great resistance on its first establishment: and
the Britons, who were now enured to arms, yielded not tamely their possessions
to those invaders. Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, and his son, Kenric,
fought many successful, and some unsuccessful battles, against the natives; and
the martial spirit, common to all the Saxons, was, by means of these
hostilities, carried to the greatest height among this tribe. Ceaulin, who was
the son and successor of Kenric, and who began his reign in 560, was still more
ambitious and enterprizing than his predecessors; and by waging continual war
against the Britons, he added a great part of the counties of Devon and Somerset
to his other dominions. Carried along by the tide of success, he invaded the
other Saxon states in his neighbourhood, and becoming terrible to all, he
provoked a general confederacy against him. This alliance proved successful
under the conduct of Ethelbert, king of Kent; and Ceaulin, who had lost the
affections of his own subjects by his violent disposition, and had now fallen
into contempt from his misfortunes, was expelled the throne[n120], and died in
exile and misery. Cuichelme, and Cuthwin, his sons, governed jointly the
kingdom, till the expulsion of the latter in 591, and the death of the former in
593, made way for Cealric, to whom succeeded Ceobald in 593, by whose death,
which happened in 611, Kynegils inherited the crown. This prince embraced
Christianity[n121], through the persuasion of Oswald, king of Northumberland,
who had married his daughter, and who had attained a great ascendant in the
Heptarchy. |Kenwalch next succeeded to the monarchy, and dying in 672, left the
succession so much disputed, that Sexburga, his widow, a woman of spirit[n122],
kept possession of the government till her death, which happened two years
after. Escwin then peaceably acquired the crown; and, after a short reign of two
years, made way for Kentwin, who governed nine years. Ceodwalla, his successor,
mounted not the throne without opposition; but proved a great prince, according
to the ideas of those times; that is, he was enterprizing, warlike, and
successful. He entirely subdued the kingdom of Sussex, and annexed it to his own
dominions. He made inroads into Kent; but met with resistance from Widred, the
king, who proved successful against Mollo, brother to Ceodwalla, and slew him in
a skirmish. Ceodwalla at last, tired with wars and bloodshed, was seized with a
fit of devotion; bestowed several endowments on the church; and made a
pilgrimage to Rome, where he received baptism, and died in 689. Ina, his
successor, inherited the military virtues of Ceodwalla, and added to them the
more valuable ones of justice, policy, and prudence. He made war upon the
Britons in Somerset: and having finally subdued that province, he treated the
vanquished with a humanity, hitherto unknown to the Saxon conquerors. He allowed
the proprietors to retain possession of their lands, encouraged marriages and
alliances between them and his ancient subjects, and gave them the privilege of
being governed by the same laws. These laws he augmented and ascertained; and
though he was disturbed by some insurrections at home, his long reign of
thirty-seven years may be regarded as one of the most glorious and most
prosperous of the Heptarchy. In the decline of his age he made a pilgrimage to
Rome; and after his return, shut himself up in a cloyster, where he died.

{#64} ^Though^ the kings of Wessex had always been princes of
the blood, descended from Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, the order of
succession had been far from exact; and a more remote prince had often found
means to mount the throne, in preference to one descended from a nearer branch
of the royal family. Ina, therefore, having no children of his own, and lying
much under the influence of Ethelburga, his queen, left by will the succession
to Adelard, her brother, who was his remote kinsman: But this |destination did
not take place without some difficulty. Oswald, a prince more nearly allied to
the crown, took arms against Adelard; but he being suppressed, and dying soon
after, the title of Adelard was not any farther disputed; and in the year 741,
he was succeeded by his cousin, Cudred. The reign of this prince was
distinguished by a great victory, which he obtained, by means of Edelhun, his
general, over Ethelbald, king of Mercia. His death made way for Sigebert, his
kinsman, who governed so ill, that his people rose in an insurrection, and
dethroned him, crowning Cenulph in his stead. The exiled prince found a refuge
with duke Cumbran, governor of Hampshire; who, that he might add new obligations
to Sigebert, gave him many salutary counsels for his future conduct, accompanied
with some reprehensions for the past. But these were so much resented by the
ungrateful prince, that he conspired against the life of his protector, and
treacherously murdered him. After this infamous action, he was forsaken by all
the world; and skulking about in the wilds and forests, was at last discovered
by a servant of Cumbran's, who instantly took revenge upon him for the murder of
his master[n123].

{#65} ^Cenulph^, who had obtained the crown on the expulsion of
Sigebert, was fortunate in many expeditions against the Britons of Cornwal; but
afterwards lost some reputation by his ill success against Offa, king of
Mercia[n124]. Kynehard also, brother to the deposed Sigebert, gave him
disturbance; and though expelled the kingdom, he hovered on the frontiers, and
watched an opportunity for attacking his rival. The king had an intrigue with a
young woman, who lived at Merton in Surrey, whither having secretly retired, he
was on a sudden invironed, in the night-time, by Kynehard and his followers, and
after making a vigorous resistance, was murdered, with all his attendants. The
nobility and people of the neighbourhood, rising next day in arms, took revenge
on Kynehard for the slaughter of their king, and put every one to the sword, who
had been engaged in that criminal enterprize. This event happened in 784.

{#66} ^Brithric^ next obtained possession of the government,
though remotely descended from the royal family; but he enjoyed not that dignity
without inquietude. Eoppa, nephew to king Ina, by his |brother Ingild, who died
before that prince, had begot Eata, father to Alchmond, from whom sprung
Egbert[n125], a young man of the most promising hopes, who gave great jealousy
to Brithric, the reigning prince, both because he seemed by his birth better
intitled to the crown, and because he had acquired, to an eminent degree, the
affections of the people. Egbert, sensible of his danger from the suspicions of
Brithric, secretly withdrew into France[n126]; where he was well received by
Charlemagne. By living in the court, and serving in the armies of that prince,
the most able and most generous that had appeared in Europe during several ages,
he acquired those accomplishments, which afterwards enabled him to make such a
shining figure on the throne. And familiarizing himself to the manners of the
French, who, as Malmesbury observes[n127], were eminent both for valour and
civility, above all the western nations, he learned to polish the rudeness and
barbarity of the Saxon character: His early misfortunes thus proved of singular
advantage to him.

{#67} ^It^ was not long ere Egbert had opportunities of
displaying his natural and acquired talents. Brithric, King of Wessex, had
married Eadburga, natural daughter of Offa, king of Mercia, a profligate woman,
equally infamous for cruelty and for incontinence. Having great influence over
her husband, she often instigated him to destroy such of the nobility as were
obnoxious to her; and where this expedient failed, she scrupled not being
herself active in traiterous attempts against them. She had mixed a cup of
poison for a young nobleman, who had acquired her husband's friendship, and had
on that account become the object of her jealousy: But unfortunately, the king
drank of the fatal cup along with his favourite, and soon after expired[n128].
This tragical incident, joined to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga so odious,
that she was obliged to fly into France; whence Egbert was at the same time
recalled by the nobility, in order to ascend the throne of his ancestors[n129].
He attained that dignity in the last year of the eighth century.

{#68} ^In^ the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, an exact rule of
succession was either unknown or not strictly observed; and thence the reigning
|prince was continually agitated with jealousy against all the princes of the
blood, whom he still considered as rivals, and whose death alone could give him
entire security in his possession of the throne. From this fatal cause, together
with the admiration of the monastic life, and the opinion of merit, attending
the preservation of chastity even in a married state, the royal families had
been entirely extinguished in all the kingdoms except that of Wessex; and the
emulations, suspicions, and conspiracies, which had formerly been confined to
the princes of the blood alone, were now diffused among all the nobility in the
several Saxon states. Egbert was the sole descendant of those first conquerors
who subdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree
from Woden, the supreme divinity of their ancestors. But that prince, though
invited by this favourable circumstance to make attempts on the neighbouring
Saxons, gave them for some time no disturbance, and rather chose to turn his
arms against the Britons in Cornwal, whom he defeated in several battles[n130].
He was recalled from the conquest of that country by an invasion made upon his
dominions by Bernulf, King of Mercia.

{#69} ^The^ Mercians, before the accession of Egbert, had very
nearly attained the absolute sovereignty in the Heptarchy: They had reduced the
East-Angles under subjection, and established tributary princes in the kingdoms
of Kent and Essex. Northumberland was involved in anarchy; and no state of any
consequence remained but that of Wessex, which, much inferior in extent to
Mercia, was supported solely by the great qualities of its sovereign. Egbert led
his army against the invaders; and encountering them at Ellandun in Wiltshire,
obtained a complete victory, and by the great slaughter which he made of them in
their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians. Whilst he
himself, in prosecution of his victory, entered their country on the side of
Oxfordshire, and threatened the heart of their dominions; he sent an army into
Kent, commanded by Ethelwolph, his eldest son[n131], and expelling Baldred, the
tributary king, soon made himself master of that country. The kingdom of Essex
was conquered with equal facility; and the East-Angles, from their hatred to the
Mercian government, which had been established over them by treachery and
|violence, and probably exercised with tyranny, immediately rose in arms, and
craved the protection of Egbert[n132]. Bernulf, the Mercian king, who marched
against them, was defeated and slain; and two years after, Ludican, his
successor, met with the same fate. These insurrections and calamities
facilitated the enterprizes of Egbert, who advanced into the center of the
Mercian territories, and made easy conquests over a dispirited and divided
people. In order to engage them more easily to submission, he allowed Wiglef,
their countryman, to retain the title of king, whilst he himself exercised the
real powers of sovereignty[n133]. The anarchy, which prevailed in
Northumberland, tempted him to carry still farther his victorious arms; and the
inhabitants, unable to resist his power, and desirous of possessing some
established form of government, were forward, on his first appearance, to send
deputies, who submitted to his authority, and swore allegiance to him as their
sovereign. Egbert, however, still allowed to Northumberland, as he had done to
Mercia and East-Anglia, the power of electing a king, who paid him tribute, and
was dependant on him.

{#70} ^Thus^ were united all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy in
one great state, near four hundred years after the first arrival of the Saxons
in Britain; and the fortunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert at last effected
what had been so often attempted in vain by so many princes[n134]. Kent,
Northumberland, and Mercia, which had successively aspired to general dominion,
were now incorporated in his empire; and the other subordinate kingdoms seemed
willingly to share the same fate. His territories were nearly of the same extent
with what is now properly called England; and a favourable prospect was afforded
to the Anglo-Saxons, of establishing a civilized monarchy, possessed of
tranquillity within itself, and secure against foreign invasion. This great
event happened in the year 827[n135].

{#71} ^The^ Saxons, though they had been so long settled in the
island, seem not as yet to have been much improved beyond their German
ancestors, either in arts, civility, knowledge, humanity, justice, or obedience
to the laws. Even Christianity, though it opened the way to connexions between
them and the more polished states of Europe, |had not hitherto been very
effectual, in banishing their ignorance, or softening their barbarous manners.
As they received that doctrine through the corrupted channels of Rome, it
carried along with it a great mixture of credulity and superstition, equally
destructive to the understanding and to morals. The reverence towards saints and
reliques seems to have almost supplanted the adoration of the Supreme Being:
Monastic observances were esteemed more meritorious than the active virtues: The
knowledge of natural causes was neglected from the universal belief of
miraculous interpositions and judgments: Bounty to the church atoned for every
violence against society: And the remorses for cruelty, murder, treachery,
assassination, and the more robust vices, were appeased, not by amendment of
life, but by pennances, servility to the monks, and an abject and illiberal
devotion[n136]. The reverence for the clergy had been carried to such a height,
that, wherever a person appeared in a sacerdotal habit, though on the highway,
the people flocked around him; and showing him all marks of profound respect,
received every word he uttered as the most sacred oracle[n137]. Even the
military virtues, so inherent in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected;
and the nobility, preferring the security and sloth of the cloyster to the
tumults and glory of war, valued themselves chiefly on endowing monasteries, of
which they assumed the government[n138]. The several kings too, being extremely
impoverished by continual benefactions to the church, to which the states of
their kingdoms had weakly assented, could bestow no rewards on valour or
military services, and retained not even sufficient influence to support their
government[n139].

{#72} ^Another^ inconvenience, which attended this corrupt
species of Christianity, was the superstitious attachment to Rome, and the
gradual subjection of the kingdom to a foreign jurisdiction. The |Britons,
having never acknowledged any subordination to the Roman pontiff, had conducted
all ecclesiastical government by their domestic synods and councils[n140]: But
the Saxons, receiving their religion from Roman monks, were taught at the same
time a profound reverence for that see, and were naturally led to regard it as
the capital of their religion. Pilgrimages to Rome were represented as the most
meritorious acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of rank undertook
this tedious journey[n141]; but kings themselves, abdicating their crowns,
sought for a secure passport to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New
reliques, perpetually sent from that endless mint of superstition, and magnified
by lying miracles, invented in convents, operated on the astonished minds of the
multitude. And every prince has attained the eulogies of the monks, the only
historians of those ages, not in proportion to his civil and military virtues,
but to his devoted attachment towards their order, and his superstitious
reverence for Rome.

{#73} ^The^ sovereign pontiff, encouraged by this blindness and
submissive disposition of the people, advanced every day in his encroachments on
the independance of the English churches. Wilfrid, bishop of Lindisferne, the
sole prelate of the Northumbrian kingdom, encreased this subjection in the
eighth century, by his making an appeal to Rome against the decisions of an
English synod, which had abridged his diocese by the erection of some new
bishoprics[n142]. Agatho, the pope, readily embraced this precedent of an appeal
to his court; and Wilfrid, though the haughtiest and most luxurious prelate of
his age[n143], having obtained with the people the character of sanctity, was
thus able to lay the foundation of this papal pretension.

{#74} ^The^ great topic, by which Wilfrid confounded the
imaginations of men, was, that St. Peter, to whose custody the keys of heaven
were entrusted, would certainly refuse admittance to every one who should be
wanting in respect to his successor. This conceit, well suited to vulgar
conceptions, made great impression on the people during several ages; and has
not even at present lost all influence in the catholic countries.

{#75} ^Had^ this abject superstition produced general peace and
tranquillity, it had made some atonement for the ills attending it; but besides
the usual avidity of men for power and riches, frivolous controversies in
theology were engendered by it, which were so much the more fatal, as they
admitted not, like the others, of any final determination from established
possession. The disputes, excited in Britain, were of the most ridiculous kind,
and entirely worthy of those ignorant and barbarous ages. There were some
intricacies, observed by all the Christian churches, in adjusting the day of
keeping Easter; which depended on a complicated consideration of the course of
the sun and moon: And it happened that the missionaries, who had converted the
Scots and Britons, had followed a different calendar from that which was
observed at Rome, in the age when Augustine converted the Saxons. The priests
also of all the Christian churches were accustomed to shave part of their head;
but the form given to this tonsure, was different in the former from what was
practised in the latter. The Scots and Britons pleaded the antiquity of _their_
usages: The Romans, and their disciples, the Saxons, insisted on the
universality of _theirs._ That Easter must necessarily be kept by a rule, which
comprehended both the day of the year and age of the moon, was agreed by all;
that the tonsure of a priest could not be omitted without the utmost impiety,
was a point undisputed: But the Romans and Saxons called their antagonists
schismatics; because they celebrated Easter on the very day of the full moon in
March, if that day fell on a Sunday, instead of waiting till the Sunday
following; and because they shaved the fore-part of their head from ear to ear,
instead of making that tonsure on the crown of the head, and in a circular form.
In order to render their antagonists odious, they affirmed, that, once in seven
years, they concurred with the Jews in the time of celebrating that
festival[n144]: And that they might recommend their own form of tonsure, they
maintained that it imitated symbolically the crown of thorns worn by Christ in
his passion; whereas the other form was invented by Simon Magus, without any
regard to that representation[n145]. These controversies had, from the
beginning, excited such animosity between the British and Romish priests, that,
instead of concurring in their endeavours to |convert the idolatrous Saxons,
they refused all communion together, and each regarded his opponent as no better
than a Pagan[n146]. The dispute lasted more than a century; and was at last
finished, not by men's discovering the folly of it, which would have been too
great an effort for human reason to accomplish, but by the entire prevalence of
the Romish ritual over the Scotch and British[n147]. Wilfrid, bishop of
Lindisferne, acquired great merit, both with the court of Rome and with all the
southern Saxons, by expelling the quartodeciman schism, as it was called, from
the Northumbrian kingdom, into which the neighbourhood of the Scots had formerly
introduced it[n148].

{#76} ^Theodore^, archbishop of Canterbury, called, in the year
680, a synod at Hatfield, consisting of all the bishops in Britain[n149]; where
was accepted and ratified the decree of the Lateran council, summoned by Martin,
against the heresy of the Monothelites. The council and synod maintained, in
opposition to these heretics, that, though the divine and human nature in Christ
made but one person; yet had they different inclinations, wills, acts, and
sentiments, and that the unity of the person implied not any unity in the
consciousness[n150]. This opinion it seems somewhat difficult to comprehend; and
no one, unacquainted with the ecclesiastical history of those ages, could
imagine the height of zeal and violence, with which it was then inculcated. The
decree of the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, execrable, wicked,
abominable, and even diabolical; and curses and anathematizes them to all
eternity[n151].

{#77} ^The^ Saxons, from the first introduction of Christianity
among them, had admitted the use of images; and perhaps, that religion, without
some of those exterior ornaments, had not made so quick a progress with these
idolaters: But they had not paid any species of worship or address to images;
and this abuse never prevailed among Christians, till it received the sanction
of the second council of Nice.

{#n15} This question has been disputed with as great zeal and
even acrimony between the Scotch and Irish antiquaries, as if the honour of
their respective countries were the most deeply concerned in the decision. We
shall not enter into any detail on so uninteresting a subject; but shall propose
our opinion in a few words. It appears more than probable, from the similitude
of language and manners, that Britain either was originally peopled, or was
subdued, by the migration of inhabitants from Gaul, and Ireland from Britain:
The position of the several countries, is an additional reason that favours this
conclusion. It appears also probable, that the migrations of that colony of
Gauls or Celts, who peopled or subdued Ireland, was originally made from the
north west parts of Britain; and this conjecture (if it do not merit a higher
name) is founded both on the Irish language, which is a very different dialect
from the Welsh and from the language anciently spoken in South Britain, and on
the vicinity of Lancashire, Cumberland, Galloway and Argyleshire to that island.
These events, as they passed long before the age of history and records, must be
known by reasoning alone, which in this case seems to be pretty satisfactory:
Caesar and Tacitus, not to mention a multitude of other Greek and Roman authors,
were guided by like inferences. But besides these primitive facts, which lie in
a very remote antiquity, it is a matter of positive and undoubted testimony,
that the Roman province of Britain, during the time of the lower empire, was
much infested by bands of robbers or pyrates, whom the provincial Britons called
Scots or Scuits; a name which was probably used as a term of reproach, and which
these banditti themselves did not acknowledge or assume. We may infer from two
passages in Claudian, and from one in Orosius and another in Isidore, that the
chief fear of these Scots was in Ireland. That some part of the Irish
freebooters migrated back to the north-west parts of Britain, whence their
ancestors had probably been derived in a more remote age is positively asserted
by Bede, and implied in Gildas. I grant, that neither Bede nor Gildas are
Caesars or Tacituses; but such as they are, they remain the sole testimony on
the subject, and therefore must be relied on for want of better: Happily, the
frivolousness of the question corresponds to the weakness of the authorities.
Not to mention, that, if any part of the traditional history of a barbarous
people can be relied on, it is the genealogy of nations, and even sometimes that
of families. It is in vain to argue against these facts from the supposed
warlike disposition of the Highlanders and unwarlike of the ancient Irish. Those
arguments are still much weaker than the authorities. Nations change very
quickly in these particulars. The Britons were unable to resist the Picts and
Scots, and invited over the Saxons for their defence, who repelled those
invaders: Yet the same Britons valiantly resisted for 150 years not only this
victorious band of Saxons, but infinite numbers more, who poured in upon them
from all quarters. Robert Bruce in 1322 made a peace, in which England, after
many defeats, was constrained to acknowledge the independance of his country:
Yet in no more distant period than ten years after, Scotland was totally subdued
by a small handful of English, led by a few private noblemen. All history is
full of such events. The Irish Scots, in the course of two or three centuries,
might find time and opportunities sufficient to settle in North Britain, though
we can neither assign the period nor causes of that revolution. Their barbarous
manner of life rendered them much fitter than the Romans for subduing these
mountaineers. And in a word, it is clear, from the language of the two
countries, that the Highlanders and the Irish are the same people, and that the
one are a colony from the other. We have positive evidence, which, though from
neutral persons, is not perhaps the best that may be wished for, that the
former, in the third or fourth century, sprang from the latter: We have no
evidence at all that the latter sprang from the former. I shall add, that the
name of Erse or Irish, given by the low-country Scots to the language of the
Scotch Highlanders, is a certain proof of the traditional opinion, delivered
from father to son, that the latter people came originally from Ireland.

{#n136} These abuses were common to all the European churches;
but the priests in Italy, Spain and Gaul, made some atonement for them by other
advantages, which they rendered society. For several ages, they were almost all
Romans, or, in other words, the ancient natives; and they preserved the Roman
language and laws, with some remains of the former civility. But the priests in
the Heptarchy, after the first missionaries, were wholly Saxons, and almost as
ignorant and barbarous as the laity. They contributed, therefore, little to the
improvement of the society in knowledge or the arts.
