{#1} THE government of the Germans, and that of all the northern nations, who
established themselves on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free; and
those fierce people, accustomed to independance and enured to arms, were more
guided by persuasion than authority, in the submission which they paid to their
princes. The military despotism, which had taken place in the Roman empire, and
which, previously to the irruption of those conquerors, had sunk the genius of
men, and destroyed every noble principle of science and virtue, was unable to
resist the vigorous efforts of a free people; and Europe, as from a new epoch,
rekindled her ancient spirit, and shook off the base servitude to arbitrary will
and authority, under which she had so long laboured. The free constitutions then
established, however impaired by the encroachments of succeeding princes, still
preserve an air of independance and legal administration, which distinguish |the
European nations; and if that part of the globe maintain sentiments of liberty,
honour, equity, and valour superior to the rest of mankind, it owes these
advantages chiefly to the seeds implanted by those generous barbarians.

{#2} ^The^ Saxons, #First Saxon government.# who subdued Britain, as they
enjoyed great liberty in their own country, obstinately retained that invaluable
possession in their new settlement; and they imported into this island the same
principles of independance, which they had inherited from their ancestors. The
chieftains (for such they were, more properly than kings or princes) who
commanded them in those military expeditions, still possessed a very limited
authority; and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than subdued the ancient
inhabitants, they were indeed transplanted into a new territory, but preserved
unaltered all their civil and military institutions. The language was pure
Saxon; even the names of places, which often remain while the tongue entirely
changes, were almost all affixed by the conquerors; the manners and customs were
wholly German; and the same picture of a fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn
by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, will suit those founders of the English
government. The king, so far from being invested with arbitrary power, was only
considered as the first among the citizens; his authority depended more on his
personal qualities than on his station; he was even so far on a level with the
people, that a stated price was fixed for his head, and a legal fine was levied
upon his murderer, which, though proportionate to his station, and superior to
that paid for the life of a subject, was a sensible mark of his subordination to
the community.

{#3} #Succession of the kings.# ^It^ is easy to imagine, that an independant
people, so little restrained by law, and cultivated by science, would not be
very strict in maintaining a regular succession of their princes. Though they
paid great regard to the royal family, and ascribed to it an undisputed
superiority, they either had no rule, or none that was steadily observed, in
filling the vacant throne; and present convenience, in that emergency, was more
attended to than general principles. We are not however to suppose, that the
crown was considered as altogether elective; and that a regular plan was traced
by the constitution for supplying, by the suffrages of the people, every vacancy
made by the demise of the first magistrate. If any king left a son of an age and
capacity fit for government, the |young prince naturally stepped into the
throne: If he was a minor, his uncle, or the next prince of the blood, was
promoted to the government, and left the sceptre to his posterity: Any
sovereign, by taking previous measures with the leading men, had it greatly in
his power to appoint his successor: All these changes, and indeed the ordinary
administration of government, required the express concurrence; or at least the
tacit acquiescence of the people; but possession, however obtained, was
extremely apt to secure their obedience, and the idea of any right, which was
once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is so much the case in all
barbarous monarchies, and occurs so often in the history of the Anglo-Saxons,
that we cannot consistently entertain any other notion of their government. The
idea of an hereditary succession in authority is so natural to men, and is so
much fortified by the usual rule in transmitting private possessions, that it
must retain a great influence on every society, which does not exclude it by the
refinements of a republican constitution. But as there is a material difference
between government and private possessions, and every man is not as much
qualified for exercising the one, as for enjoying the other, a people, who are
not sensible of the general advantages attending a fixed rule, are apt to make
great leaps in the succession, and frequently to pass over the person, who, had
he possessed the requisite years and abilities, would have been thought entitled
to the sovereignty. Thus, these monarchies are not, strictly speaking, either
elective or hereditary; and though the destination of a prince may often be
followed in appointing his successor, they can as little be regarded as wholly
testamentary. The states by their suffrage may sometimes establish a sovereign;
but they more frequently recognize the person, whom they find established: A few
great men take the lead; the people, overawed and influenced, acquiesce in the
government; and the reigning prince, provided he be of the royal family, passes
undisputedly for the legal sovereign.

{#4} #The Wittenagemot.# ^It^ is confessed, that our knowledge of the
Anglo-Saxon history and antiquities is too imperfect to afford us means of
determining with certainty all the prerogatives of the crown and privileges of
the people, or of giving an exact delineation of that government. It is probable
also, that the constitution might be somewhat different in the different
kingdoms of the Heptarchy, and that it changed considerably during the course of
six centuries, which |elapsed from the first invasion of the Saxons till the
Norman conquest[n1]. But most of these differences and changes, with their
causes and effects, are unknown to us: It only appears, that, at all times, and
in all the kingdoms, there was a national council, called a Wittenagemot or
assembly of the wise men, (for that is the import of the term) whose consent was
requisite for enacting laws, and for ratifying the chief acts of public
administration. The preambles to all the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, Edward
the Elder, Athelstan, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred, and Edward the Confessor; even
those to the laws of Canute, though a kind of conqueror, put this matter beyond
controversy, and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal government. But
who were the constituent members of this Wittenagemot has not been determined
with certainty by antiquaries. It is agreed, that the bishops and abbots[n2]
were an essential part; and it is also evident, from the tenor of those ancient
laws, that the Wittenagemot enacted statutes which regulated the ecclesiastical
as well as civil government, and that those dangerous principles, by which the
church is totally severed from the state, were hitherto unknown to the
Anglo-Saxons[n3]. It also appears, that the aldermen or governors of counties,
who, after the Danish times, were often called earls[n4], were admitted into
this council, and gave their consent to the public statutes. But besides the
prelates and aldermen, there is also mention of the wites or wise-men, as a
component part of the Wittenagemot; but who _these_ were, is not so clearly
ascertained by the laws or the history of that period. The matter would probably
be of difficult discussion, even were it examined impartially; but as our modern
parties have chosen to divide on this point, the question has been disputed with
the |greater obstinacy, and the arguments on both sides have become, on that
account, the more captious and deceitful. Our monarchical faction maintain, that
these _wites_ or _sapientes_ were the judges, or men learned in the law: The
popular faction assert them to be representatives of the boroughs, or what we
now call the commons.

{#5} ^The^ expressions, employed by all ancient historians in mentioning the
Wittenagemot, seem to contradict the latter supposition. The members are almost
always called the_ principes, satrapae, optimates, magnates, proceres;_ terms
which seem to suppose an aristocracy, and to exclude the commons. The boroughs
also, from the low state of commerce, were so small and so poor, and the
inhabitants lived in such dependance on the great men[n5], that it seems nowise
probable they would be admitted as a part of the national councils. The commons
are well known to have had no share in the governments established by the
Franks, Burgundians, and other northern nations; and we may conclude, that the
Saxons, who remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than those tribes, would
never think of conferring such an extraordinary privilege on trade and industry.
The military profession alone was honourable among all those conquerors: The
warriors subsisted by their possessions in land: They became considerable by
their influence over their vassals, retainers, tenants, and slaves: And it
requires strong proof to convince us that they would admit any of a rank so much
inferior as the burgesses, to share with them in the legislative authority.
Tacitus indeed affirms, that, among the ancient Germans, the consent of all the
members of the community was required in every important deliberation; but he
speaks not of representatives; and this ancient practice, mentioned by the Roman
historian, could only have place in small tribes, where every citizen might
without inconvenience be assembled upon any extraordinary emergency. After
principalities became extensive; after the difference of property had formed
distinctions more important than those which arose from personal strength and
valour; we may conclude, that the national assemblies must have been more
limited in their number, and composed only of the more considerable citizens.

{#6} ^But^ though we must exclude the burgesses or commons from the Saxon
Wittenagemot, there is some necessity for supposing, that this assembly
consisted of other members than the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the judges
or privy council. For as all these, excepting some of the ecclesiastics[n6],
were anciently appointed by the king, had there been no other legislative
authority, the royal power had been in a great measure absolute, contrary to the
tenor of all the historians, and to the practice of all the northern nations. We
may, therefore, conclude, that the more considerable proprietors of land were,
without any election, constituent members of the national assembly: There is
reason to think, that forty hydes, or between four and five thousand acres, was
the estate requisite for entitling the possessor to this honourable privilege.
We find a passage in an ancient author[n7], by which it appears, that a person
of very noble birth, even one allied to the crown, was not esteemed a _princeps_
(the term usually employed by ancient historians when the Wittenagemot is
mentioned) till he had acquired a fortune of that amount. Nor need we imagine,
that the public council would become disorderly or confused by admitting so
great a multitude. The landed property of England was probably in few hands
during the Saxon times; at least, during the later part of that period: And as
men had hardly any ambition to attend those public councils, there was no danger
of the assembly's becoming too numerous for the dispatch of the little business,
which was brought before them.

{#7} #The Aristocracy.# ^It^ is certain, that, whatever we may determine
concerning the constituent members of the Wittenagemot, in whom, with the king,
the legislature resided, the Anglo-Saxon government, in the period preceding the
Norman conquest, was become extremely aristocratical: The royal authority was
very limited; the people, even if admitted to that assembly, were of little or
no weight and consideration. We have hints given us in historians of the great
|power and riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but happen, after the
abolition of the Heptarchy, when the king lived at a distance from the
provinces, that those great proprietors, who resided on their estates, would
much augment their authority over their vassals and retainers, and over all the
inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence the immeasurable power assumed by
Harold, Godwin, Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Edric and Alfric, who controlled
the authority of the kings, and rendered themselves quite necessary in the
government. The two latter, though detested by the people, on account of their
joining a foreign, enemy still preserved their power and influence; and we may
therefore conclude, that their authority was founded, not on popularity, but on
family rights and possessions. There is one Athelstan, mentioned in the reign of
the king of that name, who is called alderman of all England, and is said to be
half-king; though the monarch himself was a prince of valour and abilities[n8].
And we find, that in the later Saxon times, and in these alone, the great
offices went from father to son, and became, in a manner, hereditary in the
families [n9].

{#8} ^The^ circumstances, attending the invasions of the Danes, would also serve
much to encrease the power of the principal nobility. Those free-booters made
unexpected inroads on all quarters; and there was a necessity, that each county
should resist them by its own force, and under the conduct of its own nobility
and its own magistrates. For the same reason, that a general war, managed by the
united efforts of the whole state, commonly augments the power of the crown;
those private wars and inroads turned to the advantage of the aldermen and
nobles.

{#9} ^Among^ that military and turbulent people, so averse to commerce and the
arts, and so little enured to industry, justice was commonly very ill
administered, and great oppression and violence seem to have prevailed. These
disorders would be encreased |by the exorbitant power of the aristocracy, and
would, in their turn, contribute to encrease it. Men, not daring to rely on the
guardianship of the laws, were obliged to devote themselves to the service of
some chieftain, whose orders they followed even to the disturbance of the
government or the injury of their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them in
return protection from any insult or injustice by strangers. Hence we find, by
the extracts which Dr. Brady has given us from Domesday, that almost all the
inhabitants even of towns, had placed themselves under the clientship of some
particular nobleman, whose patronage they purchased by annual payments, and whom
they were obliged to consider as their sovereign, more than the king himself, or
even the legislature[n10]. A client, though a freeman, was supposed so much to
belong to his patron, that his murderer was obliged by law to pay a fine to the
latter, as a compensation for his loss; in like manner as he paid a fine to the
master for the murder of his slave[n11]. Men, who were of a more considerable
rank, but not powerful enough, each to support himself by his own independant
authority, entered into formal confederacies with each other, and composed a
kind of separate community, which rendered itself formidable to all aggressors.
Dr. Hickes has preserved a curious Saxon bond of this kind, which he calls a
_Sodalitium,_ and which contains many particulars characteristical of the
manners and customs of the times[n12]. All the associates are there said to be
gentlemen of Cambridgeshire; and they swear before the holy reliques to observe
their confederacy, and to be faithful to each other: They promise to bury any of
the associates who dies, in whatever place he had appointed; to contribute to
his funeral charges; and to attend at his interment; and whoever is wanting in
this last duty, binds himself to pay a measure of honey. When any of the
associates is in danger, and calls for the assistance of his fellows, they
promise, besides flying to his succour, to give information to the sheriff; and
if he be negligent in protecting the person exposed to danger, they engage to
levy a fine of one pound upon him: If the president of the society himself be
wanting in this particular, he binds himself to |pay one pound; unless he has
the reasonable excuse of sickness, or of duty to his superior. When any of the
associates is murdered, they are to exact eight pounds from the murderer; and if
he refuse to pay it, they are to prosecute him for the sum at their joint
expence. If any of the associates, who happens to be poor, kill a man, the
society are to contribute by a certain proportion to pay his fine. A mark a
piece, if the fine be 700 shillings; less if the person killed be a clown or
ceorle; the half of that sum, again, if he be a Welshman. But where any of the
associates kills a man, wilfully and without provocation, he must himself pay
the fine. If any of the associates kill any of his fellows, in a like criminal
manner, besides paying the usual fine to the relations of the deceased, he must
pay eight pounds to the society, or renounce the benefit of it: In which case
they bind themselves, under the penalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with
him, except in the presence of the king, bishop, or alderman. There are other
regulations to protect themselves and their servants from all injuries, to
revenge such as are committed, and to prevent their giving abusive language to
each other; and the fine, which they engage to pay for this last offence, is a
measure of honey.

{#10} ^It^ is not to be doubted, but a confederacy of this kind must have been a
great source of friendship and attachment; when men lived in perpetual danger
from enemies, robbers, and oppressors, and received protection chiefly from
their personal valour, and from the assistance of their friends or patrons. As
animosities were then more violent, connexions were also more intimate, whether
voluntary or derived from blood: The most remote degree of propinquity was
regarded: An indelible memory of benefits was preserved: Severe vengeance was
taken for injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the best means of future
security: And the civil union being weak, many private engagements were
contracted, in order to supply its place, and to procure men that safety, which
the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to insure to them.

{#11} ^On^ the whole, notwithstanding the seeming liberty or rather
licentiousness of the Anglo-Saxons, the great body even of the free citizens, in
those ages, really enjoyed much less true liberty, than where the execution of
the laws is the most severe, and where subjects are reduced to the strictest
subordination and dependance |on the civil magistrate. The reason is derived
from the excess itself of that liberty. Men must guard themselves at any price
against insults and injuries; and where they receive not protection from the
laws and magistrate, they will seek it by submission to superiors, and by
herding in some private confederacy, which acts under the direction of a
powerful leader. And thus all anarchy is the immediate cause of tyranny, if not
over the state, at least over many of the individuals.

{#12} ^Security^ was provided by the Saxon laws to all members of the
Wittenagemot, both in going and returning, _except they were notorious thieves
and robbers._

{#13} #The several orders of men.# ^The^ German Saxons, as the other nations of
that continent, were divided into three ranks of men, the noble, the free, and
the slaves[n13]. This distinction they brought over with them into Britain.

{#14} ^The^ nobles were called thanes; and were of two kinds, the king's thanes
and lesser thanes. The latter seem to have been dependant on the former; and to
have received lands, for which they paid rent, services, or attendance in peace
and war[n14]. We know of no title, which raised any one to the rank of thane,
except noble birth and the possession of land. The former was always much
regarded by all the German nations even in their most barbarous state; and as
the Saxon nobility, having little credit, could scarcely burthen their estates
with much debt, and as the commons had little trade or industry by which they
could accumulate riches, these two ranks of men, even though they were not
separated by positive laws, might remain long distinct, and the noble families
continue many ages in opulence and splendor. There were no middle rank of men,
that could gradually mix with their superiors, and insensibly procure to
themselves honour and distinction. If by any extraordinary accident, a mean
person acquired riches, a circumstance so singular made him be known and
remarked; he became the object of envy, as well as of indignation, to all the
nobles; he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired; and he
would find it impossible to protect himself from oppression, except by courting
the patronage of some great chieftain, and paying a large price for his safety.

{#15} ^There^ are two statutes among the Saxon laws, which seem |calculated to
confound those different ranks of men; that of Athelstan, by which a merchant,
who had made three long sea-voyages on his own account, was intitled to the
quality of thane[n15]; and that of the same prince, by which a ceorle or
husbandman, who had been able to purchase five hydes of land, and had a chapel,
a kitchen, a hall, and a bell, was raised to the same distinction[n16]. But the
opportunities were so few, by which a merchant or ceorle could thus exalt
himself above his rank, that the law could never overcome the reigning
prejudices; the distinction between noble and base blood would still be
indelible; and the well-born thanes would entertain the highest contempt for
those legal and factitious ones. Though we are not informed of any of these
circumstances by ancient historians, they are so much founded on the nature of
things, that we may admit them as a necessary and infallible consequence of the
situation of the kingdom during those ages.

{#16} ^The^ cities appear by Domesday-book to have been at the conquest little
better than villages[n17]. York itself, though it was always the second, at
least the third[n18] city in England, and was the capital of a great province,
which never was thoroughly united with the rest, contained then but 1418
families[n19]. Malmesbury tells us[n20] that the great distinction between the
Anglo-Saxon nobility and the French or Norman, was that the latter built
magnificent and stately castles; whereas the former consumed their immense
fortunes in riot and hospitality, and in mean houses. We may thence infer, that
the arts in general were much less advanced in England than in France; a greater
number of idle servants and retainers lived about the great families; and as
these, even in France, were powerful enough to disturb the execution of the
laws, we may judge of the authority, acquired by the aristocracy in England.
When earl Godwin besieged the Confessor in London, he summoned from all |parts
his huscarles, or houseceorles and retainers, and thereby constrained his
sovereign to accept of the conditions, which he was pleased to impose upon him.

{#17} ^The^ lower rank of freemen were denominated ceorles among the
Anglo-Saxons; and where they were industrious, they were chiefly employed in
husbandry: Whence a ceorle, and a husband-man, became in a manner synonimous
terms. They cultivated the farms of the nobility or thanes for which they paid
rent: and they seem to have been removeable at pleasure. For there is little
mention of leases among the Anglo-Saxons: The pride of the nobility, together
with the general ignorance of writing, must have rendered those contracts very
rare, and must have kept the husband-men in a dependant condition. The rents of
farms were then chiefly paid in kind[n21].

{#18} ^But^ the most numerous rank by far in the community seems to have been
the slaves or villains, who were the property of their lords, and were
consequently incapable, themselves, of possessing any property. Dr. Brady
assures us, from a survey of Domesday-book[n22], that, in all the counties of
England, the far greater part of the land was occupied by them, and that the
husbandmen, and still more the socmen, who were tenants that could not be
removed at pleasure, were very few in comparison. This was not the case with the
German nations, as far as we can collect from the account given us by Tacitus.
The perpetual wars in the Heptarchy, and the depredations of the Danes, seem to
have been the cause of this great alteration with the Anglo-Saxons. Prisoners
taken in battle, or carried off in the frequent inroads, were then reduced to
slavery; and became, by right of war[n23], entirely at the disposal of their
lords. Great property in the nobles, especially if joined to an irregular
administration of justice, naturally favours the power of the aristocracy; but
still more so, if the practice of slavery be admitted, and has become very
common. The nobility not only possess the influence which always attends riches,
but also the power which the laws give them over their slaves and villains. It
then becomes difficult, and almost impossible, for a private man to remain
altogether free and independant.

{#19} ^There^ were two kinds of slaves among the Anglo-Saxons; household slaves,
after the manner of the ancients, and praedial or rustic, after the manner of
the Germans[n24]. These latter resembled the serfs, which are at present to be
met with in Poland, Denmark, and some parts of Germany. The power of a master
over his slaves was not unlimited among the Anglo-Saxons, as it was among their
ancestors. If a man beat out his slave's eye or teeth, the slave recovered his
liberty[n25]: If he killed him, he paid a fine to the king; provided the slave
died within a day after the wound or blow: Otherwise it passed unpunished[n26].
The selling of themselves or children to slavery was always the practice among
the German nations[n27], and was continued by the Anglo-Saxons[n28].

{#20} ^The^ great lords and abbots among the Anglo-Saxons possessed a criminal
jurisdiction within their territories and could punish without appeal any
thieves or robbers whom they caught there[n29]. This institution must have had a
very contrary effect to that which was intended, and must have procured robbers
a sure protection on the lands of such noblemen as did not sincerely mean to
discourage crimes and violence.

{#21} #Courts of justice.# ^But^ though the general strain of the Anglo-Saxon
government seems to have become aristocratical, there were still considerable
remains of the ancient democracy, which were not indeed sufficient to protect
the lowest of the people, without the patronage of some great lord, but might
give security, and even some degree of dignity, to the gentry or inferior
nobility. The administration of justice, in particular, by the courts of the
Decennary, the Hundred, and the County, was well calculated to defend general
liberty, and to restrain the power of the nobles. In the county courts or
shiremotes, all the freeholders were assembled twice a-year, and received
appeals from the inferior courts. They there decided all causes, ecclesiastical
as well as civil; and the bishop, together with the alderman or earl, presided
over them[n30]. The affair was determined in a summary manner, without much
pleading, formality, or delay, by a majority of voices; and the bishop and
alderman had |no further authority than to keep order among the freeholders, and
interpose with their opinion[n31]. Where justice was denied during three
sessions by the Hundred, and then by the County court, there lay an appeal to
the king's court[n32]; but this was not practised on slight occasions. The
aldermen received a third of the fines levied in those courts[n33]; and as most
of the punishments were then pecuniary, this perquisite formed a considerable
part of the profits belonging to his office. The two thirds also, which went to
the king, made no contemptible part of the public revenue. Any freeholder was
fined who absented himself thrice from these courts[n34].

{#22} ^As^ the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and writings very rare,
the County or Hundred court was the place where the most remarkable civil
transactions were finished, in order to preserve the memory of them, and prevent
all future disputes. Here testaments were promulgated, slaves manumitted,
bargains of sale concluded; and sometimes, for greater security, the most
considerable of these deeds were inserted in the blank leaves of the parish
Bible, which thus became a kind of register, too sacred to be falsified. It was
not unusual to add to the deed an imprecation on all such as should be guilty of
that crime[n35].

{#23} ^Among^ a people, who lived in so simple a manner as the Anglo-Saxons, the
judicial power is always of greater importance than the legislative. There were
few or no taxes imposed by the states: There were few statutes enacted; and the
nation was less governed by laws, than by customs, which admitted a great
latitude of interpretation. Though it should, therefore, be allowed, that the
Wittenagemot was altogether composed of the principal nobility, the
county-courts, where all the free-holders were admitted, and which regulated all
the daily occurrences of life, formed a wide basis for the government, and were
no contemptible checks on the aristocracy. But there is another power still more
important than either the judicial or legislative; to wit, the power of injuring
or serving by immediate force and violence, for which it is difficult to obtain
redress in courts of justice. In all extensive governments, where the execution
of the laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of the
principal nobility; and the degree of it which |prevails, cannot be determined
so much by the public statutes, as by small incidents in history, by particular
customs, and sometimes by the reason and nature of things. The Highlands of
Scotland have long been entitled by law to every privilege of British subjects;
but it was not till very lately that the common people could in fact enjoy these
privileges.

{#24} ^The^ powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon government are disputed
among historians and antiquaries: The extreme obscurity of the subject, even
though faction had never entered into the question, would naturally have
begotten those controversies. But the great influence of the lords over their
slaves and tenants, the clientship of the burghers, the total want of a middling
rank of men, the extent of the monarchy, the loose execution of the laws, the
continued disorders and convulsions of the state; all these circumstances
evince, that the Anglo-Saxon government became at last extremely aristocratical;
and the events, during the period immediately preceding the conquest, confirm
this inference or conjecture.

{#25} #Criminal law.# ^Both^ the punishments inflicted by the Anglo-Saxon courts
of judicature, and the methods of proof employed in all causes, appear somewhat
singular, and are very different from those which prevail at present among all
civilized nations.

{#26} ^We^ must conceive, that the ancient Germans were little removed from the
original state of nature: The social confederacy among them was more martial
than civil: They had chiefly in view the means of attack or defence against
public enemies, not those of protection against their fellow-citizens: Their
possessions were so slender and so equal, that they were not exposed to great
danger; and the natural bravery of the people made every man trust to himself
and to his particular friends for his defence or vengeance. This defect in the
political union drew much closer the knot of particular confederacies: An insult
upon any man was regarded by all his relations and associates as a common
injury: They were bound by honour, as well as by a sense of common interest, to
revenge his death, or any violence which he had suffered: They retaliated on the
aggressor by like acts of violence; and if he were protected, as was natural and
usual, by his own clan, the quarrel was spread still wider, and bred endless
disorders in the nation.

{#27} ^The^ Frisians, a tribe of the Germans, had never advanced beyond this
wild and imperfect state of society; and the right of private revenge still
remained among them unlimited and uncontrouled[n36]. But the other German
nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one step farther towards completing the
political or civil union. Though it still continued to be an indispensable point
of honour for every clan to revenge the death or injury of a member, the
magistrate had acquired a right of interposing in the quarrel, and of
accommodating the difference. He obliged the person maimed or injured, and the
relations of one killed, to accept of a present from the aggressor and his
relations[n37], as a compensation for the injury[n38], and to drop all farther
prosecution of revenge. That the accommodation of one quarrel might not be the
source of more, this present was fixed and certain, according to the rank of the
person killed or injured, and was commonly paid in cattle, the chief property of
those rude and uncultivated nations. A present of this kind gratified the
revenge of the injured family by the loss which the aggressor suffered: It
satisfied their pride by the submission which it expressed: It diminished their
regret for the loss or injury of a kinsman by their acquisition of new property,
and thus general peace was for a moment restored to the society[n39].

{#28} ^But^ when the German nations had been settled some time in the provinces
of the Roman empire, they made still another step towards a more cultivated
life, and their criminal justice gradually improved and refined itself. The
magistrate, whose office it was to guard public peace and to suppress private
animosities, conceived himself to be injured by every injury done to any of his
people; and besides the compensation to the person who suffered, or to his
family, he thought himself entitled to exact a fine, called the Fridwit, as an
atonement for the breach of peace, and as reward for the pains which he had
taken in accommodating the quarrel. When this idea, which is so natural, was
once suggested, it was willingly received both by sovereign and people. The
numerous fines which were levied, augmented that revenue of the king: And the
people were sensible, that he would be more vigilant in interposing with |his
good offices, when he reaped such immediate advantage from them; and that
injuries would be less frequent, when, besides compensation to the person
injured, they were exposed to this additional penalty[n40].

{#29} ^This^ short abstract contains the history of the criminal jurisprudence
of the northern nations for several centuries. The state of England in this
particular, during the period of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the
collection of ancient laws, published by Lambard and Wilkins. The chief purport
of these laws is not to prevent or entirely suppress private quarrels, which the
legislator knew to be impossible, but only to regulate and moderate them. The
laws of Alfred enjoin, that, if any one know, that his enemy or aggressor, after
doing him an injury, resolves to keep within his own house _and his own
lands[n41],_ he shall not fight him, till he require compensation for the
injury. If he be strong enough to besiege him in his house, he may do it for
seven days without attacking him; and if the aggressor be willing, during that
time, to surrender himself and his arms, his adversary must detain him thirty
days, but is afterwards obliged to restore him safe to his kindred, _and be
content with the compensation._ If the criminal fly to the temple, that
sanctuary must not be violated. Where the assailant has not force sufficient to
besiege the criminal in his house, he must apply to the alderman for assistance;
and if the alderman refuse aid, the assailant must have recourse to the king:
And he is not allowed to assault the house, till after this supreme magistrate
has refused assistance. If any one meet with his enemy, and be ignorant that he
was resolved to keep within his own lands, he must, before he attack him,
require him to surrender himself prisoner, and deliver up his arms; in which
case he may detain him thirty days: But if he refuse to deliver up his arms, it
is then lawful to fight him. A slave may fight in his master's quarrel: A father
may fight in his son's with any one, except with his master[n42].

{#30} ^It^ was enacted by king Ina, that no man should take revenge for |an
injury till he had first demanded compensation, and had been refused it[n43].

{#31} ^King^ Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions the general misery,
occasioned by the multiplicity of private feuds and battles; and he establishes
several expedients for remedying this grievance. He ordains, that, if any one
commit murder, he may, with the assistance of his kindred, pay within a
twelvemonth the fine of his crime, and if they abandon him, he shall alone
sustain the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the murdered person. His
own kindred are free from the feud, but on condition that they neither converse
with the criminal, nor supply him with meat _or other necessaries:_ If any of
them, after renouncing him, receive him into their house, _or give him_
_assistance,_ they are finable to the king, and are involved in the feud. If the
kindred of the murdered person take revenge on any but the criminal himself,
_after he is_ _abandoned by his_ _kindred,_ all their property is forfeited, and
they are declared to be enemies to the king and all his friends[n44]. It is also
ordained, that the fine for murder shall never be remitted by the king[n45], and
that no criminal shall be killed who flies to the church, or any of the king's
towns[n46]; and the king himself declares, that his house shall give no
protection to murderers, till they have satisfied the church by their pennance,
and the kindred of the deceased, by making compensation[n47]. The method
appointed for transacting this composition is found in the same law[n48].

{#32} ^These^ attempts of Edmond, to contract and diminish the feuds, were
contrary to the ancient spirit of the northern barbarians, and were a step
towards a more regular administration of justice. By the Salic law, any man
might, by a public declaration, exempt himself from his family quarrels: But
then he was considered by the law as no longer belonging to the family; and he
was deprived of all right of succession, as the punishment of his
cowardice[n49].

{#33} ^The^ price of the king's head, or his weregild, as it was then called,
was by law 30,000 thrimsas, near 1300 pounds of present money. The price of the
prince's head was 15,000 thrimsas; that of a bishop's or alderman's 8000; a
sheriff's 4000; a thane's or clergyman's 2000; a ceorle's 266. These prices were
fixed by the laws |of the Angles. By the Mercian law, the price of a ceorle's
head was 200 shillings; that of a thane's six times as much; that of a king's
six times more[n50]. By the laws of Kent, the price of the archbishop's head was
higher than that of the king's[n51]. Such respect was then paid to the
ecclesiastics! It must be understood, that, where a person was unable or
unwilling to pay the fine, he was put out of the protection of law and the
kindred of the deceased had liberty to punish him as they thought proper.

{#34} ^Some^ antiquaries[n52] have thought, that these compensations were only
given for man-slaughter, not for wilful murder: But no such distinction appears
in the laws; and it is contradicted by the practice of all the other barbarous
nations[n53], by that of the ancient Germans[n54], and by that curious monument
above mentioned of Saxon antiquity, preserved by Hickes. There is indeed a law
of Alfred's which makes wilful murder capital[n55]; but this seems only to have
been an attempt of that great legislator towards establishing a better police in
the kingdom, and it probably remained without execution. By the laws of the same
prince, a conspiracy against the life of the king might be redeemed by a
fine[n56].

{#35} ^The^ price of all kinds of wounds was likewise fixed by the Saxon laws: A
wound of an inch long under the hair was paid with one shilling: One of a like
size in the face, two shillings: Thirty shillings for the loss of an ear; and so
forth[n57]. There seems not to have been any difference made, according to the
dignity of the person. By the laws of Ethelbert, any one who committed adultery
with his neighbour's wife was obliged to pay him a fine, and buy him another
wife[n58].

{#36} ^These^ institutions are not peculiar to the ancient Germans. They seem to
be the necessary progress of criminal jurisprudence among every free people,
where the will of the sovereign is not implicitly obeyed. We find them among the
ancient Greeks during the time of the Trojan war. Compositions for murder are
mentioned in Nestor's speech to Achilles in the ninth Iliad, and are |called
αποιναι. The Irish, who never had any connections with the German nations,
adopted the same practice till very lately; and the price of a man's head was
called among them his _eric;_ as we learn from Sir John Davis. The same custom
seems also to have prevailed among the Jews[n59].

{#37} ^Theft^ and robbery were frequent among the Anglo-Saxons. In order to
impose some check upon these crimes, it was ordained, that no man should sell or
buy any thing above twenty pence value, except in open market[n60]; and every
bargain of sale must be executed before witnesses[n61]. Gangs of robbers much
disturbed the peace of the country; and the law determined, that a tribe of
banditti, consisting of between seven and thirty-five persons, was to be called
a _turma,_ or troop: Any greater company was denominated an army[n62]. The
punishments for this crime were various, but none of them capital[n63]. If any
man could track his stolen cattle into another's ground, the latter was obliged
to show the tracks out of it, or pay their value[n64].

{#38} ^Rebellion,^ to whatever excess it was carried, was not capital, but might
be redeemed by a sum of money[n65]. The legislators, knowing it impossible to
prevent all disorders, only imposed a higher fine on breaches of the peace
committed in the king's court, or before an alderman or bishop. An alehouse too
seems to have been considered as a privileged place; and any quarrels that arose
there were more severely punished than elsewhere[n66].

{#39} #Rules of proof.# ^If^ the manner of punishing crimes among the
Anglo-Saxons appear singular, the proofs were not less so; and were also the
natural result of the situation of those people. Whatever we may imagine
concerning the usual truth and sincerity of men, who live in a rude and
barbarous state, there is much more falsehood, and even perjury among them, than
among civilized nations: Virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more
cultivated reason, never flourishes to any degree, nor is founded on steady
principles of honour, except where a good education becomes general; and |where
men are taught the pernicious consequences of vice, treachery, and immorality.
Even superstition, though more prevalent among ignorant nations, is but a poor
supply for the defects in knowledge and education: Our European ancestors, who
employed every moment the expedient of swearing on extraordinary crosses and
reliques, were less honourable in all engagements than their posterity, who from
experience have omitted those ineffectual securities. This general proneness to
perjury was much encreased by the usual want of discernment in judges, who could
not discuss an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number, not weigh, the
testimony of the witnesses[n67]. Hence the ridiculous practice of obliging men
to bring compurgators, who, as they did not pretend to know any thing of the
fact, expressed upon oath, that they believed the person spoke true; and these
compurgators were in some cases multiplied to the number of three hundred[n68].
The practice also of single combat was employed by most nations on the continent
as a remedy against false evidence[n69]; and though it was frequently dropped,
from the opposition of the clergy, it was continually revived, from experience
of the falsehood attending the testimony of witnesses[n70]. It became at last a
species of jurisprudence: The cases were determined by law, in which the party
might challenge his adversary, or the witnesses, or the judge himself[n71]: And
though these customs were absurd, they were rather an improvement on the methods
of trial, which had formerly been practised among those barbarous nations, and
which still prevailed among the Anglo-Saxons.

{#40} ^When^ any controversy about a fact became too intricate for those
ignorant judges to unravel, they had recourse to what they called the judgment
of God, that is, to fortune: Their methods of consulting this oracle were
various. One of them was the decision by the cross: It was practised in this
manner. When a person was accused of any crime, he first cleared himself by
oath, and he was |attended by eleven compurgators. He next took two pieces of
wood, one of which was marked with the sign of the cross; and wrapping both up
in wool, he placed them on the altar, or on some celebrated relique. After
solemn prayers for the success of the experiment, a priest, or in his stead some
unexperienced youth, took up one of the pieces of wood, and if he happened upon
that which was marked with the figure of the cross, the person was pronounced
innocent; if otherwise, guilty[n72]. This practice, as it arose from
superstition, was abolished by it in France. The emperor, Lewis the Debonnaire,
prohibited that method of trial, not because it was uncertain, but lest that
sacred figure, says he, of the cross should be prostituted in common disputes
and controversies [n73]

{#41} ^The^ ordeal was another established method of trial among the
Anglo-Saxons. It was practised either by boiling water or red-hot iron. The
former was appropriated to the common people; the latter to the nobility. The
water or iron was consecrated by many prayers, masses, fastings, and
exorcisms[n74]; after which, the person accused either took up a stone sunk in
the water[n75] to a certain depth, or carried the iron to a certain distance;
and his hand being wrapped up, and the covering sealed for three days, if there
appeared, on examining it, no marks of burning, he was pronounced innocent; if
otherwise, guilty[n76]. The trial by cold water was different: The person was
thrown into consecrated water; if he swam, he was guilty; if he sunk,
innocent[n77]. It is difficult for us to conceive, how any innocent person could
ever escape by the one trial, or any criminal be convicted by the other. But
there was another usage admirably calculated for allowing every criminal to
escape, who had confidence enough to try it. A consecrated cake, called a
corsned, was produced; which if the person could swallow and digest, he was
pronounced innocent[n78].

{#42} #Military force.# ^The^ feudal law, if it had place at all among the
Anglo-Saxons, which is doubtful, was not certainly extended over all the landed
property, and was not attended with those consequences of homage, |reliefs[n79],
wardship, marriage, and other burthens, which were inseparable from it in the
kingdoms of the continent. As the Saxons expelled or almost entirely destroyed
the ancient Britons, they planted themselves in this island on the same footing
with their ancestors in Germany, and found no occasion for the feudal
institutions[n80], which were calculated to maintain a kind of standing army,
always in readiness to suppress any insurrection among the conquered people. The
trouble and expence of defending the state in England lay equally upon all the
land; and it was usual for every five hides to equip a man for the service. The
_trinoda necessitas,_ as it was called, or the burthen of military expeditions,
of repairing highways, and of building and supporting bridges, was inseparable
from landed property, even though it belonged to the church or monasteries,
unless exempted by a particular charter[n81]. The ceorles or husbandmen were
provided with arms, and were obliged to take their turn in military duty[n82].
There were computed to be 243,600 hides in England[n83]; consequently the
ordinary military force of the kingdom consisted of 48,720 men; though, no
doubt, on extraordinary occasions, a greater number might be assembled. The king
and nobility had some military tenants, who were called Sithcun-men[n84]. And
there were some lands annexed to the office of aldermen, and to other offices;
but these probably were not of great extent, and were possessed only during
pleasure, as in the commencement of the feudal law in other countries of Europe.

{#43} #Public revenue.# ^The^ revenue of the king seems to have consisted
chiefly in his demesnes, which were large; and in the tolls and imposts which he
probably levied at discretion on the boroughs and sea-ports, that lay within his
demesnes. He could not alienate any part of the crown lands, even to religious
uses, without the consent of the states[n85]. Danegelt was a land-tax of a
shilling a hide, imposed by the |states[n86], either for payment of the sums
exacted by the Danes, or for putting the kingdom in a posture of defence against
those invaders [n87].

{#44} #Value of money.# ^The^ Saxon pound, as likewise that which was coined for
some centuries after the conquest, was near three times the weight of our
present money: There were forty-eight shillings in the pound, and five pence in
a shilling[n88], consequently a Saxon shilling was near a fifth heavier than
ours, and a Saxon penny near three times as heavy[n89]. As to the value of money
in those times, compared to commodities, there are some, though not very
certain, means of computation. A sheep by the laws of Athelstan was estimated at
a shilling; that is, fifteen-pence of our money. The fleece was two-fifths of
the value of the whole sheep[n90]; much above its present estimation; and the
reason probably was, that the Saxons, like the ancients, were little acquainted
with any clothing but what was made of wool. Silk and cotton were quite unknown:
Linen was not much used. An ox was computed at six times the value of a sheep; a
cow at four[n91]. If we suppose, that the cattle in that age, from the defects
in husbandry, were not so large as they are at present in England, we may
compute, that money was then near ten times of greater value. A horse was valued
at about thirty-six shillings of our money, or thirty Saxon shillings[n92]; a
mare a third less. A man at three pounds[n93]. The board-wages of a child the
first year was eight shillings, together with a cow's pasture in summer, and an
ox's in winter[n94]. William of Malmesbury mentions it as a remarkably high
price that William Rufus gave fifteen marks for a horse, or about thirty pounds
of our present money[n95]. Between the years 900 and 1000, Ednoth bought a hide
of land for about 118 shillings of present money[n96]. This was little more than
a shilling an acre, which indeed appears to have been the usual price, as we may
learn from other accounts[n97]. A palfrey was sold for twelve shillings about
the year 966[n98]. The value of an ox in king Ethelred's time was between seven
and eight shillings; a cow about six shillings[n99]. Gervas of Tilbury says,
that in Henry I.'s time, bread which would suffice a |hundred men for a day was
rated at three shillings, or a shilling of that age; for it is thought that soon
after the conquest a pound sterling was divided into twenty shillings: A sheep
was rated at a shilling, and so of other things in proportion. In Athelstan's
time a ram was valued at a shilling, or four-pence Saxon[n100]. The tenants of
Shireburn were obliged, at their choice, to pay either sixpence or four
hens[n101]. About 1232, the abbot of St. Albans, going on a journey, hired seven
handsome stout horses; and agreed, if any of them died on the road, to pay the
owner 30 shillings a piece of our present money[n102]. It is to be remarked,
that in all ancient times, the raising of corn, especially wheat, being a
species of manufactory, that commodity always bore a higher price, compared to
cattle, than it does in our times[n103]. The Saxon Chronicle tells us[n104],
that in the reign of Edward the Confessor there was the most terrible famine
ever known; in so much that a quarter of wheat rose to sixty pennies, or fifteen
shillings of our present money. Consequently it was as dear as if it now cost
seven pounds ten shillings. This much exceeds the great famine in the end of
queen Elizabeth; when a quarter of wheat was sold for four pounds. Money in this
last period was nearly of the same value as in our time. These severe famines
are a certain proof of bad husbandry.

{#45} ^On^ the whole, there are three things to be considered, wherever a sum of
money is mentioned in ancient times. First the change of denomination, by which
a pound has been reduced to the third part of its ancient weight in silver.
Secondly, the change in value by the greater plenty of money, which has reduced
the same weight of silver to ten times less value, compared to commodities; and
consequently a pound sterling to the thirtieth part of the ancient value.
Thirdly, the fewer people and less industry, which were then to be found in
every European kingdom. This circumstance made even the thirtieth part of the
sum more difficult to levy, and caused any sum to have more than thirty times
greater weight and influence both abroad and at home, than in our times; in the
same manner that a sum, a hundred thousand pounds for instance, is at present
more difficult to levy in a small state, such as Bavaria, and can produce
greater effects on such a small community, |than on England. This last
difference is not easy to be calculated: But allowing, that England has now six
times more industry, and three times more people than it had at the conquest and
for some reigns after that period, we are, upon that supposition, to conceive
taking all circumstances together, every sum of money mentioned by historians,
as if it were multiplied more than a hundred fold above a sum of the same
denomination at present.

{#46} ^In^ the Saxon times, land was divided equally among all the male-children
of the deceased, according to the custom of Gavelkind. The practice of entails
is to be found in those times[n105]. Land was chiefly of two kinds, bookland, or
land held by book or charter, which was regarded as full property, and defended
to the heirs of the possessor, and folkland, or the land held by the ceorles and
common people, who were removeable at pleasure, and were indeed only tenants
during the will of their lords.

{#47} ^The^ first attempt, which we find in England to separate the
ecclesiastical from the civil jurisdiction, was that law of Edgar, by which all
disputes among the clergy were ordered to be carried before the bishop[n106].
The pennances were then very severe; but as a man could buy them off with money,
or might substitute others to perform them, they lay easy upon the rich[n107].

{#48} #Manners.# ^With^ regard to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons we can say
little, but that they were in general a rude, uncultivated people, ignorant of
letters, unskilled in the mechanical arts, untamed to submission under law and
government, addicted to intemperance, riot, and disorder. Their best quality was
their military courage, which yet was not supported by discipline or conduct.
Their want of fidelity to the prince, or to any trust reposed in them, appears
strongly in the history of their later period; and their want of humanity in all
their history. Even the Norman historians, notwithstanding the low state of the
arts in their own country, speak of them as barbarians, when they mention the
invasion made upon them by the duke of Normandy[n108]. The conquest put the
people in a situation of receiving slowly, from abroad, the rudiments of science
and cultivation, and of correcting their rough and licentious manners.

{#n1} We know of one change, not inconsiderable in the Saxon constitution. The
Saxon Annals, p. 49. inform us, that it was in early times the prerogative of
the king to name the dukes, earls, aldermen and sheriffs of the counties. Asser,
a contemporary writer, informs us, that Alfred deposed all the ignorant
aldermen, and appointed men of more capacity in their place: Yet the laws of
Edward the Confessor, \S 35. say expressly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the
sheriffs were chosen by the freeholders in the folkmote, a county court, which
was assembled once a-year, and where all the freeholders swore allegiance to the
king.

{#n2} Sometimes abbesses were admitted; at least, they often sign the king's
charters or grants. Spellm. Gloss. in verbo _parliamentum._

{#n3} Wilkins passim.

{#n4} It appears from the ancient translations of the Saxon annals and laws, and
from king Alfred's translation of Bede, as well as from all the ancient
historians, that _comes_ in Latin, _alderman_ in Saxon, and _earl_ in Dano-Saxon
were quite synonimous. There is only a clause in a law of king Athelstan's, (see
Spelm. Conc. p. 406.) which has stumbled some antiquaries, and has made them
imagine that an earl was superior to an alderman. The weregild or the price of
an earl's blood is there fixed at 15,000 thrimsas, equal to that of an
archbishop; whereas that of a bishop and alderman is only 8000 thrimsas. To
solve this difficulty we must have recourse to Selden's conjecture, (see his
Titles of Honour, chap. v. p. 603, 604) that the term of earl was in the age of
Athelstan just beginning to be in use in England, and stood at that time for the
atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of
Canute, \S 55. where an atheling and an archbishop are put upon the same footing.
In another law of the same Athelstan the weregild of the prince or atheling is
said to be 15,000 thrimsas. See Wilkins, p. 71. He is therefore the same who is
called earl in the former law.

{#n6} There is some reason to think, that the bishops were sometimes chosen by
the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the king. Eddius, cap. 2. The abbots in the
monasteries of royal foundation were anciently named by the king; though Edgar
gave the monks the election, and only reserved to himself the ratification. This
destination was afterwards frequently violated; and the abbots as well as
bishops were afterwards all appointed by the king; as we learn from Ingulf, a
writer contemporary to the conquest.

offices hereditary, which took place, during a more early period, on the
continent; and which had already produced there its full effect.
