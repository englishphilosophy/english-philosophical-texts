{#1} THE king, #1679.# observing that the whole nation concurred at first in the
belief and prosecution of the popish plot, had found it necessary for his own
safety to pretend, in all public speeches and transactions, an entire belief and
acquiescence in that famous absurdity, and by this artifice he had eluded the
violent and irresistible torrent of the people. When a little time and
recollection, as well as the execution of the pretended conspirators, had
somewhat moderated the general fury, #State of parties.# he was now enabled to
form a considerable party, devoted to the interests of the crown, and determined
to oppose the pretensions of the malcontents.

{#2} ^In^ every mixed government, such as that of England, the bulk of the
nation will always incline to preserve the entire frame of the constitution; but
according to the various prejudices, interests, and |dispositions of men, some
will ever attach themselves with more passion to the regal, others to the
popular part of the government. Though the king, after his restoration, had
endeavoured to abolish the distinction of parties, and had chosen his ministers
from among all denominations; no sooner had he lost his popularity, and exposed
himself to general jealousy, than he found it necessary to court the old
cavalier party, and to promise them full compensation for that neglect, of which
they had hitherto complained. The present emergence made it still more necessary
for him to apply for their support; and there were many circumstances, which
determined them, at this time, to fly to the assistance of the crown, and to the
protection of the royal family.

{#3} ^A^ party, strongly attached to monarchy, will naturally be jealous of the
right of succession, by which alone, they believe, stability to be preserved in
the government, and a barrier fixed against the encroachments of popular
assemblies. The project, openly embraced, of excluding the duke, appeared to
that party a dangerous innovation: And the design, secretly projected, of
advancing Monmouth, made them apprehensive, lest the inconveniencies of a
disputed succession should be propagated to all posterity. While the jealous
lovers of liberty maintained, that a king, whose title depended on the
parliament, would naturally be more attentive to the interests, at least to the
humours of the people; the passionate admirers of monarchy considered all
dependance as a degradation of kingly government, and a great step towards the
establishment of a commonwealth in England.

{#4} ^But^ though his union with the political royalists brought great accession
of force to the king, he derived no less support from the confederacy, which he
had, at this time, the address to form with the church of England. He
represented to the ecclesiastics the great number of presbyterians and other
sectaries, who had entered into the popular party; the encouragement and favour
which they met with; the loudness of their cries with regard to popery and
arbitrary power. And he made the established clergy and their adherents
apprehend, that the old scheme for the abolition of prelacy as well as monarchy
was revived, and that the same miseries and oppressions awaited them, to which,
during the civil wars and usurpations, they had so long been exposed.

{#5} ^The^ memory also of those dismal times united many indifferent |and
impartial persons to the crown, and begat a dread lest the zeal for liberty
should engraft itself on fanaticism, and should once more kindle a civil war in
the kingdom. Had not the king still retained the prerogative of dissolving the
parliament, there was indeed reason to apprehend the renewal of all the
pretensions and violences, which had ushered in the last commotions. The one
period appeared an exact counter-part to the other: But still discerning judges
could perceive, both in the spirit of the parties and in the genius of the
prince, a material difference; by means of which Charles was enabled at last,
though with the imminent peril of liberty, to preserve the peace of the nation.

{#6} ^The^ cry against popery was loud; but it proceeded less from religious
than from party zeal, in those who propagated, and even in those who adopted it.
The spirit of enthusiasm had occasioned so much mischief, and had been so
successfully exploded, that it was not possible, by any artifice, again to
revive and support it. Cant had been ridiculed; hypocrisy detected; the
pretensions to a more thorough reformation, and to greater purity, had become
suspicious; and instead of denominating themselves the _godly_ party, the
appellation affected at the beginning of the civil wars, the present patriots
were content with calling themselves the _good_ and the _honest_ party[n1]: A
sure prognostic, that their measures were not to be so furious, nor their
pretensions so exorbitant.

{#7} ^The^ king too, though not endowed with the integrity and strict principles
of his father, was happy in a more amiable manner, and more popular address. Far
from being distant, stately, or reserved, he had not a grain of pride or vanity
in his whole composition[n2], but was the most affable, best bred man alive. He
treated his subjects like noblemen, like gentlemen, like freemen; not like
vassals or boors. His professions were plausible, his whole behaviour engaging;
so that he won upon the hearts, even while he lost the good opinion of his
subjects, and often balanced their judgment of things by their personal
inclination[n3]. In his public conduct likewise, though he had sometimes
embraced measures dangerous to the liberty and religion of his people, he had
never been found to persevere obstinately in them, but had always returned into
that |path, which their united opinion seemed to point out to him. And upon the
whole, it appeared to many cruel and even iniquitous, to remark too rigorously
the failings of a prince, who discovered so much facility in correcting his
errors, and so much lenity in pardoning the offences committed against himself.

{#8} ^The^ general affection, borne the king, appeared signally about this time.
He fell sick at Windsor; and had two or three fits of a fever, so violent as
made his life be thought in danger. A general consternation seized all ranks of
men, encreased by the apprehensions entertained of his successor. In the present
disposition of men's minds, the king's death, to use an expression of sir
William Temple[n4], was regarded as the end of the world. The malcontents, it
was feared, would proceed to extremities, and immediately kindle a civil war in
the kingdom. Either their entire success, or entire failure, or even the balance
and contest of parties, seemed all of them events equally fatal. The king's
chief counsellors, therefore, Essex, Halifax, and Sunderland, #State of the
ministry.# who stood on bad terms with Shaftesbury and the popular party,
advised him to send secretly for the duke, that, in case of any sinister
accident, that prince might be ready to assert his right against the opposition,
which he was likely to meet with. #2d Sept.# When the duke arrived, he found his
brother out of danger; and it was agreed to conceal the invitation, which he had
received. His journey, however, was attended with important consequences. He
prevailed on the king to disgrace Monmouth, whose projects were now known and
avowed; to deprive him of his command in the army; and to send him beyond sea.
He himself returned to Brussels; but made a short stay in that place. He
obtained leave to retire to Scotland, under pretence still of quieting the
apprehensions of the English nation; but in reality with a view of securing that
kingdom in his interests.

{#9} ^Though^ Essex and Halifax had concurred in the resolution of inviting over
the duke, they soon found, that they had not obtained his confidence, and that
even the king, while he made use of their service, had no sincere regard for
their persons. Essex in disgust resigned the treasury: Halifax retired to his
country-seat: Temple, despairing of any accommodation among such enraged
parties, withdrew almost entirely to his books and his gardens. The |king, who
changed ministers as well as measures with great indifference, bestowed at this
time his chief confidence on Hyde, Sunderland, and Godolphin. Hyde succeeded
Essex in the treasury.

{#10} ^All^ the king's ministers, as well as himself, were extremely averse to
the meeting of the new parliament, which they expected to find as refractory as
any of the preceding. The elections had gone mostly in favour of the country
party. The terrors of the plot had still a mighty influence over the populace;
and the apprehensions of the duke's bigoted principles and arbitrary character
weighed with men of sense and reflection. The king therefore resolved to
prorogue the parliament, that he might try, whether time would allay those
humours, which, by every other expedient, he had in vain attempted to mollify.
In this measure he did not expect the concurrence of his council. He knew, that
those popular leaders, whom he had admitted, would zealously oppose a
resolution, which disconcerted all their schemes; and that the royalists would
not dare, by supporting it, to expose themselves to the vengeance of the
parliament, when it should be assembled. These reasons obliged him to take this
step entirely of himself; and he only declared his resolution in council. It is
remarkable, that, though the king had made profession never to embrace any
measure without the advice of these counsellors, he had often broken that
resolution, and had been necessitated, in affairs of the greatest consequence,
to controul their opinion. Many of them in disgust threw up about this time;
particularly lord Russel, the most popular man in the nation, as well from the
mildness and integrity of his character, as from his zealous attachment to the
religion and liberties of his country. Though carried into some excesses, his
intentions were ever esteemed upright; and being heir to the greatest fortune in
the kingdom, as well as void of ambition, men believed, that nothing but the
last necessity could ever engage him to embrace any desperate measures.
Shaftesbury, who was, in most particulars, of an opposite character, was removed
by the king from the office of president of the council; and the earl of Radnor,
a man who possessed whimsical talents and splenetic virtues, was substituted in
his place.

{#11} ^It^ was the favour and countenance of the parliament, which had chiefly
encouraged the rumour of plots; but the nation had gotten so much into that vein
of credulity, and every necessitous |villain was so much incited by the success
of Oates and Bedloe, that, even during the prorogation, the people were not
allowed to remain in tranquillity. There was one Dangerfield, a fellow who had
been burned in the hand for crimes, transported, whipped, pilloried four times,
fined for cheats, outlawed for felony, convicted of coining, and exposed to all
the public infamy, which the laws could inflict on the basest and most shameful
enormities. The credulity of the people, and the humour of the times enabled
even this man to become a person of consequence. He was the author of a new
incident, #Meal-tub-plot.# called the meal-tub-plot, from the place where some
papers, relating to it, were found. The bottom of this affair it is difficult,
and not very material, to discover. It only appears, that Dangerfield, under
pretence of betraying the conspiracies of the presbyterians, had been
countenanced by some catholics of condition, and had even been admitted to the
duke's presence and the king's. And that under pretence of revealing new popish
plots, he had obtained access to Shaftesbury and some of the popular leaders.
Which side he intended to cheat, is uncertain; or whether he did not rather mean
to cheat both: But he soon found, that the belief of the nation was more open to
a popish than a presbyterian plot; and he resolved to strike in with the
prevailing humour. Though no weight could be laid on his testimony, great
clamour was raised; as if the court, by way of retaliation, had intended to load
the presbyterians with the guilt of a false conspiracy. It must be confessed,
that the present period, by the prevalence and suspicion of such mean and
ignoble arts on all sides, throws a great stain on the British annals.

{#12} #17th Nov.# ^One^ of the most innocent artifices, practised by party men
at this time, was the additional ceremony, pomp, and expence, with which a
pope-burning was celebrated in London: The spectacle served to entertain, and
amuse, and inflame the populace. The duke of Monmouth likewise came over without
leave, and made a triumphant procession through many parts of the kingdom,
extremely caressed and admired by the people. All these arts seemed requisite to
support the general prejudices, during the long interval of parliament. Great
endeavours were also used to obtain the king's consent for the meeting of that
assembly. #1680.# Seventeen peers presented a petition to this purpose. Many of
the corporations imitated the example. Notwithstanding several marks of
displeasure, |and even a menacing proclamation from the king, petitions came
from all parts, earnestly insisting on a session of parliament. The danger of
popery, and the terrors of the plot were never forgotten in any of these
addresses.

{#13} ^Tumultuous^ petitioning was one of the chief artifices by which the
malcontents in the last reign had attacked the crown: And though the manner of
subscribing and delivering petitions was now somewhat regulated by act of
parliament, the thing itself still remained; and was an admirable expedient for
infesting the court, for spreading discontent, and for uniting the nation in any
popular clamour. As the king found no law, by which he could punish those
importunate, and, as he deemed them, undutiful solicitations, he was obliged to
encounter them by popular applications of a contrary tendency. Wherever the
church and court party prevailed, addresses were framed, containing expressions
of the highest regard to his majesty, the most entire acquiescence in his
wisdom, the most dutiful submission to his prerogative, and the deepest
_abhorrence_ of those, who endeavoured to encroach upon it, by prescribing to
him any time for assembling the parliament. Thus the nation came to be
distinguished into _petitioners_ and _abhorrers._ Factions indeed were at this
time extremely animated against each other. The very names, by which each party
denominated its antagonist, discover the virulence and rancour, which prevailed.
For besides petitioner and abhorrer, appellations which were soon forgotten,
this year is remarkable for being the epoch of the well-known epithets of ^whig^
and ^tory^ , by which, #Whig and tory.# and sometimes without any material
difference, this island has been so long divided. The court party reproached
their antagonists with their affinity to the fanatical conventiclers in
Scotland, who were known by the name of whigs: The country party found a
resemblance between the courtiers and the popish banditti in Ireland, to whom
the appellation of tory was affixed. And after this manner, these foolish terms
of reproach came into public and general use; and even at present seem not
nearer their end than when they were first invented.

{#14} ^The^ king used every art to encourage his partizans, and to reconcile the
people to his government. He persevered in the great zeal which he affected
against popery. He even allowed several priests to be put to death, for no other
crime than their having |received orders in the Romish church. It is singular,
that one of them, called Evans, was playing at tennis, when the warrant for his
immediate execution was notified to him: He swore, that he would play out his
set first. Charles, with the same view of acquiring popularity, formed an
alliance with Spain, and also offered an alliance to Holland: But the Dutch,
terrified with the great power of France, and seeing little resource in a
country so distracted as England, declined acceptance. He had sent for the duke
from Scotland, but desired him to return, when the time of assembling the
parliament began to approach.

{#15} ^It^ was of great consequence to the popular party, while the meeting of
parliament depended on the king's will, to keep the law, whose operations are
perpetual, entirely on their side. The sheriffs of London by their office return
the juries: It had been usual for the mayor to nominate one sheriff by drinking
to him; and the common hall had ever without dispute confirmed the mayor's
choice. Sir Robert Clayton, the mayor, appointed one who was not acceptable to
the popular party: The common-hall rejected him; and Bethel and Cornish, two
independants, and republicans, and of consequence deeply engaged with the
malcontents, were chosen by a majority of voices. In spite of all remonstrances
and opposition, the citizens persisted in their choice; and the court party was
obliged for the present to acquiesce.

{#16} ^Juries^ however were not so partial in the city; but that reason and
justice, even when the popish plot was in question, could sometimes prevail. The
earl of Castlemaine, #23d June.# husband to the dutchess of Cleveland, was
acquitted about this time, though accused by Oates and Dangerfield of an
intention to assassinate the king. Sir Thomas Gascoigne, a very aged gentleman
in the north, being accused by two servants, whom he had dismissed for
dishonesty, received a like verdict. These trials were great blows to the plot,
which now began to stagger, in the judgment of most men, except those who were
entirely devoted to the country party. But in order still to keep alive the zeal
against popery, the earl of Shaftesbury appeared in Westminster-hall, attended
by the earl of Huntingdon, the lords Russel, Cavendish, Grey, Brandon, Sir Henry
Caverly, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Sir William Cooper, and other persons of
distinction, and presented to the grand jury of Middlesex reasons for indicting
the duke of York as a popish recusant. While |the jury were deliberating on this
extraordinary presentment, the chief justice sent for them, and suddenly, even
somewhat irregularly, dismissed them. Shaftesbury however obtained the end for
which he had undertaken this bold measure: He showed to all his followers the
desperate resolution, which he had embraced, never to admit of any accommodation
or composition with the duke. By such daring conduct he gave them assurance,
that he was fully determined not to desert their cause; and he engaged them to a
like devoted perseverance in all the measures, which he should suggest to them.

{#17} ^As^ the kingdom was regularly and openly divided into two zealous
parties, it was not difficult for the king to know, that the majority of the new
house of commons was engaged in interests opposite to the court: But that he
might leave no expedient untried, which could compose the unhappy differences
among his subjects, he resolved, #21st. Octob. A new parliament.# at last, after
a long interval, to assemble the parliament. In his speech, he told them, that
the several prorogations, which he had made, had been very advantageous to his
neighbours, and very useful to himself: That he had employed that interval in
perfecting with the crown of Spain an alliance, which had often been desired by
former parliaments, and which, he doubted not, would be extremely agreeable to
them: That, in order to give weight to this measure, and render it beneficial to
Christendom, it was necessary to avoid all domestic dissensions, and to unite
themselves firmly in the same views and purposes: That he was determined, that
nothing on his part should be wanting to such a salutary end; and provided the
succession were preserved in its due and legal course, he would concur in any
expedient for the security of the protestant religion: That the farther
examination of the popish plot and the punishment of the criminals were
requisite for the safety both of king and kingdom. And after recommending to
them the necessity of providing, by some supplies, for the safety of Tangiers,
he proceeded in these words: "But that which I value above all the treasure in
the world, and which I am sure will give us greater strength and reputation both
at home and abroad than any treasure can do, is a perfect union among ourselves.
Nothing but this can restore the kingdom to that strength and vigour which it
seems to have lost, and raise us again to that consideration, which England hath
usually possessed. All |Europe have their eyes upon this assembly, and think
their own happiness and misery, as well as ours, will depend upon it. If we
should be so unhappy as to fall into misunderstandings among ourselves to that
degree as would render our friendship unsafe to trust to, it will not be
wondered at, if our neighbours should begin to take new resolutions, and perhaps
such as may be fatal to us. Let us therefore take care, that we do not gratify
our enemies, and discourage our friends, by any unseasonable disputes. If any
such do happen, the world will see, that it is no fault of mine: For I have done
all that it was possible for me to do, to keep you in peace, while I live, and
to leave you so, when I die. But from so great prudence and so good affection as
yours, 1 can fear nothing of this kind; but do rely upon you all, that you will
do your best endeavours to bring this parliament to a good and happy
conclusion."

{#18} #Violence of the commons.# ^All^ these mollifying expressions had no
influence with the commons. Every step, which they took, betrayed the zeal, with
which they were animated. They voted, that it was the undoubted right of the
subject to petition the king for the calling and sitting of parliament. Not
content with this decision, which seems justifiable in a mixed monarchy, they
fell with the utmost violence on all those _abhorrers,_ who, in their addresses
to the crown, had expressed their disapprobation of those petitions. They did
not reflect, that it was as lawful for one party of men, as for another, to
express their sense of public affairs; and that the best established right may,
in particular circumstances, be abused, and even the exercise of it become an
object of abhorrence. For this offence, they expelled Sir Thomas Withens. They
appointed a committee for farther enquiry into such members as had been guilty
of a like crime; and complaints were lodged against lord Paston, Sir Robert
Malverer, Sir Bryan Stapleton, Taylor, and Turner. They addressed the king
against Sir George Jefferies, recorder of London, for his activity in the same
cause; and they frightened him into a resignation of his office, in which he was
succeeded by Sir George Treby, a great leader of the popular party. They voted
an impeachment against North, chief justice of the common pleas, for drawing the
proclamation against tumultuous petitions: But upon examination found the
proclamation so cautiously worded, that it afforded them no handle against him.
A petition had been |presented to the king from Taunton. "How dare you deliver
me such a paper?" said the king to the person who presented it. "Sir," replied
he, "my name is ^Dare.^ " For this saucy reply, but under other pretences, he
had been tried, fined, and committed to prison. The commons now addressed the
king for his liberty and for remitting his fine. Some printers also and authors
of seditious libels they took under their protection.

{#19} ^Great^ numbers of the abhorrers, from all parts of England, were seized
by order of the commons, and committed to custody. The liberty of the subject,
which had been so carefully guarded by the great charter, and by the late law of
habeas corpus, was every day violated by their arbitrary and capricious
commitments. The chief jealousy, it is true, of the English constitution is
naturally and justly directed against the crown; nor indeed have the commons any
other means of securing their privileges than by commitments, which, as they
cannot beforehand be exactly determined by law, must always appear in some
degree arbitrary. Sensible of these reasons, the people had hitherto, without
murmuring, seen this discretionary power exercised by the house: But as it was
now carried to excess, and was abused to serve the purposes of faction, great
complaints against it were heard from all quarters. At last, the vigour and
courage of one Stowel of Exeter, an abhorrer, put an end to the practice. He
refused to obey the serjeant at arms, stood upon his defence, and said that he
knew of no law, by which they pretended to commit him. The house, finding it
equally dangerous to proceed or to recede, got off by an evasion: They inserted
in their votes, that Stowel was indisposed, and that a month's time was allowed
him for the recovery of his health.

{#20} ^But^ the chief violence of the house of commons appeared in all their
transactions with regard to the plot, which they prosecuted with the same zeal
and the same credulity as their predecessors. They renewed the former vote,
which affirmed the reality of the horrid popish plot; and, in order the more to
terrify the people, they even asserted, that, notwithstanding the discovery, the
plot still subsisted. They expelled Sir Robert Can, and Sir Robert Yeomans, who
had been complained of, for saying, that there was no popish, but there was a
presbyterian plot. And they greatly lamented the death of Bedloe, whom they
called a material witness, and on whose testimony they much depended. He had
been seized |with a fever at Bristol; had sent for chief justice North;
confirmed all his former evidence, except that with regard to the duke and the
queen; and desired North to apply to the king for some money to relieve him in
his necessities. A few days after, he expired; and the whole party triumphed
extremely in these circumstances of his death: As if such a testimony could be
deemed the affirmation of a dying man, as if his confession of perjury in some
instances could assure his veracity in the rest, and as if the perseverance of
one profligate could outweigh the last words of so many men, guilty of no crime
but that of popery.

{#21} ^The^ commons even endeavoured, by their countenance and protection, to
remove the extreme infamy, with which Dangerfield was loaded, and to restore him
to the capacity of being an evidence. The whole tribe of informers they
applauded and rewarded: Jennison, Turberville, Dugdale, Smith, la Faria,
appeared before them; and their testimony, however frivolous or absurd, met with
a favourable reception: The king was applied to in their behalf for pensions and
pardons: Their narratives were printed with that sanction, which arose from the
approbation of the house: Dr. Tongue was recommended for the first considerable
church preferment, which should become vacant. Considering men's determined
resolution to believe, instead of admiring that a palpable falshood should be
maintained by witnesses, it may justly appear wonderful, that no better evidence
was ever produced against the catholics.

{#22} ^The^ principal reasons, which still supported the clamour of the popish
plot, were the apprehensions entertained by the people, of the duke of York, and
the resolution, embraced by their leaders, of excluding him from the throne.
#Exclusion-bill.# Shaftesbury and many considerable men of the party, had
rendered themselves irreconcileable with him, and could find their safety no way
but in his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped, that the exclusion of that prince
would make way for their patron. The resentment against the duke's apostacy, the
love of liberty, the zeal for religion, the attachment to faction; all these
motives incited the country party. And above all, what supported the resolution
of adhering to the exclusion, and rejecting all other expedients offered, was
the hope artfully encouraged, that the king would at last be obliged to yield to
their demand. His revenues were extremely burdened; and even if free, |could
scarcely suffice for the necessary charges of government, much less for that
pleasure and expence, to which he was inclined. Though he had withdrawn his
countenance from Monmouth, he was known secretly to retain a great affection for
him. On no occasion had he ever been found to persist obstinately against
difficulties and importunity. And as his beloved mistress, the dutchess of
Portsmouth, had been engaged, either from lucrative views, or the hopes of
making the succession fall on her own children, to unite herself with the
popular party; this incident was regarded as a favourable prognostic of their
success. Sunderland, secretary of state, who had linked his interest with that
of the dutchess, had concurred in the same measure.

{#23} ^But^ besides friendship for his brother and a regard to the right of
succession, there were many strong reasons, which had determined Charles to
persevere in opposing the exclusion. All the royalists and the devotees to the
church; that party by which alone monarchy was supported; regarded the right of
succession as inviolable; and if abandoned by the king in so capital an article,
it was to be feared, that they would, in their turn, desert his cause, and
deliver him over to the pretensions and usurpations of the country party. The
country party, or the whigs, as they were called, if they did not still retain
some propensity towards a republic, were at least affected with a violent
jealousy of regal power; and it was equally to be dreaded, that, being enraged
with past opposition and animated by present success, they would, if they
prevailed in this pretension, be willing as well as able, to reduce the
prerogative within very narrow limits. All menaces therefore, all promises were
in vain employed against the king's resolution: He never would be prevailed on
to desert his friends, and put himself into the hands of his enemies. And having
voluntarily made such important concessions, and tendered, over and over again,
such strong limitations, he was well pleased to find them rejected by the
obstinacy of the commons; and hoped, that, after the spirit of opposition had
spent itself in fruitless violence, the time would come, when he might safely
appeal against his parliament to his people.

{#24} ^So^ much were the popular leaders determined to carry matters to
extremities, that in less than a week after the commencement of the session, a
motion was made for bringing in an exclusion-bill, and a committee was appointed
for that purpose. This bill differed |in nothing from the former, but in two
articles, which showed still an encrease of zeal in the commons: The bill was to
be read to the people twice a-year in all the churches of the kingdom, and every
one, who should support the duke's title was rendered incapable of receiving a
pardon but by act of parliament.

{#25} ^The^ debates were carried on with great violence on both sides. The bill
was defended by Sir William Jones, who had now resigned his office of
attorney-general, by lord Russel, by Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry Capel,
Sir William Pulteney, by colonel Titus, Treby, Hambden, Montague. #10th Nov.# It
was opposed by Sir Leoline Jenkins, secretary of state, Sir John Ernley,
chancellor of the exchequer, by Hyde, Seymour, Temple. The arguments,
transmitted to us, may be reduced to the following topics.

{#26} #Arguments for and against the exclusion.# ^In^ every government, said the
exclusionists, there is somewhere an authority absolute and supreme; nor can any
determination, how unusual soever, which receives the sanction of the
legislature, admit afterwards of dispute or controul. The liberty of a
constitution, so far from diminishing this absolute power, seems rather to add
force to it, and to give it greater influence over the people. The more members
of the state concur in any legislative decision, and the more free their voice;
the less likelihood is there, that any opposition will be made to those
measures, which receive the final sanction of their authority. In England, the
legislative power is lodged in king, lords, and commons, which comprehend every
order of the community: And there is no pretext for exempting any circumstance
of government, not even the succession of the crown, from so full and decisive a
jurisdiction. Even express declarations have, in this particular, been made of
parliamentary authority: Instances have occurred, where it has been exerted: And
though prudential reasons may justly be alledged, why such innovations should
not be attempted but on extraordinary occasions, the power and right are for
ever vested in the community. But if any occasion can be deemed extraordinary,
if any emergence can require unusual expedients, it is the present; when the
heir to the crown has renounced the religion of the state, and has zealously
embraced a faith, totally hostile and incompatible. A prince of that communion
can never put trust in a people, so prejudiced against him: The people must be
equally diffident of such a prince: Foreign and destructive alliances will seem
to one |the only protection of his throne: Perpetual jealousy, opposition,
faction, even insurrections will be employed by the other as the sole securities
for their liberty and religion. Though theological principles, when set in
opposition to passions, have often small influence on mankind in general, still
less on princes; yet when they become symbols of faction, and marks of party
distinctions, they concur with one of the strongest passions in the human frame,
and are then capable of carrying men to the greatest extremities.
Notwithstanding the better judgment and milder disposition of the king; how much
has the influence of the duke already disturbed the tenor of government? How
often engaged the nation into measures totally destructive of their foreign
interests and honour, of their domestic repose and tranquillity? The more the
absurdity and incredibility of the popish plot are insisted on, the stronger
reason it affords for the exclusion of the duke; since the universal belief of
it discovers the extreme antipathy of the nation to his religion, and the utter
impossibility of ever bringing them to acquiesce peaceably under the dominion of
such a sovereign. The prince, finding himself in so perilous a situation, must
seek for security by desperate remedies, and by totally subduing the privileges
of a nation, which had betrayed such hostile dispositions towards himself, and
towards every thing which he deems the most sacred. It is in vain to propose
limitations and expedients. Whatever share of authority is left in the duke's
hands, will be employed to the destruction of the nation; and even the
additional restraints, by discovering the public diffidence and aversion, will
serve him as incitements to put himself in a condition entirely superior and
independant. And as the laws of England still make resistance treason, and
neither do nor can admit of any positive exceptions; what folly to leave the
kingdom in so perilous and absurd a situation; where the greatest virtue will be
exposed to the most severe proscription, and where the laws can only be saved by
expedients, which these same laws have declared the highest crime and enormity?

{#27} ^The^ court party reasoned in an opposite manner. An authority, they said,
wholly absolute and uncontroulable is a mere chimera, and is no where to be
found in any human institutions. All government is founded on opinion and a
sense of duty; and wherever the supreme magistrate, by any law or positive
prescription, shocks an |opinion regarded as fundamental, and established with a
firmness equal to that of his own authority, he subverts the principle, by which
he himself is established, and can no longer hope for obedience. In European
monarchies, the right of succession is justly esteemed a fundamental; and even
though the whole legislature be vested in a single person, it would never be
permitted him by an edict, to disinherit his lawful heir, and call a stranger or
more distant relation to the throne. Abuses in other parts of government are
capable of redress, from more dispassionate enquiry or better information of the
sovereign, and till then ought patiently to be endured: But violations of the
right of succession draw such terrible consequences after them as are not to be
paralleled by any other grievance or inconvenience. Vainly is it pleaded, that
England is a mixed monarchy; and that a law, assented to by king, lords, and
commons, is enacted by the concurrence of every part of the state: It is plain,
that there remains a very powerful party, who may indeed be out-voted, but who
never will deem a law, subversive of hereditary right, any wise valid or
obligatory. Limitations, such as are proposed by the king, give no shock to the
constitution, which, in many particulars, is already limited; and they may be so
calculated as to serve every purpose, sought for by an exclusion. If the ancient
barriers against regal authority have been able, during so many ages, to remain
impregnable; how much more, those additional ones, which, by depriving the
monarch of power, tend so far to their own security? The same jealousy too of
religion, which has engaged the people to lay these restraints upon the
successor, will extremely lessen the number of his partizans, and make it
utterly impracticable for him, either by force or artifice, to break the
fetters, imposed upon him. The king's age and vigorous state of health promise
him a long life: And can it be prudent to tear in pieces the whole state, in
order to provide against a contingency, which, it is very likely, may never
happen? No human schemes can secure the public in all possible, imaginable,
events; and the bill of exclusion itself, however accurately framed, leaves room
for obvious and natural suppositions, to which it pretends not to provide any
remedy. Should the duke have a son, after the king's death must that son,
without any default of his own, forfeit his title? or must the princess of
Orange descend from the throne, in order to give place to the lawful |successor?
But were all these reasonings false, it still remains to be considered, that, in
public deliberations, we seek not the expedient, which is best in itself, but
the best of such as are practicable. The king willingly consents to limitations,
and has already offered some which are of the utmost importance: But he is
determined to endure any extremity rather than allow the right of succession to
be invaded. Let us beware of that factious violence, which leads to demand more
than will be granted; lest we lose the advantage of those beneficial
concessions, and leave the nation, on the king's demise, at the mercy of a
zealous prince, irritated with the ill usage, which, he imagines, he has already
met with.

{#28} ^In^ the house of commons, the reasoning of the exclusionists appeared the
more convincing; and the bill passed by a great majority. It was in the house of
peers that the king expected to oppose it with success. The court party was
there so prevalent, that it was carried only by a majority of two to pay so much
regard to the bill as even to commit it. When it came to be debated, the contest
was violent. #15th Nov.# Shaftesbury, Sunderland, and Essex argued for it:
Halifax chiefly conducted the debate against it, and displayed an extent of
capacity and a force of eloquence, which had never been surpassed in that
assembly. He was animated, as well by the greatness of the occasion, as by a
rivalship with his uncle Shaftesbury; whom, during that day's debate, he seemed,
in the judgment of all, to have totally eclipsed. The king was present during
the whole debate, which was prolonged till eleven at night. The bill was thrown
out by a considerable majority. #Exclusion bill rejected.# All the bishops,
except three, voted against it. Besides the influence of the court over them;
the church of England, they imagined or pretended, was in greater danger from
the prevalence of presbyterianism than of popery, which, though favoured by the
duke, and even by the king, was extremely repugnant to the genius of the nation.

{#29} ^The^ commons discovered much ill humour upon this disappointment. They
immediately voted an address for the removal of Halifax from the king's councils
and presence for ever. Though the pretended cause was his advising the late
frequent prorogations of parliament, the real reason was apparently his vigorous
opposition to the exclusion-bill. When the king applied for money to enable him
to maintain Tangiers, which he declared his present revenues totally unable to
defend; instead of complying, |they voted such an address as was in reality a
remonstrance, and one little less violent than that famous remonstrance, which
ushered in the civil wars. All the abuses of government, from the beginning
almost of the reign, are there insisted on; the Dutch war, the alliance with
France, the prorogations and dissolutions of parliament; and as all these
measures, as well as the _damnable_ and _hellish_ plot, are there ascribed to
the machinations of papists, it was plainly insinuated, that the king had, all
along, lain under the influence of that party, and was in reality the chief
conspirator against the religion and liberties of his people.

{#30} ^The^ commons, though they conducted the great business of the exclusion
with extreme violence and even imprudence, had yet much reason for the jealousy,
which gave rise to it: But their vehement prosecution of the popish plot even
after so long an interval, discovers such a spirit, either of credulity or
injustice, as admits of no apology. The impeachment of the catholic lords in the
Tower was revived; and as viscount Stafford, from his age, infirmities, and
narrow capacity, was deemed the least capable of defending himself, it was
determined to make him the first victim, that his condemnation might pave the
way for a sentence against the rest. #30th Nov.# The chancellor, now created
earl of Nottingham, was appointed high steward for conducting the trial.

{#31} ^Three^ witnesses were produced against the prisoner; Oates, Dugdale, and
Turberville. #Trial of Stafford, and execution.# Oates swore, that he saw
Fenwic, the jesuit, deliver to Stafford a commission signed by de Oliva, general
of the jesuits, appointing him pay-master to the papal army, which was to be
levied for the subduing of England: For this ridiculous imposture still
maintained its credit with the commons. Dugdale gave testimony, that the
prisoner, at Tixal, a seat of lord Aston's, had endeavoured to engage him in the
design of murdering the king; and had promised him, besides the honour of being
sainted by the church, a reward of 500 pounds for that service. Turberville
deposed, that the prisoner, in his own house at Paris, had made him a like
proposal. To offer money for murdering a king, without laying down any scheme,
by which the assassin may insure some probability or possibility of escape, is
so incredible in itself, and may so easily be maintained by any prostitute
evidence, that an accusation of that nature, not accompanied with circumstances,
ought very little to be attended to by any court of judicature. But
|notwithstanding the small hold, which the witnesses afforded, the prisoner was
able in many material particulars, to discredit their testimony. It was sworn by
Dugdale, that Stafford had assisted in a great consult of the catholics held at
Tixal; but Stafford proved by undoubted testimony, that at the time assigned he
was in Bath, and in that neighbourhood. Turberville had served a noviciate among
the Dominicans; but having deserted the convent, he had enlisted as a trooper in
the French army; and being dismissed that service, he now lived in London,
abandoned by all his relations, and exposed to great poverty. Stafford proved,
by the evidence of his gentleman and his page, that Turberville had never,
either at Paris or at London, been seen in his company; and it might justly
appear strange, that a person, who had so important a secret in his keeping, was
so long entirely neglected by him.

{#32} ^The^ clamour and outrage of the populace, during the trial, were extreme:
Great abilities and eloquence were displayed by the managers, Sir William Jones,
Sir Francis Winnington, and serjeant Maynard: Yet did the prisoner, under all
these disadvantages, make a better defence than was expected, either by his
friends or his enemies: The unequal contest, in which he was engaged, was a
plentiful source of compassion to every mind, seasoned with humanity. He
represented, that, during a course of forty years, from the very commencement of
the civil wars, he had, through many dangers, difficulties and losses, still
maintained his loyalty: And was it credible, that now, in his old age, easy in
his circumstances, but dispirited by infirmities, he would belye the whole
course of his life, and engage against his royal master, from whom he had ever
received kind treatment, in the most desperate and most bloody of all
conspiracies? He remarked the infamy of the witnesses; the contradictions and
absurdities of their testimony; the extreme indigence in which they had lived,
though engaged, as they pretended, in a conspiracy with kings, princes, and
nobles; the credit and opulence to which they were at present raised. With a
simplicity and tenderness more persuasive than the greatest oratory, he still
made protestations of his innocence, and could not forbear, every moment,
expressing the most lively surprize and indignation at the audacious impudence
of the witnesses.

{#33} ^It^ will appear astonishing to us, as it did to Stafford himself, that
the peers, after a solemn trial of six days, should, by a majority |of
twenty-four voices, give sentence against him. He received however with
resignation the fatal verdict. _God's holy name be praised,_ was the only
exclamation which he uttered. When the high-steward told him, that the peers
would intercede with the king for remitting the more cruel and ignominious parts
of the sentence, hanging and quartering; he burst into tears: But he told the
lords, that he was moved to this weakness, by his sense of their goodness, not
by any terror of that fate, which he was doomed to suffer.

{#34} ^It^ is remarkable, that, after Charles, as is usual in such cases, had
remitted to Stafford the hanging and quartering, the two sheriffs, Bethel and
Cornish, indulging their own republican humour, and complying with the prevalent
spirit of their party, ever jealous of monarchy, started a doubt with regard to
the king's power of exercising even this small degree of lenity. "Since he
cannot pardon the whole," said they, "how can he have power to remit any part of
the sentence?" They proposed the doubt to both houses: The peers pronounced it
superfluous; and even the commons, apprehensive lest a question of this nature
might make way for Stafford's escape, gave this singular answer. "This house is
_content,_ that the sheriffs do execute William late viscount Stafford by
severing his head from his body _only._" Nothing can be a stronger proof of the
fury of the times, than that lord Russel, notwithstanding the virtue and
humanity of his character, seconded in the house this barbarous scruple of the
sheriffs.

{#35} ^In^ the interval between the sentence and execution, many efforts were
made to shake the resolution of the infirm and aged prisoner, and to bring him
to some confession of the treason, for which he was condemned. It was even
rumoured, that he had confessed; and the zealous partymen, who, no doubt, had
secretly, notwithstanding their credulity, entertained some doubts with regard
to the reality of the popish conspiracy, expressed great triumph on the
occasion. But Stafford, when again called before the house of peers, discovered
many schemes, which had been laid by himself and others for procuring a
toleration to the catholics, at least a mitigation of the penal laws, enacted
against them: And he protested, that this was the sole treason, of which he had
ever been guilty.

{#36} ^Stafford^ now prepared himself for death with the intrepidity, which
became his birth and station, and which was the natural |result of the innocence
and integrity, which, during the course of a long life, he had ever maintained:
His mind seemed even to collect new force from the violence and oppression,
under which he laboured. #29th Dec.# When going to execution, he called for a
cloak to defend him against the rigour of the season. "Perhaps," said he, "I may
shake with cold; but, I trust in God, not for fear." On the scaffold, he
continued, with reiterated and earnest asseverations, to make protestations of
his innocence: All his fervour was exercised on that point: When he mentioned
the witnesses, whose perjuries had bereaved him of life, his expressions were
full of mildness and of charity. He solemnly disavowed all those immoral
principles, which over-zealous protestants had ascribed without distinction to
the church of Rome: And he hoped, he said, that the time was now approaching,
when the present delusion would be dissipated; and when the force of truth,
though late, would engage the whole world to make reparation to his injured
honour.

{#37} ^The^ populace, who had exulted at Stafford's trial and condemnation, were
now melted into tears, at the sight of that tender fortitude, which shone forth
in each feature, and motion, and accent of this aged noble. Their profound
silence was only interrupted by sighs and groans. With difficulty they found
speech to assent to those protestations of innocence, which he frequently
repeated: "We believe you, my lord! God bless you, my lord!" These expressions
with a faultering accent flowed from them. The executioner himself was touched
with sympathy. Twice he lifted up the ax, with an intent to strike the fatal
blow; and as often felt his resolution to fail him. A deep sigh was heard to
accompany his last effort, which laid Stafford for ever at rest. All the
spectators seemed to feel the blow. And when the head was held up to them with
the usual cry, _This is the head of a traitor,_ no clamour of assent was
uttered. Pity, remorse, and astonishment had taken possession of every heart,
and displayed itself in every countenance.

{#38} ^This^ is the last blood which was shed on account of the popish plot: An
incident, which, for the credit of the nation, it were better to bury in eternal
oblivion; but which it is necessary to perpetuate, as well to maintain the truth
of history, as to warn, if possible, their posterity and all mankind never again
to fall into so shameful, so barbarous a delusion.

{#39} ^The^ execution of Stafford gratified the prejudices of the country
|party; but it contributed nothing to their power and security: On the contrary,
by exciting commiseration, it tended still farther to encrease that disbelief of
the whole plot, which began now to prevail. The commons, therefore, not to lose
the present opportunity, resolved to make both friends and enemies sensible of
their power. They passed a bill for easing the protestant dissenters, and for
repealing the persecuting statute of the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth: This
laudable bill was likewise carried through the house of peers. The chief justice
was very obnoxious for dismissing the grand jury in an irregular manner, and
thereby disappointing that bold measure of Shaftesbury and his friends, who had
presented the duke as a recusant. For this crime the commons sent up an
impeachment against him; as also against Jones and Weston, two of the judges,
who, in some speeches from the bench, had gone so far as to give to many of the
first reformers the appellation of fanatics.

{#40} ^The^ king, in rejecting the exclusion bill, had sheltered himself
securely behind the authority of the house of peers; and the commons had been
deprived of the usual pretence, to attack the sovereign himself, under colour of
attacking his ministers and counsellors. In prosecution however of the scheme,
which he had formed, of throwing the blame on the commons in case of any
rupture, he made them a new speech. After warning them, that a neglect of this
opportunity would never be retrieved, he added these words: "I did promise you
the fullest satisfaction, which your hearts could wish, for the security of the
protestant religion, and to concur with you in any remedies, which might consist
with preserving the succession of the crown in its due and legal course of
descent. I do again, with the same reservations, renew the same promises to you:
And being thus ready on my part to do all that can reasonably be expected from
me, I should be glad to know from you, as soon as may be, how far I shall be
assisted by you, and what it is you desire from me."

{#41} ^The^ most reasonable objection against the limitations, proposed by the
king, is, that they introduced too considerable an innovation in the government,
and almost totally annihilated the power of the future monarch. But considering
the present disposition of the commons and their leaders, we may fairly presume,
that this objection would have small weight with them, and that their |disgust
against the court would rather incline them to diminish than support regal
authority. They still hoped, from the king's urgent necessities and his usual
facility, that he would throw himself wholly into their hands; and that thus,
without waiting for the accession of the duke, they might immediately render
themselves absolute masters of the government. #Violence of the commons.# The
commons, therefore, besides insisting still on the exclusion, proceeded to bring
in bills of an important, and some of them of an alarming nature: One to renew
the triennial act, which had been so inadvertently repealed in the beginning of
the reign: A second to make the office of judge during good behaviour: A third
to declare the levying of money without consent of parliament to be high
treason: A fourth to order an association for the safety of his majesty's
person, for defence of the protestant religion, for the preservation of the
protestant subjects against all invasions and opposition whatsoever, and for
preventing the duke of York or any papist from succeeding to the crown. The
memory of the covenant was too recent for men to overlook the consequences of
such an association: And the king, who was particularly conversant in Davila,
could not fail of recollecting a memorable foreign instance, to fortify this
domestic experience.

{#42} ^The^ commons also passed many votes, which, though they had not the
authority of laws, served however to discover the temper and disposition of the
house. They voted, that whoever had advised his majesty to refuse the exclusion
bill, were promoters of popery and enemies to the king and kingdom. In another
vote, they named the marquess of Worcester, the earls of Clarendon, Feversham,
and Halifax, Laurence Hyde, and Edward Seymour, as those dangerous enemies; and
they requested his majesty to remove them from his person and councils for ever:
They voted, that, till the exclusion bill were passed, they could not,
consistent with the trust reposed in them, grant the king any manner of supply.
And lest he should be enabled, by any other expedient, to support the
government, and preserve himself independant, they passed another vote, in which
they declared, that whoever should hereafter lend, by way of advance, any money
upon those branches of the king's revenue, arising from customs, excise, or
hearth money, should be judged a hinderer of the sitting of parliament, and be
responsible for the same in parliament.

{#43} ^The^ king might presume, that the peers, who had rejected the exclusion
bill, would still continue to defend the throne, and that none of the dangerous
bills, introduced into the other house, would ever be presented for the royal
assent and approbation. But as there remained no hopes of bringing the commons
to any better temper, and as their farther sitting served only to keep faction
alive, and to perpetuate the general ferment of the nation, he came secretly to
a resolution of proroguing them. #1681. 10th Jan.Dissolution of the parliament.#
They got intelligence about a quarter of an hour before the black rod came to
their door. Not to lose such precious time, they passed in a tumultuous manner
some extraordinary resolutions. They voted, _that_ whosoever advised his majesty
to prorogue this parliament to any other purpose than in order to pass the bill
of exclusion, was a betrayer of the king, of the protestant religion, and of the
kingdom of England; a promoter of the French interest, and a pensioner of
France: _That_ thanks be given to the city of London for their manifest loyalty,
and for their care and vigilance in the preservation of the king and of the
protestant religion: _That_ it is the opinion of this house, that that city was
burned in the year 1666 by the papists, designing thereby to introduce arbitrary
power and popery into the kingdom: _That_ humble application be made to his
majesty for restoring the duke of Monmouth to all his offices and commands, from
which, it appears to the house, he had been removed by the influence of the duke
of York. And _that_ it is the opinion of the house that the prosecution of the
protestant dissenters upon the penal laws is at this time grievous to the
subject, a weakening of the protestant interest, an encouragement of popery, and
dangerous to the peace of the kingdom.

{#44} ^The^ king passed some laws of no great importance: But the bill for
repealing the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth, he privately ordered the clerk of the
crown not to present to him. By this artifice, which was equally disobliging to
the country party as if the bill had been rejected, and at the same time implied
some timidity in the king, that salutary act was for the present eluded. The
king had often of himself attempted, and sometimes by irregular means, to give
indulgence to nonconformists: But besides that he had usually expected to
comprehend the catholics in this liberty, the present refractory disposition of
the sectaries had much incensed him against them; and he was resolved, if
possible, to keep them still at mercy.

{#45} ^The^ last votes of the commons seemed to be an attempt of forming
indirectly an association against the crown, after they found, that their
association bill could not pass: The dissenting interest, the city, and the duke
of Monmouth, they endeavoured to connect with the country party. A civil war
indeed never appeared so likely as at present; and it was high time for the king
to dissolve a parliament, which seemed to have entertained such dangerous
projects. Soon after, he summoned another. Though he observed, that the country
party had established their interest so strongly in all the electing burroughs,
that he could not hope for any disposition more favourable in the new
parliament, this expedient was still a prosecution of his former project, of
trying every method, by which he might form an accommodation with the commons:
And if all failed, he hoped, that he could the better justify to his people, at
least to his party, a final breach with them.

{#46} ^It^ had always been much regretted by the royalists, during the civil
wars, that the long parliament had been assembled at Westminster, and had
thereby received force and encouragement from the vicinity of a potent and
factious city, which had zealously embraced their party. Though the king was now
possessed of guards, which in some measure overawed the populace, he was
determined still farther to obviate all inconveniencies; and he summoned the new
parliament to meet at Oxford. The city of London showed how just a judgment he
had formed of their dispositions. Besides re-electing the same members, they
voted thanks to them for their former behaviour, in endeavouring to discover the
depth of the _horrid_ and _hellish_ popish plot, and to exclude the duke of
York, the principal cause of the ruin and misery, impending over the nation.
Monmouth with fifteen peers presented a petition against assembling the
parliament at Oxford, "where the two houses," they said, "could not be in
safety; but would be easily exposed to the swords of the papists and their
adherents, of whom too many had creeped into his majesty's guards." These
insinuations, which pointed so evidently at the king himself, were not
calculated to persuade him, but to inflame the people.

{#47} ^The^ exclusionists might have concluded, both from the king's dissolution
of the last parliament, and from his summoning of the present to meet at Oxford,
that he was determined to maintain his declared resolution of rejecting their
favourite bill: But they still flattered themselves, that his urgent necessities
would influence |his easy temper, and finally gain them the ascendant. The
leaders came to parliament, attended not only by their servants, but by numerous
bands of their partizans. The four city members in particular were followed by
great multitudes, wearing ribbons, in which were woven these words, _No popery!
No slavery!_ The king had his guards regularly mustered: His party likewise
endeavoured to make a show of their strength: And on the whole, the assembly at
Oxford rather bore the appearance of a tumultuous Polish diet, than of a regular
English parliament.

{#48} #21st. March.# ^The^ king, who had hitherto employed the most gracious
expressions to all his parliaments, particularly the two last, thought proper to
address himself to the present in a more authoritative manner. He complained of
the unwarrantable proceedings of the former house of commons; and said, that, as
he would never use arbitrary government himself, neither would he ever suffer it
in others. #New parliament at Oxford.# By calling, however, this parliament so
soon, he had sufficiently shown, that no past irregularities could inspire him
with a prejudice against those assemblies. He now afforded them, he added, yet
another opportunity of providing for the public safety; and to all the world had
given one evidence more, that on his part he had not neglected the duty
incumbent on him.

{#49} ^The^ commons were not over-awed by the magisterial air of the king's
speech. They consisted almost entirely of the same members; they chose the same
speaker; and they instantly fell into the same measures, the impeachment of
Danby, the repeal of the persecuting statute of Elizabeth, the enquiry into the
popish plot, and the bill of exclusion. So violent were they on this last
article, that no other expedient, however plausible, could so much as be
hearkened to. Ernley, one of the king's ministers, proposed, that the duke
should be banished, during life, five hundred miles from England, and that on
the king's demise the next heir should be constituted regent with regal power:
Yet even this expedient, which left the duke only the bare title of king, could
not, though seconded by Sir Thomas Lyttleton and Sir Thomas Mompesson, obtain
the attention of the house. The past disappointments of the country party, and
the opposition made by the court, had only rendered them more united, more
haughty, and more determined. No method but their own, of excluding the duke,
could give them any satisfaction.

{#50} #Fitz-harris's case.# ^There^ was one Fitz-harris, an Irish catholic, who
had insinuated himself into the dutchess of Portsmouth's acquaintance, and had
been very busy in conveying to her intelligence of any libel written by the
country party, or of any designs entertained against her or against the court.
For services of this kind, and perhaps too, from a regard to his father, Sir
Edward Fitz-harris, who had been an eminent royalist, he had received from the
king a present of 250 pounds. This man met with one Everard, a Scotchman, a spy
of the exclusionists, and an informer concerning the popish plot; and he engaged
him to write a libel against the king, the duke, and the whole administration.
What Fitz-harris's intentions were, cannot well be ascertained: It is probable,
as he afterwards asserted, that he meant to carry this libel to his patron, the
dutchess, and to make a merit of the discovery. Everard, who suspected some
other design, and who was well pleased on his side to have the merit of a
discovery with his patrons, resolved to betray his friend: He posted Sir William
Waller, a noted justice of peace, and two persons more behind the hangings, and
gave them an opportunity of seeing and hearing the whole transaction. The libel,
sketched out by Fitz-harris, and executed partly by him, partly by Everard, was
the most furious, indecent, and outrageous performance imaginable; and such as
was fitter to hurt than serve any party, which should be so imprudent as to
adopt it. Waller carried the intelligence to the king, and obtained a warrant
for committing Fitz-harris, who happened, at that very time, to have a copy of
the libel in his pocket. Finding himself now delivered over to the law, he
resolved to pay court to the popular party, who were alone able to protect him,
and by whom he observed almost all trials to be governed and directed. He
affirmed, that he had been employed by the court to write the libel, in order to
throw the odium of it on the exclusionists: But this account, which was within
the bounds of credibility, he disgraced by circumstances, which are altogether
absurd and improbable. The intention of the ministers, he said, was to send
about copies to all the heads of the country party; and the moment they received
them, they were to be arrested, and a conspiracy to be imputed to them. That he
might merit favour by still more important intelligence, he commenced a
discoverer of the great popish plot; and he failed not to confirm all the
tremendous circumstances, insisted on by his predecessors. He said, that the
second Dutch war was |entered into with a view of extirpating the protestant
religion, both abroad and at home; that father Parry, a jesuit, on the
disappointment by the peace, told him, that the catholics resolved to murder the
king, and had even engaged the queen in that design: that the envoy of Modena
offered him 10,000 pounds to kill the king, and upon his refusal the envoy said,
that the duchess of Mazarine, who was as expert at poisoning as her sister, the
countess of Soissons, would, with a little phial, execute that design; that upon
the king's death the army in Flanders was to come over, and massacre the
protestants; that money was raised in Italy for recruits and supplies, and there
should be no more parliaments; and that the duke was privy to this whole plan,
and had even entered into the design of Godfrey's murder, which was executed in
the manner related by Prance.

{#51} ^The^ popular leaders had, all along, been very desirous of having an
accusation against the duke; and though Oates and Bedloe, in their first
evidence, had not dared to go so far, both Dugdale and Dangerfield had
afterwards been encouraged to supply so material a defect, by comprehending him
in the conspiracy. The commons, therefore, finding that Fitz-harris was also
willing to serve this purpose, were not ashamed to adopt his evidence, and
resolved for that end to save him from the destruction, with which he was at
present threatened. The king had removed him from the city-prison, where he was
exposed to be tampered with by the exclusionists; had sent him to the Tower; and
had ordered him to be prosecuted by an indictment at common law. In order to
prevent his trial and execution, an impeachment was voted by the commons against
him, and sent up to the lords. That they might shew the greater contempt of the
court, they ordered, by way of derision, that the impeachment should be carried
up by secretary Jenkins; who was so provoked by the intended affront, that he at
first refused obedience; though afterwards, being threatened with commitment, he
was induced to comply. The lords voted to remit the affair to the ordinary
courts of justice, before whom, as the attorney-general informed them, it was
already determined to try Fitz-harris. The commons maintained, that the peers
were obliged to receive every impeachment from the commons; and this indeed
seems to have been the first instance of their refusal: They therefore voted,
that the lords, in rejecting their impeachment, had |denied justice, and had
violated the constitution of parliament. They also declared, that whatever
inferior court should proceed against Fitz-harris, or any one that lay under
impeachment, would be guilty of a high breach of privilege. Great heats were
likely to ensue; and as the king saw no appearance of any better temper in the
commons, he gladly laid hold of the opportunity, #Parliament dissolved.#
afforded by a quarrel between the two houses; and he proceeded to a dissolution
of the parliament. The secret was so well kept, that the commons had no
intimation of it, till the black rod came to their door, and summoned them to
attend the king at the house of peers.

{#52} ^This^ vigorous measure, though it might have been foreseen, excited such
astonishment in the country party, as deprived them of all spirit, and reduced
them to absolute despair. They were sensible, though too late, that the king had
finally taken his resolution, and was determined to endure any extremity rather
than submit to those terms, which they had resolved to impose upon him. They
found, that he had patiently waited till affairs should come to full maturity;
and having now engaged a national party on his side, had boldly set his enemies
at defiance. No parliament, they knew, would be summoned for some years; and
during that long interval, the court, though perhaps at the head of an inferior
party, yet being possessed of all authority, would have every advantage over a
body, dispersed and disunited. These reflections crowded upon every one; and all
the exclusionists were terrified, lest Charles should follow the blow by some
action more violent, and immediately take vengeance on them for their long and
obstinate opposition to his measures. The king on his part was no less
apprehensive, lest despair might prompt them to have recourse to force, and make
some sudden attempt upon his person. Both parties therefore hurried from Oxford;
and in an instant, that city, so crowded and busy, was left in its usual
emptiness and tranquillity.

{#53} ^The^ court party gathered force from the dispersion and astonishment of
their antagonists, and adhered more firmly to the king, whose resolutions, they
now saw, could be entirely depended on. #Victory of the royalists.# The
violences of the exclusionists were every where exclaimed against and
aggravated; and even the reality of the plot, that great engine of their
authority, was openly called in question. The clergy |especially were busy in
this great revolution; and being moved, partly by their own fears, partly by the
insinuations of the court, they represented all their antagonists as sectaries
and republicans, and rejoiced in escaping those perils, which they believed to
have been hanging over them. Principles the most opposite to civil liberty, were
every where inforced from the pulpit, and adopted in numerous addresses; where
the king was flattered in his present measures, and congratulated on his escape
from parliaments. Could words have been depended on, the nation appeared to be
running fast into voluntary servitude, and seemed even ambitious of resigning
into the king's hands all the privileges, transmitted to them, through so many
ages, by their gallant ancestors.

{#54} ^But^ Charles had sagacity enough to distinguish between men's real
internal sentiments, and the language, which zeal and opposition to a contrary
faction may sometimes extort from them. Notwithstanding all these professions of
duty and obedience, he was resolved not to trust, for a long time, the people
with a new election, but to depend entirely on his own economy for alleviating
those necessities, under which he laboured. Great retrenchments were made in the
houshold: Even his favourite navy was neglected: Tangiers, though it had cost
great sums of money, was a few years after abandoned and demolished. The mole
was entirely destroyed; and the garrison, being brought over to England, served
to augment that small army, which the king relied on, as the solid basis of his
authority. It had been happy for the nation, had Charles used his victory with
justice and moderation equal to the prudence and dexterity, with which he
obtained it.

{#55} ^The^ first step, taken by the court, was the trial of Fitz-harris. Doubts
were raised by the jury with regard to their power of trying him, after the
concluding vote of the commons: But the judges took upon them to decide the
question in the affirmative; and the jury were obliged to proceed. The writing
of the libel was clearly proved upon Fitz-harris: The only question was with
regard to his intentions. He asserted, that he was a spy of the court, and had
accordingly carried the libel to the duchess of Portsmouth; and he was desirous,
that the jury should, in this transaction, consider him as a cheat, not as a
traitor. He failed however somewhat in the proof; and was brought in guilty of
treason by the jury.

{#56} ^Finding^ himself entirely in the hands of the king, he now retracted |all
his former impostures with regard to the popish plot, and even endeavoured to
atone for them by new impostures against the country party. He affirmed, that
these fictions had been extorted from him by the suggestions and artifices of
Treby the recorder, and of Bethel and Cornish, the two sheriffs: This account he
persisted in even at his execution; and though men knew, that nothing could be
depended on, which came from one so corrupt, and so lost to all sense of honour;
yet were they inclined, from his perseverance, to rely somewhat more on his
veracity in these last asseverations. But it appears, that his wife had some
connexions with Mrs. Wall, the favourite maid of the duchess of Portsmouth; and
Fitz-harris hoped, if he persisted in a story agreeable to the court, that some
favour might, on that account, be shown to his family.

{#57} ^It^ is amusing to reflect on the several lights, in which this story has
been represented by the opposite factions. The country party affirmed, that
Fitz-harris had been employed by the court, in order to throw the odium of the
libel on the exclusionists, and thereby give rise to a protestant plot: The
court party maintained, that the exclusionists had found out Fitz-harris, a spy
of the ministers, and had set him upon this undertaking, from an intention of
loading the court with the imputation of such a design upon the exclusionists.
Rather than acquit their antagonists, both sides were willing to adopt an
account the most intricate and incredible. It was a strange situation, in which
the people, at this time, were placed; to be every day tortured with these
perplexed stories, and inflamed with such dark suspicions against their
fellow-citizens. This was no less than the fifteenth false plot, or sham plot,
as they were then called, with which the court, it was imagined, had endeavoured
to load their adversaries[n5].

{#58} ^The^ country party had intended to make use of Fitz-harris's evidence
against the duke and the catholics; and his execution was therefore a great
mortification to them. But the king and his ministers were resolved not to be
contented with so slender an advantage. They were determined to pursue the
victory, and to employ against the exclusionists those very offensive arms,
however unfair, which that party had laid up in store against their antagonists.
|The whole gang of spies, witnesses, informers, suborners, who had so long been
supported and encouraged by the leading patriots, finding now that the king was
entirely master, turned short upon their old patrons, and offered their service
to the ministers. To the disgrace of the court and of the age, they were
received with hearty welcome; and their testimony or rather perjury made use of,
in order to commit legal murder upon the opposite party. With an air of triumph
and derision it was asked, "Are not these men good witnesses, who have
established the popish plot, upon whose testimony Stafford and so many catholics
have been executed, and whom you yourselves have so long celebrated as men of
credit and veracity? You have admitted them into your bosom: They are best
acquainted with your treasons: They are determined in another shape to serve
their king and country: And you cannot complain, that the same measure, which
you meted to others, should now, by a righteous doom or vengeance, be measured
out to you."

{#59} ^It^ is certain, that the principle of retaliation may serve in some cases
as a full apology, in others as an alleviation, for a conduct which would
otherwise be exposed to great blame. But these infamous arts, which poison
justice in its very source, and break all the bands of human society, are so
detestable and dangerous, that no pretence of retaliation can be pleaded as an
apology or even an alleviation of the crime incurred by them. On the contrary,
the greater indignation the king and his ministers felt, when formerly exposed
to the perjuries of abandoned men, the more reluctance should they now have
discovered against employing the same instruments of vengeance upon their
antagonists.

{#60} ^The^ first person, on whom the ministers fell, was one College, a London
joiner, who had become extremely noted for his zeal against popery, and was much
connected with Shaftesbury and the leaders of the country party: For as they
relied much upon the populace, men of College's rank and station were useful to
them. College had been in Oxford armed with sword and pistol during the sitting
of the parliament; and this was made the foundation of his crime. It was
pretended that a conspiracy had been entered into to seize the king's person,
and detain him in confinement, till he should make the concessions demanded of
him. The sheriffs of London were in strong opposition to the court; and it was
not strange, that the grand jury named by them rejected the bill |against
College. The prisoner was therefore sent to Oxford, where the treason was said
to have been committed. Lord Norris, a courtier, was sheriff of the county; and
the inhabitants were in general devoted to the court party. A jury was named,
consisting entirely of royalists; and though they were men of credit and
character, yet such was the factious rage, which prevailed, that little justice
could be expected by the prisoner. Some papers, containing hints and directions
for his defence, were taken from him, as he was conducted to his trial: An
iniquity, which some pretended to justify by alledging, that a like violence had
been practised against a prisoner during the fury of the popish plot. Such wild
notions of retaliation were at that time propagated by the court party.

{#61} ^The^ witnesses produced against College were Dugdale, Turberville,
Haynes, Smith; men who had before given evidence against the catholics, and whom
the jury, for that very reason, regarded as the most perjured villains. College,
though beset with so many toils, and oppressed with so many iniquities, defended
himself with spirit, courage, capacity, presence of mind; and he invalidated the
evidence of the crown, by convincing arguments and undoubted testimony: Yet did
the jury, after half an hour's deliberation, bring in a verdict against him. The
inhuman spectators received the verdict with a shout of applause: But the
prisoner was no wise dismayed. At his execution, he maintained the same manly
fortitude, and still denied the crime imputed to him. His whole conduct and
demeanour prove him to have been a man led astray only by the fury of the times,
and to have been governed by an honest, but indiscreet zeal for his country and
his religion.

{#62} ^Thus^ the two parties, actuated by mutual rage, but cooped up within the
narrow limits of the law, levelled with poisoned daggers the most deadly blows
against each other's breast, and buried in their factious divisions all regard
to truth, honour, and humanity.
