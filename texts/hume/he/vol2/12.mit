{#1} #1216.# MOST sciences, in proportion as they encrease and improve, invent
methods by which they facilitate their reasonings; and employing general
theorems, are enabled to comprehend in a few propositions a great number of
inferences and conclusions. History also, being a collection of facts which are
multiplying without |end, is obliged to adopt such arts of abridgment, to retain
the more material events, and to drop all the minute circumstances, which are
only interesting during the time, or to the persons engaged in the transactions.
This truth is no where more evident than with regard to the reign, upon which we
are going to enter. What mortal could have the patience to write or read a long
detail of such frivolous events as those with which it is filled, or attend to a
tedious narrative which would follow, through a series of fifty-six years, the
caprices and weaknesses of so mean a prince as Henry? The chief reason, why
protestant writers have been so anxious to spread out the incidents of this
reign, is in order to expose the rapacity, ambition, and artifices of the court
of Rome, and to prove, that the great dignitaries of the catholic church, while
they pretended to have nothing in view but the salvation of souls, had bent all
their attention to the acquisition of riches, and were restrained by no sense of
justice or of honour, in the pursuit of that great object[n1]. But this
conclusion would readily be allowed them, though it were not illustrated by such
a detail of uninteresting incidents; and follows indeed, by an evident
necessity, from the very situation, in which that church was placed with regard
to the rest of Europe. For, besides that ecclesiastical power, as it can always
cover its operations under a cloak of sanctity, and attacks men on the side
where they dare not employ their reason, lies less under controul than civil
government; besides this general cause, I say, the pope and his courtiers were
foreigners to most of the churches which they governed; they could not possibly
have any other object than to pillage the provinces for present gain; and as
they lived at a distance, they would be little awed by shame or remorse, in
employing every lucrative expedient, which was suggested to them. England being
one of the most remote provinces attached to the Romish hierarchy, as well as
the most prone to superstition, felt severely, during this reign, while its
patience was not yet fully exhausted, the influence of these causes; and we
shall often have occasion to touch cursorily upon such incidents. But we shall
not attempt to comprehend every transaction transmitted to us; and till the end
of the reign, when the events become more |memorable, we shall not always
observe an exact chronological order in our narration.

{#2} #Settlement of the government.# ^The^ earl of Pembroke, who, at the time of
John's death, was mareschal of England, was by his office at the head of the
armies, and consequently, during a state of civil wars and convulsions, at the
head of the government; and it happened fortunately for the young monarch and
for the nation, that the power could not have been intrusted into more able and
more faithful hands. This nobleman, who had maintained his loyalty unshaken to
John during the lowest fortune of that monarch, determined to support the
authority of the infant prince; nor was he dismayed at the number and violence
of his enemies. Sensible, that Henry, agreeably to the prejudices of the times,
would not be deemed a sovereign, till crowned and anointed by a churchman; he
immediately carried #28th Oct.# the young prince to Gloucester, where the
ceremony of coronation was performed, in the presence of Gualo, the legate, and
of a few noblemen, by the bishops of Winchester and Bath[n2]. As the concurrence
of the papal authority was requisite to support the tottering throne, Henry was
obliged to swear fealty to the pope, and renew that homage, to which his father
had already subjected the kingdom[n3]: And in order to enlarge the authority of
Pembroke, and to give him a more regular and legal title to it, a general
council of the barons was soon after summoned at Bristol, where that nobleman
#11th Nov.# was chosen protector of the realm.

{#3} ^Pembroke^, that he might reconcile all men to the government of his pupil,
made him grant a new charter of liberties, which, though mostly copied from the
former concessions extorted from John, contains some alterations, which may be
deemed remarkable[n4]. The full privilege of elections in the clergy, granted by
the late king, was not confirmed, nor the liberty of going out of the kingdom,
without the royal consent: Whence we may conclude, that Pembroke and the barons,
jealous of the ecclesiastical power, both were desirous of renewing the king's
claim to issue a congè d'elire to the monks and chapters, and thought it
requisite to put some check to the frequent appeals to Rome. But what may
chiefly |surprize us is, that the obligation, to which John had subjected
himself, of obtaining the consent of the great council before he levied any aids
or scutages upon the nation, was omitted; and this article was even declared
hard and severe, and was expressly left to future deliberation. But we must
consider, that, though this limitation may perhaps appear to us the most
momentous in the whole charter of John, it was not regarded in that light by the
ancient barons, who were more jealous in guarding against particular acts of
violence in the crown, than against such general impositions, which, unless they
were evidently reasonable and necessary, could scarcely, without general
consent, be levied upon men, who had arms in their hands, and who could repel
any act of oppression, by which they were all immediately affected. We
accordingly find, that Henry, in the course of his reign, while he gave frequent
occasions for complaint, with regard to his violations of the Great Charter,
never attempted, by his mere will, to levy any aids or scutages; though he was
often reduced to great necessities, and was refused supply by his people. So
much easier was it for him to transgress the law, when individuals alone were
affected, than even to exert his acknowledged prerogatives, where the interest
of the whole body was concerned.

{#4} ^This^ charter was again confirmed by the king in the ensuing year, with
the addition of some articles to prevent the oppressions by sheriffs: And also
with an additional charter of forests, a circumstance of great moment in those
ages, when hunting was so much the occupation of the nobility, and when the king
comprehended so considerable a part of the kingdom within his forests, which he
governed by peculiar and arbitrary laws. All the forests, which had been
enclosed since the reign of Henry II. were desaforested; and new perambulations
were appointed for that purpose: Offences in the forests were declared to be no
longer capital; but punishable by fine, imprisonment, and more gentle penalties:
And all the proprietors of land recovered the power of cutting and using their
own wood at their pleasure.

{#5} ^Thus^, these famous charters were brought nearly to the shape, in which
they have ever since stood; and they were, during many generations, the peculiar
favourites of the English nation, and esteemed the most sacred rampart to
national liberty and independance. As they secured the rights of all orders of
men, they were |anxiously defended by all, and became the basis, in a manner, of
the English monarchy, and a kind of original contract, which both limited the
authority of the king, and ensured the conditional allegiance of his subjects.
Though often violated, they were still claimed by the nobility and people; and
as no precedents were supposed valid, that infringed them, they rather acquired,
than lost authority, from the frequent attempts, made against them in several
ages, by regal and arbitrary power.

{#6} ^While^ Pembroke, by renewing and confirming the Great Charter, gave so
much satisfaction and security to the nation in general, he also applied himself
successfully to individuals: He wrote letters, in the king's name, to all the
malcontent barons; in which he represented to them, that, whatever jealousy and
animosity they might have entertained against the late king, a young prince, the
lineal heir of their ancient monarchs, had now succeeded to the throne, without
succeeding either to the resentments or principles of his predecessor: That the
desperate expedient, which they had employed, of calling in a foreign potentate,
had, happily for them as well as for the nation, failed of entire success, and
it was still in their power, by a speedy return to their duty, to restore the
independance of the kingdom, and to secure that liberty, for which they so
zealously contended: That as all past offences of the barons were now buried in
oblivion, they ought, on their part, to forget their complaints against their
late sovereign, who, if he had been any wise blameable in his conduct, had left
to his son the salutary warning, to avoid the paths, which had led to such fatal
extremities: And that having now obtained a charter for their liberties, it was
their interest to shew, by their conduct, that this acquisition was not
incompatible with their allegiance, and that the rights of king and people, so
far from being hostile and opposite, might mutually support and sustain each
other[n5].

{#7} ^These^ considerations, enforced by the character of honour and constancy,
which Pembroke had ever maintained, had a mighty influence on the barons; and
most of them began secretly to negotiate with him, and many of them openly
returned to their duty. The diffidence, which Lewis discovered, of their
fidelity, forwarded this general propension towards the king; and when the
|French prince refused the government of the castle of Hertford to Robert
Fitz-Walter, who had been so active against the late king, and who claimed that
fortress as his property, they plainly saw, that the English were excluded from
every trust, and that foreigners had engrossed all the confidence and affection
of their new sovereign[n6]. The excommunication too, denounced by the legate,
against all the adherents of Lewis, failed not, in the turn which men's
dispositions had taken, to produce a mighty effect upon them; and they were
easily persuaded to consider a cause as impious, for which they had already
entertained an unsurmountable aversion[n7]. Though Lewis made a journey to
France, and brought over succours from that kingdom[n8], he found, on his
return, that his party was still more weakened by the desertion of his English
confederates, and that the death of John had, contrary to his expectations,
given an incurable wound to his cause. The earls of Salisbury, Arundel, and
Warrenne, together with William Mareschal, eldest son of the protector, had
embraced Henry's party; and every English nobleman was plainly watching for an
opportunity of returning to his allegiance. Pembroke was so much strengthened by
these accessions, that he ventured to invest Mount-sorel; though, upon the
approach of the count of Perche with the French army, he desisted from his
enterprize, and raised the siege[n9]. The count, elated with this success,
marched to Lincoln; and being admitted into the town, he began to attack the
castle, which he soon reduced to extremity. The protector summoned all his
forces from every quarter in order to relieve a place of such importance; and he
appeared so much superior to the French, that they shut themselves up within the
city, and resolved to act upon the defensive[n10]. But the garrison of the
castle, having received a strong reinforcement, made a vigorous sally upon the
besiegers; while the English army, by concert, assaulted them in the same
instant from without, mounted the walls by scalade, and bearing down all
resistance, entered the city sword in hand. Lincoln was delivered over to be
pillaged; the French army was totally routed; the count de Perche, with only two
persons more, was killed, but many of the chief commanders and about 400 knights
were made |prisoners by the English[n11]. So little blood was shed in this
important action, which decided the fate of one of the most powerful kingdoms in
Europe; and such wretched soldiers were those ancient barons, who yet were
unacquainted with every thing but arms!

{#8} ^Prince^ Lewis was informed of this fatal event, while employed in the
siege of Dover, which was still valiantly defended against him by Hubert de
Burgh. He immediately retreated to London, the center and life of his party; and
he there received intelligence of a new disaster, which put an end to all his
hopes. A French fleet, bringing over a strong reinforcement, had appeared on the
coast of Kent; where they were attacked by the English under the command of
Philip d'Albiney, and were routed with considerable loss. D'Albiney employed a
stratagem against them, which is said to have contributed to the victory: Having
gained the wind of the French, he came down upon them with violence; and
throwing in their faces a great quantity of quicklime, which he purposely
carried on board, he so blinded them, that they were disabled from defending
themselves[n12].

{#9} ^After^ this second misfortune of the French, the English barons hastened
every where to make peace with the protector, and by an early submission, to
prevent those attainders, to which they were exposed on account of their
rebellion. Lewis, whose cause was now totally desperate, began to be anxious for
the safety of his person, and was glad, on any honourable conditions, to make
his escape from a country, where, he found, every thing was now become hostile
to him. He concluded a peace with Pembroke, promised to evacuate the kingdom,
and only stipulated in return, an indemnity to his adherents, and a restitution
of their honours and fortunes, together with the free and equal enjoyment of
those liberties, which had been granted to the rest of the nation[n13]. #General
pacification.# Thus was happily ended a civil war, which seemed to be founded on
the most incurable hatred and jealousy, and had threatened the kingdom with the
most fatal consequences.

{#10} ^The^ precautions, which the king of France used in the conduct of this
whole affair, are remarkable. He pretended, that his son |had accepted of the
offer from the English barons, without his advice, and contrary to his
inclination: The armies sent to England were levied in Lewis's name: When that
prince came over to France for aid, his father publicly refused to grant him any
assistance, and would not so much as admit him to his presence: Even after
Henry's party acquired the ascendant, and Lewis was in danger of falling into
the hands of his enemies, it was Blanche of Castile his wife, not the king his
father, who raised armies and equipped fleets for his succour[n14]. All these
artifices were employed, not to satisfy the pope; for he had too much
penetration to be so easily imposed on: Nor yet to deceive the people; for they
were too gross even for that purpose: They only served for a colouring to
Philip's cause; and in public affairs, men are often better pleased, that the
truth, though known to every body, should be wrapped up under a decent cover,
than if it were exposed in open day-light to the eyes of all the world.

{#11} ^After^ the expulsion of the French, the prudence and equity of the
protector's subsequent conduct, contributed to cure entirely those wounds, which
had been made by intestine discord. He received the rebellious barons into
favour; observed strictly the terms of peace, which he had granted them;
restored them to their possessions; and endeavoured, by an equal behaviour, to
bury all past animosities in perpetual oblivion. The clergy alone, who had
adhered to Lewis, were sufferers in this revolution. As they had rebelled
against their spiritual sovereign, by disregarding the interdict and
excommunication, it was not in Pembroke's power to make any stipulations in
their favour; and Gualo, the legate, prepared to take vengeance on them for
their disobedience[n15]. Many of them were deposed; many suspended; some
banished; and all who escaped punishment, made atonement for their offence, by
paying large sums to the legate, who amassed an immense treasure by this
expedient.

{#12} #Death of the protector.# ^The^ earl of Pembroke did not long survive the
pacification, which had been chiefly owing to his wisdom and valour[n16]; and he
was succeeded in the government by Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester, and
Hubert de Burgh, the justiciary. The councils of |the latter were chiefly
followed; and had he possessed equal authority in the kingdom with Pembroke, he
seemed to be every way worthy of filling the place of that virtuous nobleman.
#Some commotions.# But the licentious and powerful barons, who had once broken
the reins of subjection to their prince, and had obtained by violence an
enlargement of their liberties and independance, could ill be restrained by laws
under a minority; and the people, no less than the king, suffered from their
outrages and disorders. They retained by force the royal castles, which they had
seized during the past convulsions, or which had been committed to their custody
by the protector[n17]: They usurped the king's demesnes[n18]: They oppressed
their vassals: They infested their weaker neighbours: They invited all
disorderly people to enter in their retinue, and to live upon their lands: And
they gave them protection in all their robberies and extortions.

{#13} ^No^ one was more infamous for these violent and illegal practices than
the earl of Albemarle; who, though he had early returned to his duty, and had
been serviceable in expelling the French, augmented to the utmost the general
disorder, and committed outrages in all the counties of the North. In order to
reduce him to obedience, Hubert seized an opportunity of getting possession of
Rockingham castle, which Albemarle had garrisoned with his licentious retinue:
But this nobleman, instead of submitting, entered into a secret confederacy with
Fawkes de Breauté, Peter de Mauleon, and other barons, and both fortified the
castle of Biham for his defence, and made himself master by surprize of that of
Fotheringay. Pandulf, who was restored to his legateship, was active in
suppressing this rebellion; and with the concurrence of eleven bishops, he
pronounced the sentence of excommunication against Albemarle and his
adherents[n19]: An army was levied: A scutage of ten shillings a knight's fee
was imposed on all the military tenants: Albemarle's associates gradually
deserted him: And he himself was obliged at last to sue for mercy. He received a
pardon, and was restored to his whole estate.

{#14} ^This^ impolitic lenity, too frequent in those times, was probably the
result of a secret combination among the barons, who never could endure to see
the total ruin of one of their own order: But |it encouraged Fawkes de Breauté,
a man whom king John had raised from a low origin, to persevere in the course of
violence, to which he had owed his fortune, and to set at naught all law and
justice. When thirty-five verdicts were at one time found against him, on
account of his violent expulsion of so many freeholders from their possessions;
he came to the court of justice with an armed force, seized the judge who had
pronounced the verdicts, and imprisoned him in Bedford castle. He then levied
open war against the king; but being subdued, and taken prisoner, his life was
granted him: but his estate was confiscated, and he was banished the
kingdom[n20].

{#15} #1222.# ^Justice^ was executed with greater severity against disorders
less premeditated, which broke out in London. A frivolous emulation in a match
of wrestling, between the Londoners on the one hand, and the inhabitants of
Westminster and those of the neighbouring villages on the other, occasioned this
commotion. The former rose in a body, and pulled down some houses belonging to
the abbot of Westminster: But this riot, which, considering the tumultuous
disposition familiar to that capital, would have been little regarded, seemed to
become more serious, by the symptoms which then appeared, of the former
attachment of the citizens to the French interest. The populace, in the tumult,
made use of the cry of war commonly employed by the French troops; _Mountjoy,
mountjoy, God help us and our lord Lewis._ The justiciary made enquiry into the
disorder; and finding one Constantine Fitz Arnulf to have been the ringleader,
an insolent man, who justified his crime in Hubert's presence, he proceeded
against him by martial law, and ordered him immediately to be hanged, without
trial or form of process. He also cut off the feet of some of Constantine's
accomplices[n21].

{#16} ^This^ act of power was complained of as an infringement of the Great
Charter: Yet the justiciary, in a parliament, summoned at Oxford, (for the great
councils about this time began to receive that appellation) made no scruple to
grant in the king's name a renewal and confirmation of that charter. When the
assembly made application to the crown for this favour; as a law in those |times
seemed to lose its validity, if not frequently renewed; William de Briewere, one
of the council of regency, was so bold as to say openly, that those liberties
were extorted by force, and ought not to be observed: But he was reprimanded by
the archbishop of Canterbury, and was not countenanced by the king or his chief
ministers[n22]. A new confirmation was demanded and granted two years after; and
an aid, amounting to a fifteenth of all moveables, was given by the parliament,
in return for this indulgence. The king issued writs anew to the sheriffs,
enjoining the observance of the charter; but he inserted a remarkable clause in
the writs, that those, who payed not the fifteenth, should not for the future be
entitled to the benefit of those liberties[n23]:

{#17} ^The^ low state, into which the crown was fallen, made it requisite for a
good minister to be attentive to the preservation of the royal prerogatives, as
well as to the security of public liberty. Hubert applied to the pope, who had
always great authority in the kingdom, and was now considered as its superior
lord; and desired him to issue a bull, declaring the king to be of full age, and
entitled to exercise in person all the acts of royalty[n24]. In consequence of
this declaration, the justiciary resigned into Henry's hands the two important
fortresses of the Tower and Dover castle, which had been entrusted to his
custody; and he required the other barons to imitate his example. They refused
compliance: The earls of Chester and Albemarle, John Constable of Chester, John
de Lacy, Brian de l'Isle, and William de Cantel, with some others, even formed a
conspiracy to surprize London, and met in arms at Waltham with that intention:
But finding the king prepared for defence, they desisted from their enterprize.
When summoned to court, in order to answer for their conduct, they scrupled not
to appear, and to confess the design: But they told the king, that they had no
bad intentions against his person, but only against Hubert de Burgh, whom they
were determined to remove from his office[n25]. They appeared too formidable to
be chastised; and they were so little discouraged by the failure of their first
enterprize, that they again met in arms at Leicester, in order to seize the
king, who then resided at Northampton: But Henry, informed of their purpose,
|took care to be so well armed and attended, that the barons found it dangerous
to make the attempt; and they sat down and kept Christmas in his
neighbourhood[n26]. The archbishop and the prelates, finding every thing tend
towards a civil war, interposed with their authority, and threatened the barons
with the sentence of excommunication, if they persisted in detaining the king's
castles. This menace at last prevailed: Most of the fortresses were surrendered;
though the barons complained, that Hubert's castles were soon after restored to
him, while the king still kept theirs in his own custody. There are said to have
been 1115 castles at that time in England[n27].

{#18} ^It^ must be acknowledged, that the influence of the prelates and the
clergy was often of great service to the public. Though the religion of that age
can merit no better name than that of superstition, it served to unite together
a body of men who had great sway over the people, and who kept the community
from falling to pieces, by the factions and independant power of the nobles. And
what was of great importance; it threw a mighty authority into the hands of men,
who by their profession were averse to arms and violence; who tempered by their
mediation the general disposition towards military enterprizes; and who still
maintained, even amidst the shock of arms, those secret links, without which it
is impossible for human society to subsist.

{#19} ^Notwithstanding^ these intestine commotions in England, and the
precarious authority of the crown, Henry was obliged to carry on war in France;
and he employed to that purpose the fifteenth which had been granted him by
parliament. Lewis VIII. who had succeeded to his father Philip, instead of
complying with Henry's claim, who demanded the restitution of Normandy and the
other provinces wrested from England, made an irruption into Poictou, took
Rochelle[n28] after a long siege, and seemed determined to expel the English
from the few provinces which still remained to them. Henry sent over his uncle,
the earl of Salisbury; together with his brother prince Richard, to whom he had
granted the earldom of Cornwal, which had escheated to the crown. Salisbury
stopped the progress of Lewis's arms, and retained the Poictevin and Gascon
|vassals in their allegiance: But no military action of any moment was performed
on either side. The earl of Cornwal, after two years' stay in Guienne, returned
to England.

{#20} #1227.# ^This^ prince was nowise turbulent or factious in his disposition:
His ruling passion was to amass money, in which he succeeded so well as to
become the richest subject in Christendom: Yet his attention to gain threw him
sometimes into acts of violence, and gave disturbance to the government. There
was a manor, which had formerly belonged to the earldom of Cornwal, but had been
granted to Waleran de Ties, before Richard had been invested with that dignity,
and while the earldom remained in the crown. Richard claimed this manor, and
expelled the proprietor by force: Waleran complained: The king ordered his
brother to do justice to the man, and restore him to his rights: The earl said,
that he would not submit to these orders, till the cause should be decided
against him by the judgment of his peers: Henry replied, that it was first
necessary to re-instate Waleran in possession, before the cause could be tried;
and he re-iterated his orders to the earl[n29]. We may judge of the state of the
government, when this affair had nearly produced a civil war. The earl of
Cornwal, finding Henry peremptory in his commands, associated himself with the
young earl of Pembroke, who had married his sister, and who was displeased on
account of the king's requiring him to deliver up some royal castles which were
in his custody. These two malcontents took into the confederacy the earls of
Chester, Warenne, Glocester, Hereford, Warwic, and Ferrers, who were all
disgusted on a like account[n30]. They assembled an army, which the king had not
the power or courage to resist; and he was obliged to give his brother
satisfaction, by grants of much greater importance than the manor, which had
been the first ground of the quarrel[n31].

{#21} ^The^ character of the king, as he grew to man's estate, became every day
better known; and he was found in every respect unqualified for maintaining a
proper sway among those turbulent barons, whom the feudal constitution subjected
to his authority. Gentle, humane, and merciful even to a fault, he seems to have
been steady in no other circumstance of his character; but to have received
every impression from those who surrounded him, and whom he |loved, for the
time, with the most imprudent and most unreserved affection. Without activity or
vigour, he was unfit to conduct war; without policy or art, he was ill-fitted to
maintain peace; His resentments, though hasty and violent, were not dreaded,
while he was found to drop them with such facility; his friendships were little
valued, because they were neither derived from choice, nor maintained with
constancy. A proper pageant of state in a regular monarchy, where his ministers
could have conducted all affairs in his name and by his authority; but too
feeble in those disorderly times to sway a scepter, whose weight depended
entirely on the firmness and dexterity of the hand which held it.

{#22} #Hubert de Burgh displaced.# ^The^ ablest and most virtuous minister that
Henry ever possessed, was Hubert de Burgh[n32]; a man who had been steady to the
crown in the most difficult and dangerous times, and who yet shewed no
disposition, in the height of his power, to enslave or oppress the people. The
only exceptionable part of his conduct is that which is mentioned by Matthew
Paris[n33], if the fact be really true, and proceeded from Hubert's advice,
namely, the recalling publicly and the annulling of the charter of forests, a
concession so reasonable in itself, and so passionately claimed both by the
nobility and people: But it must be confessed, that this measure is so unlikely,
both from the circumstances of the times and character of the minister, that
there is reason to doubt of its reality, especially as it is mentioned by no
other historian. Hubert, while he enjoyed his authority, had an entire ascendant
over Henry, and was loaded with honours and favours beyond any other subject.
#1231.# Besides acquiring the property of many castles and manors, he married
the eldest sister of the king of Scots, was created earl of Kent, and by an
unusual concession, was made chief justiciary of England for life: Yet Henry, in
a sudden caprice, threw off this faithful minister, and exposed him to the
violent persecutions of his enemies. Among other frivolous crimes objected to
him, he was accused of gaining the king's affections by enchantment, and of
purloining from the royal treasury a gem, which had the virtue to render the
wearer invulnerable, and of sending this valuable curiosity to the prince of
Wales[n34]. The nobility, who hated Hubert on account of his |zeal in resuming
the rights and possessions of the crown, no sooner saw the opportunity
favourable, than they inflamed the king's animosity against him, and pushed him
to seek the total ruin of his minister. Hubert took sanctuary in a church: The
king ordered him to be dragged from thence: He recalled those orders: He
afterwards renewed them: He was obliged by the clergy to restore him to the
sanctuary: He constrained him soon after to surrender himself prisoner, and he
confined him in the castle of the Devises. Hubert made his escape, was expelled
the kingdom, was again received into favour, recovered a great share of the
king's confidence, but never showed any inclination to reinstate himself in
power and authority[n35].

{#23} #Bishop of Winchester minister.# ^The^ man, who succeeded him in the
government of the king and kingdom, was Peter, bishop of Winchester, a Poictevin
by birth, who had been raised by the late king, and who was no less
distinguished by his arbitrary principles and violent conduct, than by his
courage and abilities. This prelate had been left by king John justiciary and
regent of the kingdom during an expedition which that prince made into France;
and his illegal administration was one chief cause of that great combination
among the barons, which finally extorted from the crown the charter of
liberties, and laid the foundations of the English constitution. Henry, though
incapable, from his character, of pursuing the same violent maxims, which had
governed his father, had imbibed the same arbitrary principles; and in
prosecution of Peter's advice, he invited over a great number of Poictevins and
other foreigners, who, he believed, could more safely be trusted than the
English, and who seemed useful to counterbalance the great and independant power
of the nobility[n36]. Every office and command was bestowed on these strangers;
they exhausted the revenues of the crown, already too much impoverished[n37];
they invaded the rights of the people; and their insolence, still more provoking
than their power, drew on them the hatred and envy of all orders of men in the
kingdom[n38].

{#24} #1233.# ^The^ barons formed a combination against this odious ministry,
and withdrew from parliament; on pretence of the danger, to which they were
exposed from the machinations of the Poictevins. |When again summoned to attend,
they gave for answer, that the king should dismiss his foreigners: Otherwise
they would drive both him and them out of the kingdom, and put the crown on
another head, more worthy to wear it[n39]: Such was the style they used to their
sovereign! They at last came to parliament, but so well attended, that they
seemed in a condition to prescribe laws to the king and ministry. Peter des
Roches, however, had in the interval found means of sowing dissention among
them, and of bringing over to his party the earl of Cornwal, as well as the
earls of Lincoln and Chester. The confederates were disconcerted in their
measures: Richard, earl Mareschal, who had succeeded to that dignity on the
death of his brother, William, was chased into Wales; he thence withdrew into
Ireland; where he was treacherously murdered by the contrivance of the bishop of
Winchester[n40]. The estates of the more obnoxious barons were confiscated,
without legal sentence or trial by their peers[n41]; and were bestowed with a
profuse liberality on the Poictevins. Peter even carried his insolence so far as
to declare publickly, that the barons of England must not pretend to put
themselves on the same foot with those of France, or assume the same liberties
and privileges: The monarch in the former country had a more absolute power than
in the latter. It had been more justifiable for him to have said, that men, so
unwilling to submit to the authority of laws, could with the worse grace claim
any shelter or protection from them.

{#25} ^When^ the king at any time was checked in his illegal practices, and when
the authority of the Great Charter was objected to him, he was wont to reply;
"Why should I observe this charter, which is neglected by all my grandees, both
prelates and nobility?" It was very reasonably said to him: "You ought, sir, to
set them the example."[n42]

{#26} ^So^ violent a ministry, as that of the bishop of Winchester, could not be
of long duration; but its fall proceeded at last from the influence of the
church, not from the efforts of the nobles. Edmond, the primate, came to court,
attended by many of the other prelates; and represented to the king the
pernicious measures embraced by Peter des Roches, the discontents of his people,
the |ruin of his affairs; and after requiring the dismission of the minister and
his associates, threatened him with excommunication, in case of his refusal.
Henry, who knew that an excommunication, so agreeable to the sense of the
people, could not fail of producing the most dangerous effects, was obliged to
submit: Foreigners were banished: The natives were restored to their place in
council[n43]: The primate, who was a man of prudence, and who took care to
execute the laws and observe the charter of liberties, bore the chief sway in
the government.

{#27} #1236. 14th January.# ^But^ the English in vain flattered themselves that
they should be long free from the dominion of foreigners. #King's partiality to
foreigners.# The king, having married Eleanor, daughter of the count of
Provence[n44], was surrounded by a great number of strangers from that country,
whom he caressed with the fondest affection, and enriched by an imprudent
generosity[n45]. The bishop of Valence, a prelate of the house of Savoy, and
maternal uncle to the queen, was his chief minister, and employed every art to
amass wealth for himself and his relations. Peter of Savoy, a brother of the
same family, was invested in the honour of Richmond, and received the rich
wardship of earl Warrenne: Boniface of Savoy was promoted to the see of
Canterbury: Many young ladies were invited over from Provence, and married to
the chief noblemen in England, who were the king's wards[n46]: And as the source
of Henry's bounty began to fail, his Savoyard ministry applied to Rome, and
obtained a bull; permitting him to resume all past grants; absolving him from
the oath, which he had taken to maintain them; even enjoining him to make such a
resumption, and representing those grants as invalid, on account of the
prejudice which ensued from them to the Roman pontiff, in whom the superiority
of the kingdom was vested[n47]. The opposition, made to the intended resumption,
prevented it from taking place; but the nation saw the indignities, to which the
king was willing to submit, in order to gratify the avidity of his foreign
favourites. About the same time, he published in England the sentence of
excommunication pronounced against the emperor Frederic, his
brother-in-law[n48]; and said in excuse, that, being the pope's vassal, he was
obliged by his allegiance to obey all the commands |of his holiness. In this
weak reign, when any neighbouring potentate insulted the king's dominions,
instead of taking revenge for the injury, he complained to the pope as his
superior lord, and begged him to give protection to his vassal[n49].

{#28} #Grievances.# ^The^ resentment of the English barons rose high at the
preference given to foreigners; but no remonstrance or complaint could ever
prevail on the king to abandon them, or even to moderate his attachment towards
them. After the Provençals and Savoyards might have been supposed pretty well
satiated with the dignities and riches which they had acquired, a new set of
hungry foreigners were invited over, and shared among them those favours, which
the king ought in policy to have conferred on the English nobility, by whom his
government could have been supported and defended. His mother, Isabella, who had
been unjustly taken by the late king from the count de la Marche, to whom she
was betrothed, was no sooner mistress of herself by the death of her husband,
than #1247.# she married that nobleman[n50]; and she had born him four sons,
Guy, William, Geoffrey, and Aymer, whom she sent over to England, in order to
pay a visit to their brother. The good-natured and affectionate disposition of
Henry was moved at the sight of such near relations; and he considered neither
his own circumstances, nor the inclinations of his people, in the honours and
riches which he conferred upon them[n51]. Complaints rose as high against the
credit of the Gascon as ever they had done against that of the Poictevin and of
the Savoyard favourites; and to a nation prejudiced against them, all their
measures appeared exceptionable and criminal. Violations of the Great Charter
were frequently mentioned; and it is indeed more than probable, that foreigners,
ignorant of the laws, and relying on the boundless affections of a weak prince,
would, in an age, when a regular administration was not any where known, pay
more attention to their present interest than to the liberties of the people. It
is reported, that the Poictevins and other strangers, when the laws were at any
time appealed to, in opposition to their oppressions, scrupled not to reply,
_What did the English laws signify to them? They minded them not._ And as words
are often more offensive than actions, this open contempt of the English |tended
much to aggravate the general discontent, and made every act of violence,
committed by the foreigners, appear not only an injury, but an affront to
them[n52].

{#29} ^I^ reckon not among the violations of the Great Charter, some arbitrary
exertions of prerogative, to which Henry's necessities pushed him, and which,
without producing any discontent, were uniformly continued by all his
successors, till the last century. As the parliament often refused him supplies,
and that in a manner somewhat rude and indecent[n53], he obliged his opulent
subjects, particularly the citizens of London, to grant him loans of money; and
it is natural to imagine, that the same want of economy, which reduced him to
the necessity of borrowing, would prevent him from being very punctual in the
repayment[n54]. He demanded benevolences or pretended voluntary contributions
from his nobility and prelates[n55]. He was the first king of England since the
conquest, that could fairly be said to lie under the restraint of law; and he
was also the first that practised the dispensing power, and employed the clause
of _Non-obstante_ in his grants and patents. When objections were made to this
novelty, he replied, that the pope exercised that authority; and why might not
he imitate the example? But the abuse, which the pope made of his dispensing
power, in violating the canons of general councils, in invading the privileges
and customs of all particular churches, and in usurping on the rights of
patrons, was more likely to excite the jealousy of the people, than to reconcile
them to a similar practice in their civil government. Roger de Thurkesby, one of
the king's justices, was so displeased with the precedent, that he exclaimed,
_Alas! what times are we fallen into? Behold, the civil court is corrupted in
imitation of the ecclesiastical, and the river is poisoned from that fountain._

{#30} ^The^ king's partiality and profuse bounty to his foreign relations, and
to their friends and favourites, would have appeared more tolerable to the
English, had any thing been done meanwhile for the honour of the nation, or had
Henry's enterprizes in foreign countries, been attended with any success or
glory to himself or to the public: At least, such military talents in the king
would have served to keep his barons in awe, and have given weight and
|authority to his government. But though he declared war against Lewis IX. in
1242, and made an expedition into Guienne, upon the invitation of his
father-in-law, the count de la Marche, who promised to join him with all his
forces; he was unsuccessful in his attempts against that great monarch, was
worsted at Taillebourg, was deserted by his allies, lost what remained to him of
Poictou, and was obliged to return, with loss of honour, into England[n56].
#1253.# The Gascon nobility were attached to the English government; because the
distance of their sovereign allowed them to remain in a state of almost total
independance: And they claimed, some time after, Henry's protection against an
invasion, which the king of Castile made upon that territory. Henry returned
into Guienne, and was more successful in this expedition; but he thereby
involved himself and his nobility in an enormous debt, which both encreased
their discontents, and exposed him to greater danger from their
enterprizes[n57].

{#31} ^Want^ of economy and an ill-judged liberality were Henry's great defects;
and his debts, even before this expedition, had become so troublesome, that he
sold all his plate and jewels, in order to discharge them. When this expedient
was first proposed to him, he asked, where he should find purchasers? It was
replied, the citizens of London. _On my word,_ said he, _if the_ _treasury of
Augustus were brought to sale, the citizens are able to be the purchasers: These
clowns, who assume to themselves the name of barons, abound in every thing,
while we are reduced to necessities[n58]._ And he was thence forth observed to
be more forward and greedy in his exactions upon the citizens[n59].

{#32} #Ecclesiastical grievances.# ^But^ the grievances, which the English
during this reign had reason to complain of in the civil government, seem to
have been still less burthensome than those which they suffered from the
usurpations and exactions of the court of Rome. On the death of Langton in 1228,
the monks of Christ-church elected Walter de Hemesham, one of their own body,
for his successor: But as Henry refused to confirm the election, the pope, at
his desire, annulled it[n60]; and immediately appointed Richard, chancellor of
Lincoln, for archbishop, without waiting for a new election. On the death of
Richard in 1231, the monks elected Ralph de Neville bishop of |Chichester; and
though Henry was much pleased with the election, the pope, who thought that
prelate too much attached to the crown, assumed the power of annulling his
election[n61]. He rejected two clergymen more, whom the monks had successively
chosen; and he at last told them, that, if they would elect Edmond, treasurer of
the church of Salisbury, he would confirm their choice; and his nomination was
complied with. The pope had the prudence to appoint both times very worthy
primates; but men could not forbear observing his intention of thus drawing
gradually to himself the right of bestowing that important dignity.

{#33} ^The^ avarice, however, more than the ambition of the see of Rome, seems
to have been in this age the ground of general complaint. The papal ministers,
finding a vast stock of power amassed by their predecessors, were desirous of
turning it to immediate profit, which they enjoyed at home, rather than of
enlarging their authority in distant countries, where they never intended to
reside. Every thing was become venal in the Romish tribunals; simony was openly
practised; no favours and even no justice could be obtained without a bribe; the
highest bidder was sure to have the preference, without regard either to the
merits of the person or of the cause; and besides the usual perversions of right
in the decision of controversies, the pope openly assumed an absolute and
uncontroled authority of setting aside, by the plenitude of his apostolic power,
all particular rules and all privileges of patrons, churches, and convents. On
pretence of remedying these abuses, pope Honorius, in 1226, complaining of the
poverty of his see as the source of all grievances, demanded from every
cathedral two of the best prebends, and from every convent two monks' portions,
to be set apart as a perpetual and settled revenue of the papal crown: But all
men being sensible, that the revenue would continue for ever, the abuses
immediately return, his demand was unanimously rejected. About three years
after, the pope demanded and obtained the tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues,
which he levied in a very oppressive manner; requiring payment before the clergy
had drawn their rents or tythes, and sending about usurers, who advanced them
the money at exorbitant interest. In the year 1240, Otho, the legate, having in
vain attempted the clergy in a body, |obtained separately, by intrigues and
menaces, large sums from the prelates and convents, and on his departure is said
to have carried more money out of the kingdom than he left in it. This
experiment was renewed four years after with success by Martin the nuncio, who
brought from Rome powers of suspending and excommunicating all clergymen, that
refused to comply with his demands. The king, who relied on the pope for the
support of his tottering authority, never failed to countenance those exactions.

{#34} ^Meanwhile^, all the chief benefices of the kingdom were conferred on
Italians; great numbers of that nation were sent over at one time to be provided
for; non-residence and pluralities were carried to an enormous height; Mansel,
the king's chaplain, is computed to have held at once seven hundred
ecclesiastical livings; and the abuses became so evident as to be palpable to
the blindness of superstition itself. The people, entering into associations,
rose against the Italian clergy; pillaged their barns; wasted their lands;
insulted the persons of such of them as they found in the kingdom[n62]; and when
the justices made enquiry into the authors of this disorder, the guilt was found
to involve so many, and those of such high rank, that it passed unpunished. At
last, when Innocent IV. in 1245, called a general council at Lyons, in order to
excommunicate the emperor Frederic, the king and nobility sent over agents to
complain before the council, of the rapacity of the Romish church. They
represented, among many other grievances, that the benefices of the Italian
clergy in England had been estimated, and were found to amount to 60,000
marks[n63] a year, a sum which exceeded the annual revenue of the crown
itself[n64]. They obtained only an evasive answer from the pope; but as mention
had been made before the council, of the feudal subjection of England to the see
of Rome, the English agents, at whose head was Roger Bigod earl of Norfolk,
exclaimed against the pretension, and insisted, that king John had no right,
without the consent of |his barons, to subject the kingdom to so ignominious a
servitude[n65]. The popes indeed, afraid of carrying matters too far against
England, seem thenceforth to have little insisted on that pretension.

{#35} ^This^ check, received at the council of Lyons, was not able to stop the
court of Rome in its rapacity: Innocent exacted the revenues of all vacant
benefices, the twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues without exception; the
third of such as exceeded a hundred marks a year; the half of such as were
possessed by non-residents[n66]. He claimed the goods of all intestate
clergymen[n67]; he pretended a title to inherit all money gotten by usury; he
levied benevolences upon the people; and when the king, contrary to his usual
practice, prohibited these exactions, he threatened to pronounce against him the
same censures, which he had emitted against the emperor Frederic[n68].

{#36} #1255.# ^But^ the most oppressive expedient, employed by the pope, was the
embarking of Henry in a project for the conquest of Naples, or Sicily on this
side the Fare, as it was called; an enterprize, which threw much dishonour on
the king, and involved him, during some years, in great trouble and expence. The
Romish church, taking advantage of favourable incidents, had reduced the kingdom
of Sicily to the same state of feudal vassalage, which she pretended to extend
over England, and which, by reason of the distance, as well as high spirit of
this latter kingdom, she was not able to maintain. After the death of the
emperor, Frederic II. the succession of Sicily devolved to Conradine, grandson
of that monarch; and Mainfroy, his natural son, under pretence of governing the
kingdom during the minority of the prince, had formed a scheme of establishing
his own authority. Pope Innocent, who had carried on violent war against the
emperor, Frederic, and had endeavoured to dispossess him of his Italian
dominions, still continued hostilities against his grandson; but being
disappointed in all his schemes by the activity and artifices of Mainfroy, he
found, that his own force alone was not sufficient to bring to a happy issue so
great an enterprize. He pretended to dispose of the Sicilian crown, both as
superior lord of that particular kingdom, and as |vicar of Christ, to whom all
kingdoms of the earth were subjected; and he made a tender of it to Richard earl
of Cornwal, whose immense riches, he flattered himself, would be able to support
the military operations against Mainfroy. As Richard had the prudence to refuse
the present[n69], he applied to the king, whose levity and thoughtless
disposition gave Innocent more hopes of success; and he offered him the crown of
Sicily for his second son, Edmond[n70]. Henry, allured by so magnificent a
present, without reflecting on the consequences, without consulting either with
his brother or the parliament, accepted of the insidious proposal; and gave the
pope unlimited credit to expend whatever sums he thought necessary for
compleating the conquest of Sicily. Innocent, who was engaged by his own
interests to wage war with Mainfroy, was glad to carry on his enterprizes at the
expence of his ally: Alexander IV. who succeeded him in the papal throne,
continued the same policy: And Henry was surprized to find himself on a sudden
involved in an immense debt, which he had never been consulted in contracting.
The sum already amounted to 135,541 marks beside interest[n71]; and he had the
prospect, if he answered this demand, of being soon loaded with more exorbitant
expences; if he refused it, of both incurring the pope's displeasure, and losing
the crown of Sicily, which he hoped soon to have the glory of fixing on the head
of his son.

{#37} ^He^ applied to the parliament for supply; and that he might be sure not
to meet with opposition, he sent no writs to the more refractory barons: But
even those who were summoned, sensible of the ridiculous cheat, imposed by the
pope, determined not to lavish their money on such chimerical projects; and
making a pretext of the absence of their brethren, they refused to take the
king's demands into consideration[n72]. In this extremity the clergy were his
only resource; and as both their temporal and spiritual sovereign concurred in
loading them, they were ill able to defend themselves against this united
authority.

{#38} ^The^ pope published a crusade for the conquest of Sicily; and required
every one, who had taken the cross against the Infidels, or had vowed to advance
money for that service, to support the war |against Mainfroy, a more terrible
enemy, as he pretended, to the Christian faith than any Saracen[n73]. He levied
a tenth on all ecclesiastical benefices in England for three years; and gave
orders to excommunicate all bishops, who made not punctual payment. He granted
to the king the goods of intestate clergymen; the revenues of vacant benefices;
the revenues of all non-residents[n74]. But these taxations, being levied by
some rule, were deemed less grievous, than another imposition, which arose from
the suggestion of the bishop of Hereford, and which might have opened the door
to endless and intolerable abuses.

{#39} ^This^ prelate, who resided at the court of Rome by a deputation from the
English church, drew bills of different values, but amounting on the whole to
150,540 marks, on all the bishops and abbots of the kingdom; and granted these
bills to Italian merchants, who, it was pretended, had advanced money for the
service of the war against Mainfroy[n75]. As there was no likelihood of the
English prelates' submitting, without compulsion, to such an extraordinary
demand, Rustand, the legate, was charged with the commission of employing
authority to that purpose; and he summoned an assembly of the bishops and
abbots, whom he acquainted with the pleasure of the pope and of the king. Great
were the surprize and indignation of the assembly: The bishop of Worcester
exclaimed, that he would lose his life rather than comply: The bishop of London
said, that the pope and king were more powerful than he; but if his mitre were
taken off his head, he would clap on a helmet in its place[n76]. The legate was
no less violent on the other hand; and he told the assembly, in plain terms,
that all ecclesiastical benefices were the property of the pope, and he might
dispose of them, either in whole or in part, as he saw proper[n77]. In the end,
the bishops and abbots, being threatened with excommunication, which made all
their revenues fall into the king's hands, were obliged to submit to the
exaction: And the only mitigation, which the legate allowed them, was, that the
tenths, already granted, should be accepted as a partial payment of the bills.
But the money was still insufficient for the pope's purpose: The conquest of
Sicily was as remote as ever: The demands which |came from Rome were endless:
Pope Alexander became so urgent a creditor, that he sent over a legate to
England; threatening the kingdom with an interdict, and the king with
excommunication, if the arrears, which he pretended to be due to him, were not
instantly remitted[n78]: And at last, Henry, sensible of the cheat, began to
think of breaking off the agreement, and of resigning into the pope's hands that
crown, which, it was not intended by Alexander, that he or his family should
ever enjoy[n79].

{#40} #Earl of Cornwal elected king of the Romans.# ^The^ earl of Cornwal had
now reason to value himself on his foresight, in refusing the fraudulent bargain
with Rome, and in preferring the solid honours of an opulent and powerful prince
of the blood of England, to the empty and precarious glory of a foreign dignity.
But he had not always firmness sufficient to adhere to this resolution: His
vanity and ambition prevailed at last over his prudence and his avarice; and he
was engaged in an enterprize no less expensive and vexatious than that of his
brother, and not attended with much greater probability of success. The immense
opulence of Richard having made the German princes cast their eye on him as a
candidate for the empire; he was tempted to expend vast sums of money on his
election, and he succeeded so far as to be chosen king of the Romans, which
seemed to render his succession infallible to the imperial throne. He went over
to Germany, and carried out of the kingdom no less a sum than seven hundred
thousand marks, if we may credit the account given by some ancient authors[n80],
which is probably much exaggerated[n81]. His money, while it lasted, procured
him friends and partizans: But it was soon drained from him by the avidity of
the German princes; |and, having no personal or family connexions in that
country, and no solid foundation of power, he found at last, that he had
lavished away the frugality of a whole life, in order to procure a splendid
title, and that his absence from England, joined to the weakness of his
brother's government, gave reins to the factious and turbulent dispositions of
the English barons, and involved his own country and family in great calamities.

{#41} #Discontents of the barons.# The successful revolt of the nobility from
king John, and their imposing on him and his successors limitations of their
royal power, had made them feel their own weight and importance, had set a
dangerous precedent of resistance, and being followed by a long minority, had
impoverished, as well as weakened that crown, which they were at last induced,
from the fear of worse consequences, to re-place on the head of young Henry. In
the king's situation, either great abilities and vigour were requisite to
over-awe the barons, or great caution and reserve to give them no pretence for
complaints; and it must be confessed, that this prince was possessed of neither
of these talents. He had not prudence to chuse right measures, he wanted even
that constancy, which sometimes gives weight to wrong ones; he was entirely
devoted to his favourites, who were always foreigners; he lavished on them
without discretion his diminished revenue; and finding, that his barons indulged
their disposition towards tyranny, and observed not to their own vassals the
same rules, which they had imposed on the crown, he was apt, in his
administration, to neglect all the salutary articles of the Great Charter; which
he remarked to be so little regarded by his nobility. This conduct had extremely
lessened his authority in the kingdom; had multiplied complaints against him;
and had frequently exposed him to affronts, and even to dangerous attempts upon
his prerogative. In the year 1244, when he desired a supply from parliament, the
barons, complaining of the frequent breaches of the Great Charter, and of the
many fruitless applications which they had formerly made for the redress of this
and other grievances, demanded in return, that he should give them the
nomination of the great justiciary and of the chancellor, to whose hands chiefly
the administration of justice was committed: And, if we may credit the
historian[n82], they had formed the plan |of other limitations, as well as of
associations to maintain them, which would have reduced the king to be an
absolute cypher, and have held the crown in perpetual pupillage and dependance.
The king, to satisfy them, would agree to nothing but a renewal of the charter,
and a general permission to excommunicate all the violaters of it: And he
received no supply, except a scutage of twenty shillings on each knight's fee
for the marriage of his eldest daughter to the king of Scotland; a burthen,
which was expressly annexed to their feudal tenures.

{#42} ^Four^ years after, in a full parliament, when Henry demanded a new
supply, he was openly reproached with the breach of his word, and the frequent
violations of the charter. He was asked, whether he did not blush to desire any
aid from his people, whom he professedly hated and despised, to whom on all
occasions he preferred aliens and foreigners, and who groaned under the
oppressions, which he either permitted or exercised over them. He was told,
that, besides disparaging his nobility by forcing them to contract unequal and
mean marriages with strangers, no rank of men was so low as to escape vexations
from him or his ministers; that even the victuals consumed in his household, the
clothes which himself and his servants wore, still more the wine which they
used, were all taken by violence from the lawful owners, and no compensation was
ever made them for the injury; that foreign merchants, to the great prejudice
and infamy of the kingdom, shunned the English harbours, as if they were
possessed by pirates, and the commerce with all nations was thus cut off by
these acts of violence; that loss was added to loss, and injury to injury, while
the merchants, who had been despoiled of their goods, were also obliged to carry
them at their own charge to whatever place the king was pleased to appoint them;
that even the poor fishermen on the coast could not escape his oppressions and
those of his courtiers; and finding that they had not full liberty to dispose of
their commodities in the English market, were frequently constrained to carry
them to foreign ports, and to hazard all the perils of the ocean, rather than
those which awaited them from his oppressive emissaries; and that his very
religion was a ground of complaint to his subjects, while they observed, that
the waxen tapers and splendid silks, employed in so many useful processions,
were the spoils |which he had forcibly ravished from the true owners[n83].
Throughout this remonstrance, in which the complaints, derived from an abuse of
the ancient right of purveyance, may be supposed to be somewhat exaggerated,
there appears a strange mixture of regal tyranny in the practices which gave
rise to it, and of aristocratical liberty or rather licentiousness in the
expressions employed by the parliament. But a mixture of this kind is observable
in all the ancient feudal governments; and both of them proved equally hurtful
to the people.

{#43} ^As^ the king, in answer to their remonstrance, gave the parliament only
good words and fair promises, attended with the most humble submissions, which
they had often found deceitful, he obtained at that time no supply; and
therefore, in the year 1253, when he found himself again under the necessity of
applying to parliament, he had provided a new pretence, which he deemed
infallible, and taking the vow of a Crusade, he demanded their assistance in
that pious enterprize[n84]. The parliament, however, for some time hesitated to
comply; and the ecclesiastical order sent a deputation consisting of four
prelates, the primate, and the bishops of Winchester, Salisbury, and Carlisle,
in order to remonstrate with him on his frequent violations of their privileges,
the oppressions with which he had loaded them and all his subjects[n85], and the
uncanonical and forced elections, which were made to vacant dignities. "It is
true," replied the king, "I have been somewhat faulty in this particular: I
obtruded you my lord of Canterbury, upon your see: I was obliged to employ both
entreaties and menaces, my lord of Winchester, to have you elected: My
proceedings, I confess, were very irregular, my lords of Salisbury and Carlisle,
when I raised you from the lowest stations to your present dignities: I am
determined henceforth to correct these abuses; and it will also become you, in
order to make a thorough reformation, to resign your present benefices; and try
to enter again in a more regular and canonical manner."[n86] The bishops,
surprized at these unexpected sarcasms, replied, that the question was not at
present how to correct past errors, but to avoid them for the future. The |king
promised redress both of ecclesiastical and civil grievances; and the parliament
in return agreed to grant him a supply, a tenth of the ecclesiastical benefices,
and a scutage of three marks on each knight's fee: But as they had experienced
his frequent breach of promise, they required, that he should ratify the Great
Charter in a manner still more authentic and more solemn than any which he had
hitherto employed. All the prelates and abbots were assembled: They held burning
tapers in their hands: The Great Charter was read before them: They denounced
the sentence of excommunication against every one who should thence forth
violate that fundamental law: They threw their tapers on the ground, and
exclaimed, _May the soul of every one, who incurs this sentence, so stink and
corrupt in Hell!_ The king bore a part in this ceremony; and subjoined: "So help
me God, I will keep all these articles inviolate, as I am a man, as I am a
christian, as I am a knight, and as I am a king crowned and anointed."[n87] Yet
was the tremendous ceremony no sooner finished, than his favourites, abusing his
weakness, made him return to the same arbitrary and irregular administration;
and the reasonable expectations of his people were thus perpetually eluded and
disappointed[n88].

{#44} #1258. Simon de Mountfort earl of Leicester.# ^All^ these imprudent and
illegal measures afforded a pretence to Simon de Mountfort, earl of Leicester,
to attempt an innovation in the government, and to wrest the scepter from the
feeble and irresolute hand which held it. This nobleman was a younger son of
that Simon de Mountfort, who had conducted with such valour and renown the
Crusade against the Albigenses, and who, though he tarnished his famous exploits
by cruelty and ambition, had left a name very precious to all the bigots of that
age, particularly to the ecclesiastics. A large inheritance in England fell by
succession to this family; but as the elder brother enjoyed still more opulent
possessions in France, and could not perform fealty to two masters, he
transferred his right to Simon, his younger brother, who came over to England,
did homage for his lands, and was raised to the dignity of earl of Leicester. In
the year 1238, he espoused Eleanor dowager of William earl of Pembroke, and
sister to the king[n89]; but the marriage of this princess with a subject and a
foreigner, though |contracted with Henry's consent, was loudly complained of by
the earl of Cornwal, and all the barons of England; and Leicester was supported
against their violence, by the king's favour and authority alone[n90]. But he
had no sooner established himself in his possessions and dignities, than he
acquired, by insinuation and address, a strong interest with the nation, and
gained equally the affections of all orders of men. He lost, however, the
friendship of Henry from the usual levity and fickleness of that prince; he was
banished the court; he was recalled; he was entrusted with the command of
Guienne[n91], where he did good service and acquired honour; he was again
disgraced by the king, and his banishment from court seemed now final and
irrevocable. Henry called him traitor to his face; Leicester gave him the lye,
and told him, that, if he were not his sovereign, he would soon make him repent
of that insult. Yet was this quarrel accommodated either from the good-nature or
timidity of the king; and Leicester was again admitted into some degree of
favour and authority. But as this nobleman was become too great to preserve an
entire complaisance to Henry's humours, and to act in subserviency to his other
minions; he found more advantage in cultivating his interest with the public,
and in inflaming the general discontents, which prevailed against the
administration. He filled every place with complaints against the infringement
of the Great Charter, the acts of violence committed on the people, the
combination between the pope and the king in their tyranny and extortions,
Henry's neglect of his native subjects and barons; and though himself a
foreigner, he was more loud than any in representing the indignity of submitting
to the dominion of foreigners. By his hypocritical pretensions to devotion, he
gained the favour of the zealots and clergy: By his seeming concern for public
good, he acquired the affections of the public: And besides the private
friendships, which he had cultivated with the barons, his animosity against the
favourites created an union of interests between him and that powerful order.

{#45} ^A^ recent quarrel, which broke out between Leicester and William de
Valence, Henry's half brother, and chief favourite, brought matters to
extremity[n92], and determined the former to give full scope to his bold and
unbounded ambition, which the laws and |the king's authority had hitherto with
difficulty restrained. He secretly called a meeting of the most considerable
barons, particularly Humphrey de Bohun, high constable, Roger Bigod, earl
mareschal, and the earls of Warwic and Glocester; men, who by their family and
possessions stood in the first rank of the English nobility. He represented to
this company the necessity of reforming the state, and of putting the execution
of the laws into other hands than those which had hitherto appeared, from
repeated experience, so unfit for the charge with which they were entrusted. He
exaggerated the oppressions exercised against the lower orders of the state, the
violations of the barons' privileges, the continued depredations made on the
clergy; and in order to aggravate the enormity of this conduct, he appealed to
the Great Charter, which Henry had so often ratified, and which was calculated
to prevent for ever the return of those intolerable grievances. He magnified the
generosity of their ancestors, who, at a great expence of blood, had extorted
that famous concession from the crown; but lamented their own degeneracy, who
allowed so important an advantage, once obtained, to be wrested from them by a
weak prince and by insolent strangers. And he insisted, that the king's word,
after so many submissions and fruitless promises on his part, could no longer be
relied on; and that nothing but his absolute inability to violate national
privileges could henceforth ensure the regular observance of them.

{#46} ^These^ topics, which were founded in truth, and suited so well the
sentiments of the company, had the desired effect, and the barons embraced a
resolution of redressing the public grievances, by taking into their own hands
the administration of government. Henry having summoned a parliament, in
expectation of receiving supplies for his Sicilian project, the barons appeared
in the hall, clad in complete armour, and with their swords by their side: The
king on his entry, struck with the unusual appearance, asked them what was their
purpose, and whether they pretended to make him their prisoner[n93]? Roger Bigod
replied in the name of the rest, that he was not their prisoner, but their
sovereign; that they even intended to grant him large supplies, in order to fix
his son on the throne of Sicily; that they only expected some return for this
expence |and service; and that, as he had frequently made submissions to the
parliament, had acknowledged his past errors, and had still allowed himself to
be carried into the same path, which gave them such just reason of complaint, he
must now yield to more strict regulations, and confer authority on those who
were able and willing to redress the national grievances. Henry, partly allured
by the hopes of supply, partly intimidated by the union and martial appearance
of the barons, agreed to their demand; and promised to summon another parliament
at Oxford, in order to digest the new plan of government, and to elect the
persons, who were to be entrusted with the chief authority.

{#47} #11 June. Provisions of Oxford.# ^This^ parliament, which the royalists,
and even the nation, from experience of the confusions that attended its
measures, afterwards denominated the _mad parliament,_ met on the day appointed;
and as all the barons brought along with them their military vassals, and
appeared with an armed force, the king, who had taken no precautions against
them, was in reality a prisoner in their hands, and was obliged to submit to all
the terms which they were pleased to impose upon him. Twelve barons were
selected from among the king's ministers; twelve more were chosen by parliament:
To these twenty-four, unlimited authority was granted to reform the state; and
the king himself took an oath, that he would maintain whatever ordinances they
should think proper to enact for that purpose[n94]. Leicester was at the head of
this supreme council, to which the legislative power was thus in reality
transferred; and all their measures were taken by his secret influence and
direction. Their first step bore a specious appearance, and seemed well
calculated for the end, which they professed to be the object of all these
innovations: They ordered that four knights should be chosen by each county;
that they should make enquiry into the grievances of which their neighbourhood
had reason to complain, and should attend the ensuing parliament, in order to
give in formation to that assembly of the state of their particular
counties[n95]: A nearer approach to our present constitution than had been made
by the barons in the reign of king John, when the knights were only appointed to
meet in their several counties, and there to draw up |a detail of their
grievances. Meanwhile the twenty-four barons proceeded to enact some
regulations, as a redress of such grievances as were supposed to be sufficiently
notorious. They ordered, that three sessions of parliament should be regularly
held every year, in the months of February, June, and October; that a new
sheriff should be annually elected by the votes of the free holders in each
county[n96]; that the sheriffs should have no power of fining the barons who did
not attend their courts, or the circuits of the justiciaries; that no heirs
should be committed to the wardship of foreigners, and no castles intrusted to
their custody; and that no new warrens or forests should be created, nor the
revenues of any counties or hundreds be let to farm. Such were the regulations
which the twenty-four barons established at Oxford, for the redress of public
grievances.

{#48} ^But^ the earl of Leicester and his associates, having advanced so far to
satisfy the nation, instead of continuing in this popular course, or granting
the king that supply which they had promised him, immediately provided for the
extension and continuance of their own authority. They rouzed anew the popular
clamour, which had long prevailed against foreigners; and they fell with the
utmost violence on the king's half-brothers, who were supposed to be the authors
of all national grievances, and whom Henry had no longer any power to protect.
The four brothers, sensible of their danger, took to flight, with an intention
of making their escape out of the kingdom; they were eagerly pursued by the
barons; Aymer, one of the brothers, who had been elected to the see of
Winchester, took shelter in his episcopal palace, and carried the others along
with him; they were surrounded in that place, and threatened to be dragged out
by force, and to be punished for their crimes and misdemeanors; and the king,
pleading the sacredness of an ecclesiastical sanctuary, was glad to extricate
them from this danger by banishing them the kingdom. In this act of violence, as
well as in the former usurpations of the barons, the queen and her uncles were
thought to have secretly concurred; being jealous of the credit acquired by the
brothers, which, they found, had eclipsed and annihilated their own.

{#49} #Usurpations of the barons.# ^But^ the subsequent proceedings of the
twenty-four barons were sufficient to open the eyes of the nation, and to prove
their intention of reducing for ever both the king and the people under the
arbitrary power of a very narrow aristocracy, which must at last have terminated
either in anarchy, or in a violent usurpation and tyranny. They pretended, that
they had not yet digested all the regulations necessary for the reformation of
the state, and for the redress of grievances; and that they must still retain
their power, till that great purpose were thoroughly effected: In other words,
that they must be perpetual governors, and must continue to reform, till they
were pleased to abdicate their authority. They formed an association among
themselves, and swore that they would stand by each other with their lives and
fortunes: They displaced all the chief officers of the crown, the justiciary,
the chancellor, the treasurer; and advanced either themselves or their own
creatures in their place: Even the offices of the king's household were disposed
of at their pleasure: The government of all the castles was put into hands in
whom they found reason to confide: And the whole power of the state being thus
transferred to them, they ventured to impose an oath; by which all the subjects
were obliged to swear, under the penalty of being declared public enemies, that
they would obey and execute all the regulations, both known and unknown, of the
twenty-four barons: And all this, for the greater glory of God, the honour of
the church, the service of the king, and the advantage of the kingdom[n97]. No
one dared to withstand this tyrannical authority: Prince Edward himself, the
king's eldest son, a youth of eighteen, who began to give indications of that
great and manly spirit, which appeared throughout the whole course of his life,
was, after making some opposition, constrained to take that oath, which really
deposed his father and his family from sovereign authority[n98]. Earl Warrenne
was the last person in the kingdom, that could be brought to give the
confederated barons this mark of submission.

{#50} ^But^ the twenty-four barons, not content with the usurpation of the royal
power, introduced an innovation in the constitution of parliament, which was of
the utmost importance. They ordained, |that this assembly should chuse a
committee of twelve persons, who should, in the intervals of the sessions,
possess the authority of the whole parliament, and should attend on a summons
the person of the king, in all his motions. But so powerful were these barons,
that this regulation was also submitted to; the whole government was overthrown
or fixed on new foundations; and the monarchy was totally subverted, without its
being possible for the king to strike a single stroke in defence of the
constitution against the newly erected oligarchy.

{#51} #1259.# ^The^ report, that the king of the Romans intended to pay a visit
to England, gave alarm to the ruling barons, who dreaded lest the extensive
influence and established authority of that prince would be employed to restore
the prerogatives of his family, and overturn their plan of government[n99]. They
sent over the bishop of Worcester, who met him at St. Omars; asked him, in the
name of the barons, the reason of his journey, and how long he intended to stay
in England; and insisted, that, before he entered the kingdom, he should swear
to observe the regulations established at Oxford. On Richard's refusal to take
this oath, they prepared to resist him as a public enemy; they fitted out a
fleet, assembled an army, and exciting the inveterate prejudices of the people
against foreigners, from whom they had suffered so many oppressions, spread the
report that Richard, attended by a number of strangers, meant to restore by
force the authority of his exiled brothers, and to violate all the securities
provided for public liberty. The king of the Romans was at last obliged to
submit to the terms required of him[n100].

{#52} ^But^ the barons, in proportion to their continuance in power, began
gradually to lose that popularity, which had assisted them in obtaining it; and
men repined, that regulations, which were occasionally established, for the
reformation of the state, were likely to become perpetual, and to subvert
entirely the ancient constitution. They were apprehensive, lest the power of the
nobles, always oppressive, should now exert itself without controul, by removing
the counterpoise of the crown; and their fears were increased by some new edicts
of the barons, which were plainly calculated to procure to themselves an
impunity in all their violences. They appointed, that the circuits of the
itinerant justices, the sole check on their |arbitrary conduct, should be held
only once in seven years; and men easily saw, that a remedy, which returned
after such long intervals, against an oppressive power, which was perpetual,
would prove totally insignificant and useless[n101]. The cry became loud in the
nation, that the barons should finish their intended regulations. The knights of
the shires, who seem now to have been pretty regularly assembled, and sometimes
in a separate house, made remonstrances against the slowness of their
proceedings. They represented, that, though the king had performed all the
conditions required of him, the barons had hitherto done nothing for the public
good, and had only been careful to promote their own private advantage, and to
make inroads on royal authority; and they even appealed to prince Edward, and
claimed his interposition for the interests of the nation, and the reformation
of the government[n102]. The prince replied, that, though it was from
constraint, and contrary to his private sentiments, he had sworn to maintain the
provisions of Oxford, he was determined to observe his oath: But he sent a
message to the barons, requiring them to bring their undertaking to a speedy
conclusion, and fulfil their engagements to the public: Otherwise, he menaced
them, that, at the expence of his life, he would oblige them to do their duty,
and would shed the last drop of his blood in promoting the interests, and
satisfying the just wishes of the nation[n103].

{#53} ^The^ barons, urged by so pressing a necessity, published at last a new
code of ordinances for the reformation of the state[n104]: But the expectations
of the people were extremely disappointed, when they found, that these consisted
only of some trivial alterations in the municipal law; and still more, when the
barons pretended, that the task was not yet finished, and that they must farther
prolong their authority, in order to bring the work of reformation to the
desired period. The current of popularity was now much turned to the side of the
crown; and the barons had little to rely on for their support, besides the
private influence and power of their families, which, though exorbitant, was
likely to prove inferior to the combination of king and people. Even this basis
of power was daily weakened by their intestine jealousies and animosities; their
ancient |and inveterate quarrels broke out when they came to share the spoils of
the crown; and the rivalship between the earls of Leicester and Glocester, the
chief leaders among them, began to disjoint the whole confederacy. The latter,
more moderate in his pretensions, was desirous of stopping or retarding the
career of the barons' usurpations; but the former, enraged at the opposition
which he met with in his own party, pretended to throw up all concern in English
affairs; and he retired into France[n105].

{#54} ^The^ kingdom of France, the only state with which England had any
considerable intercourse, was at this time governed by Lewis IX. a prince of the
most singular character that is to be met with in all the records of history.
This monarch united, to the mean and abject superstition of a monk, all the
courage and magnanimity of the greatest hero; and, what may be deemed more
extraordinary, the justice and integrity of a disinterested patriot, the
mildness and humanity of an accomplished philosopher. So far from taking
advantage of the divisions among the English, or attempting to expel those
dangerous rivals from the provinces, which they still possessed in France; he
had entertained many scruples with regard to the sentence of attainder
pronounced against the king's father, had even expressed some intention of
restoring the other provinces, and was only prevented from taking that imprudent
resolution, by the united remonstrances of his own barons, who represented the
extreme danger of such a measure[n106], and, what had a greater influence on
Lewis, the justice of punishing by a legal sentence the barbarity and felony of
John. Whenever this prince interposed in English affairs, it was always with an
intention of composing the differences between the king and his nobility; he
recommended to both parties every peaceable and reconciling measure; and he used
all his authority with the earl of Leicester, his native subject, to bend him to
a compliance with Henry. #20th May.# He made a treaty with England, at a time
when the distractions of that kingdom were at the greatest height, and when the
king's authority was totally annihilated; and the terms, which he granted,
might, even in a more prosperous state of their affairs, be deemed reasonable
and advantageous to the English. He yielded up some territories which had been
conquered from Poictou and Guienne; he |ensured the peaceable possession of the
latter province to Henry; he agreed to pay that prince a large sum of money; and
he only required that the king should, in return, make a final cession of
Normandy, and the other provinces, which he could never entertain any hopes of
recovering by force of arms[n107]. This cession was ratified by Henry, by his
two sons, and two daughters, and by the king of the Romans and his three sons:
Leicester alone, either moved by a vain arrogance, or desirous to ingratiate
himself with the English populace, protested against the deed, and insisted on
the right, however distant, which might accrue to his consort[n108]. Lewis saw
in his obstinacy the unbounded ambition of the man; and as the barons insisted,
that the money, due by treaty, should be at their disposal, not at Henry's, he
also saw, and probably with regret, the low condition, to which this monarch,
who had more erred from weakness than from any bad intentions, was reduced by
the turbulence of his own subjects.

{#55} #1261.# ^But^ the situation of Henry soon after wore a more favourable
aspect. The twenty-four barons had now enjoyed the sovereign power near three
years; and had visibly employed it, not for the reformation of the state, which
was their first pretence, but for the aggrandizement of themselves and of their
families. The breach of trust was apparent to all the world: Every order of men
felt it, and murmured against it: The dissensions among the barons themselves,
which encreased the evil, made also the remedy more obvious and easy: And the
secret desertion in particular of the earl of Glocester to the crown, seemed to
promise Henry certain success in any attempt to resume his authority. Yet durst
he not take that step, so reconcilable both to justice and policy, without
making a previous application to Rome, and desiring an absolution from his oaths
and engagements[n109].

{#56} ^The^ pope was at this time much dissatisfied with the conduct of the
barons; who, in order to gain the favour of the people and clergy of England,
had expelled all the Italian ecclesiastics, had confiscated their benefices, and
seemed determined to maintain the liberties and privileges of the English
church, in which the rights of patronage, belonging to their own families, were
included. |The extreme animosity of the English clergy against the Italians was
also a source of his disgust to this order; and an attempt, which had been made
by them for farther liberty and greater independance on the civil power, was
therefore less acceptable to the court of Rome[n110]. About the same time, that
the barons at Oxford had annihilated the prerogatives of the monarchy, the
clergy met in a synod at Merton, and passed several ordinances, which were no
less calculated to promote their own grandeur at the expence of the crown. They
decreed, that it was unlawful to try ecclesiastics by secular judges; that the
clergy were not to regard any prohibitions from civil courts; that lay-patrons
had no right to confer spiritual benefices; that the magistrate was obliged,
without farther enquiry, to imprison all excommunicated persons; and that
ancient usage, without any particular grant or charter, was a sufficient
authority for any clerical possessions or privileges[n111]. About a century
before, these claims would have been supported by the court of Rome beyond the
most fundamental articles of faith: They were the chief points maintained by the
great martyr, Becket; and his resolution in defending them had exalted him to
the high station which he held in the catalogue of Romish saints. But principles
were changed with the times: The pope was become somewhat jealous of the great
independance of the English clergy, which made them stand less in need of his
protection, and even emboldened them to resist his authority, and to complain of
the preference given to the Italian courtiers, whose interests, it is natural to
imagine, were the chief object of his concern. He was ready therefore, on the
king's application, to annul these new constitutions of the church of
England[n112]. And, at the same time, he absolved the king and all his subjects
from the oath which they had taken to observe the provisions of Oxford[n113].

{#57} #Prince Edward.# ^Prince^ Edward, whose liberal mind, though in such early
youth, had taught him the great prejudice, which his father had incurred, by his
levity, inconstancy, and frequent breach of promise, refused for a long time to
take advantage of this absolution; and declared that the provisions of Oxford,
how unreasonable soever in themselves, and how much soever abused by the barons,
ought still to |be adhered to by those who had sworn to observe them[n114]: He
himself had been constrained by violence to take that oath; yet was he
determined to keep it. By this scrupulous fidelity, the prince acquired the
confidence of all parties, and was afterwards enabled to recover fully the royal
authority, and to perform such great actions both during his own reign and that
of his father.

{#58} ^The^ situation of England, during this period, as well as that of most
European kingdoms, was somewhat peculiar. There was no regular military force
maintained in the nation: The sword, however, was not, properly speaking, in the
hands of the people: The barons were alone entrusted with the defence of the
community; and after any effort, which they made, either against their own
prince, or against foreigners, as the military retainers departed home, the
armies were disbanded, and could not speedily be reassembled at pleasure. It was
easy therefore, for a few barons, by a combination, to get the start of the
other party, to collect suddenly their troops, and to appear unexpectedly in the
field with an army, which their antagonists, though equal or even superior in
power and interest, would not dare to encounter. Hence the sudden revolutions,
which often took place in those governments: Hence the frequent victories
obtained without a blow by one faction over the other: And hence it happened,
that the seeming prevalence of a party, was seldom a prognostic of its long
continuance in power and authority.

{#59} #1262.# ^The^ king, as soon as he received the pope's absolution from his
oath, accompanied with menaces of excommunication against all opponents,
trusting to the countenance of the church, to the support promised him by many
considerable barons, and to the returning favour of the people, immediately took
off the mask. After justifying his conduct by a proclamation, in which he set
forth the private ambition, and the breach of trust, conspicuous in Leicester
and his associates, he declared, that he had resumed the government, and was
determined thenceforth to exert the royal authority for the protection of his
subjects. He removed Hugh le Despenser and Nicholas de Ely, the justiciary and
chancellor appointed by the barons; and put Philip Basset and Walter de Merton
in their place. #23 April.# He substituted new sheriffs in all the counties, men
|of character and honour: He placed new governors in most of the castles: He
changed all the officers of his household: He summoned a parliament, in which
the resumption of his authority was ratified, with only five dissenting voices:
And the barons, after making one fruitless effort, to take the king by surprize
at Winchester, were obliged to acquiesce in those new regulations[n115].

{#60} ^The^ king, in order to cut off every objection to his conduct, offered to
refer all the differences between him and the earl of Leicester, to Margaret
queen of France[n116]. The celebrated integrity of Lewis gave a mighty influence
to any decision which issued from his court; and Henry probably hoped, that the
gallantry, on which all barons, as true knights, valued themselves, would make
them ashamed not to submit to the award of that princess. Lewis merited the
confidence reposed in him. By an admirable conduct, probably as political as
just, he continually interposed his good offices to allay the civil discords of
the English: He forwarded all healing measures, which might give security to
both parties: And he still endeavoured, though in vain, to sooth by persuasion
the fierce ambition of the earl of Leicester, and to convince him how much it
was his duty to submit peaceably to the authority of his sovereign.

{#61} #1263.# ^That^ bold and artful conspirator was nowise discouraged by the
bad success of his past enterprizes. The death of Richard earl of locester, who
was his chief rival in power, and who, before his decease, had joined the royal
party, seemed to open a new field to his violence, and to expose the throne to
fresh insults and injuries. It was in vain, that the king professed his
intentions of observing strictly the great charter, even of maintaining all the
regulations made by the reforming barons at Oxford or afterwards, except those
which entirely annihilated the royal authority: These powerful chieftains, now
obnoxious to the court, could not peaceably resign the hopes of entire
independance and uncontrouled power, with which they had flattered themselves,
and which they had so long enjoyed. #Civil wars of the barons.# Many of them
engaged in Leicester's views, and among the rest, Gilbert, the young earl of
Glocester, who brought him a mighty accession of power, from the extensive
authority possessed by that opulent family. Even Henry, son of the king of |the
Romans, commonly called Henry d'Allmaine, though a prince of the blood, joined
the party of the barons against the king, the head of his own family. Leicester
himself, who still resided in France, secretly formed the links of this great
conspiracy, and planned the whole scheme of operations.

{#62} ^The^ princes of Wales, notwithstanding the great power of the monarchs,
both of the Saxon and Norman line, still preserved authority in their own
country. Though they had often been constrained to pay tribute to the crown of
England, they were with difficulty retained in subordination or even in peace;
and almost through every reign since the conquest, they had infested the English
frontiers with such petty incursions and sudden inroads, as seldom merit to have
place in a general history. The English, still content with repelling their
invasions, and chacing them back into their mountains, had never pursued the
advantages obtained over them, nor been able, even under their greatest and most
active princes, to fix a total, or so much as a feudal subjection on the
country. This advantage was reserved to the present king, the weakest and most
indolent. In the year 1237, Lewellyn, prince of Wales, declining in years and
broken with infirmities, but still more harassed with the rebellion and
undutiful behaviour of his younger son, Griffin, had recourse to the protection
of Henry; and consenting to subject his principality, which had so long
maintained, or soon recovered, its independance, to vassalage under the crown of
England, had purchased security and tranquillity on these dishonourable terms.
His eldest son and heir, David, renewed the homage to England; and having taken
his brother prisoner, delivered him into Henry's hands, who committed him to
custody in the Tower. That prince, endeavouring to make his escape, lost his
life in the attempt; and the prince of Wales, freed from the apprehensions of so
dangerous a rival, paid thenceforth less regard to the English monarch, and even
renewed those incursions, by which the Welsh, during so many ages, had been
accustomed to infest the English borders. Lewellyn, however, the son of Griffin,
who succeeded to his uncle, had been obliged to renew the homage, which was now
claimed by England as an established right; but he was well pleased to inflame
those civil discords, on which he rested his present security, and founded his
hopes of future independance. He entered into a confederacy with the earl |of
Leicester, and collecting all the force of his principality, invaded England
with an army of 30,000 men. He ravaged the lands of Roger de Mortimer and of all
the barons, who adhered to the crown[n117]; he marched into Cheshire, and
committed like depredations on prince Edward's territories; every place, where
his disorderly troops appeared, was laid waste with fire and sword; and though
Mortimer, a gallant and expert soldier, made stout resistance, it was found
necessary, that the prince himself should head the army against this invader.
Edward repulsed prince Lewellyn, and obliged him to take shelter in the
mountains of North Wales: But he was prevented from making farther progress
against the enemy, by the disorders, which soon after broke out in England.

{#63} ^The^ Welsh invasion was the appointed signal for the malcontent barons to
rise in arms; and Leicester, coming over secretly from France, collected all the
forces of his party, and commenced an open rebellion. He seized the person of
the bishop of Hereford; a prelate obnoxious to all the inferior clergy, on
account of his devoted attachment to the court of Rome[n118]. Simon, bishop of
Norwich, and John Mansel, because they had published the pope's bull, absolving
the king and kingdom from their oaths to observe the provisions of Oxford, were
made prisoners, and exposed to the rage of the party. The king's demesnes were
ravaged with unbounded fury[n119]; and as it was Leicester's interest to allure
to his side, by the hopes of plunder, all the disorderly ruffians in England, he
gave them a general licence to pillage the barons of the opposite party, and
even all neutral persons. But one of the principal resources of his faction was
the populace of the cities, particularly of London; and as he had, by his
hypocritical pretensions to sanctity, and his zeal against Rome, engaged the
monks and lower ecclesiastics in his party, his dominion over the inferior ranks
of men became uncontroulable. Thomas Fitz-Richard, mayor of London, a furious
and licentious man, gave the countenance of authority to these disorders in the
capital; and having declared war against the substantial citizens, he loosened
all the bands of government, by which that turbulent city was commonly but ill
restrained. On the approach of Easter, the zeal of superstition, the appetite
for plunder, |or what is often as prevalent with the populace as either of these
motives, the pleasure of committing havoc and destruction, prompted them to
attack the unhappy Jews, who were first pillaged without resistance, then
massacred, to the number of five hundred persons[n120]. The Lombard bankers were
next exposed to the rage of the people; and though, by taking sanctuary in the
churches, they escaped with their lives, all their money and goods became a prey
to the licentious multitude. Even the houses of the rich citizens, though
English, were attacked by night; and way was made by sword and by fire to the
pillage of their goods, and often to the destruction of their persons. The
queen, who, though defended by the Tower, was terrified by the neighbourhood of
such dangerous commotions, resolved to go by water to the castle of Windsor; but
as she approached the bridge, the populace assembled against her: The cry ran,
_drown the witch;_ and besides abusing her with the most opprobrious language,
and pelting her with rotten eggs and dirt, they had prepared large stones to
sink her barge, when she should attempt to shoot the bridge; and she was so
frightened that she returned to the Tower[n121].

{#64} ^The^ violence and fury of Leicester's faction had risen to such a height
in all parts of England, that the king, unable to resist their power, was
obliged to set on foot a treaty of peace; and to make an #18th July.#
accommodation with the barons on the most disadvantageous terms[n122]. He agreed
to confirm anew the provisions of Oxford, even those which entirely annihilated
the royal authority; and the barons were again re-instated in the sovereignty of
the kingdom. They restored Hugh le Despenser to the office of chief justiciary;
they appointed their own creatures sheriffs in every county of England; they
took possession of all the royal castles and fortresses; they even named all the
officers of the king's household; and they summoned a parliament to meet at
Westminister in order to settle #14th Oct.# more fully their plan of government.
They here produced a new list of twenty-four barons, to whom they proposed, that
the administration should be entirely committed; and they insisted, that the
authority of this junto should continue, not only during the reign of the king,
but also during that of prince Edward.

{#65} ^This^ prince, the life and soul of the royal party, had unhappily,
|before the king's accommodation with the barons, been taken prisoner by
Leicester in a parley at Windsor[n123]; and that misfortune, more than any other
incident, had determined Henry to submit to the ignominious conditions imposed
upon him. But Edward, having recovered his liberty by the treaty, employed his
activity in defending the prerogatives of his family; and he gained a great part
even among those who had at first adhered to the cause of the barons. His
cousin, Henry d'Allmaine, Roger Bigod earl mareshal, earl Warrenne, Humphrey
Bohun earl of Hereford, John lord Basset, Ralph Basset, Hamond l'Estrange, Roger
Mortimer, Henry de Piercy, Robert de Brus, Roger de Leybourne, with almost all
the Lords Marchers, as they were called, on the borders of Wales and of
Scotland, the most warlike parts of the kingdom, declared in favour of the royal
cause; and hostilities, which were scarcely well composed, were again renewed in
every part of England. But the near balance of the parties, joined to the
universal clamour of the people, obliged the king and barons to open anew the
negotiations for peace; and it was agreed by both sides to submit their
differences to the arbitration of the king of France[n124].

{#66} #Reference to the king of France.# ^This^ virtuous prince, the only man,
who, in like circumstances, could safely have been intrusted with such an
authority by a neighbouring nation, had never ceased to interpose his good
offices between the English factions; and had even, during the short interval of
peace, invited over to Paris both the king and the earl of Leicester, in order
to accommodate the differences between them; but found, that the fears and
animosities on both sides, as well as the ambition of Leicester, were so
violent, as to render all his endeavours ineffectual. But when this solemn
appeal, ratified by the oaths and subscriptions of the leaders in both factions,
was made to his judgment, he was not discouraged from pursuing his honourable
purpose: He summoned the states of France at Amiens; #1264.# and there, in the
presence of that assembly, as well as in that of the king of England and Peter
de Montfort, Leicester's son, he brought this great cause to a trial and
examination. It appeared to him, that the provisions of Oxford, even had they
not been extorted by force, had they not been so exorbitant in their nature and
|subversive of the ancient constitution, were expressly established as a
temporary expedient, and could not, without breach of trust, be rendered
perpetual by the barons. #23rd Jan.# He therefore annulled these provisions;
restored to the king the possession of his castles, and the power of nomination
to the great offices; allowed him to retain what foreigners he pleased in his
kingdom, and even to confer on them places of trust and dignity; and in a word,
re-established the royal power in the same condition on which it stood before
the meeting of the parliament at Oxford. But while he thus suppressed dangerous
innovations, and preserved unimpaired the prerogatives of the English crown, he
was not negligent of the rights of the people; and besides ordering that a
general amnesty should be granted for all past offences, he declared, that his
award was not any wise meant to derogate from the privileges and liberties which
the nation enjoyed by any former concessions or charters of the crown[n125].

{#67} ^This^ equitable sentence was no sooner known in England, than Leicester
and his confederates determined to reject it, and to have recourse to arms, in
order to procure to themselves more safe and advantageous conditions[n126].
#Renewal of the civil wars.# Without regard to his oaths and subscriptions, that
enterprising conspirator directed his two sons, Richard and Peter de Montfort,
in conjunction with Robert de Ferrars, earl of Derby, to attack the city of
Worcester; while Henry and Simon de Montfort, two others of his sons, assisted
by the prince of Wales, were ordered to lay waste the estate of Roger de
Mortimer. He himself resided at London; and employing as his instrument,
Fitz-Richard, the seditious mayor, who had violently and illegally prolonged his
authority, he wrought up that city to the highest ferment and agitation. The
populace formed themselves into bands and companies; chose leaders; practised
all military exercises; committed violence on the royalists: And to give them
greater countenance in their disorders, an association was entered into between
the city and eighteen great barons, never to make peace with the king but by
common consent and approbation. At the head of those who swore to maintain this
association, were the earls of Leicester, Glocester, and Derby, with le
|Despenser, the chief justiciary; men who had all previously sworn to submit to
the award of the French monarch. Their only pretence for this breach of faith,
was, that the latter part of Lewis's sentence was, as they affirmed, a
contradiction to the former: He ratified the charter of liberties, yet annulled
the provisions of Oxford; which were only calculated, as they maintained, to
preserve that charter; and without which, in their estimation, they had no
security for its observance.

{#68} ^The^ king and prince, finding a civil war inevitable, prepared themselves
for defence; and summoning the military vassals from all quarters, and being
reinforced by Baliol lord of Galloway, Brus lord of Annandale, Henry Piercy,
John Comyn[n127], and other barons of the north, they composed an army,
formidable as well from its numbers, as its military prowess and experience. The
first enterprize of the royalists was the attack of Northampton, which was
defended by Simon de Montfort, with many of the principal barons of that party:
And a breach being made in the walls by Philip Basset, the place was carried by
assault, and both the governor and the garrison were made prisoners. #5th
April.# The royalists marched thence to Leicester and Nottingham; both which
places having opened their gates to them, prince Edward proceeded with a
detachment into the county of Derby, in order to ravage with fire and sword the
lands of the earl of that name, and take revenge on him for his disloyalty. Like
maxims of war prevailed with both parties throughout England; and the kingdom
was thus exposed in a moment to greater devastation, from the animosities of the
rival barons, than it would have suffered from many years of foreign or even
domestic hostilities, conducted by more humane and more generous principles.

{#69} ^The^ earl of Leicester, master of London, and of the counties in the
south-east of England, formed the siege of Rochester, which alone declared for
the king in those parts, and which, besides earl Warrenne, the governor, was
garrisoned by many noble and powerful barons of the royal party. The king and
prince hastened from Nottingham, where they were then quartered, to the relief
of the place; and on their approach, Leicester raised the siege and retreated to
London, which, being the center of his power, he was |afraid, might, in his
absence, fall into the king's hands, either by force, or by a correspondence
with the principal citizens, who were all secretly inclined to the royal cause.
Reinforced by a great body of Londoners, and having summoned his partizans from
all quarters, he thought himself strong enough to hazard a general battle with
the royalists, and to determine the fate of the nation in one great engagement;
which, if it proved successful, must be decisive against the king, who had no
retreat for his broken troops in those parts; while Leicester himself, in case
of any sinister accident, could easily take shelter in the city. To give the
better colouring to his cause, he previously sent a message with conditions of
peace to Henry, submissive in the language, but exorbitant in the demands[n128];
and when the messenger returned with the lie and defiance from the king, the
prince, and the king of the Romans, he sent a new message, renouncing, in the
name of himself and of the associated barons, all fealty and allegiance to
Henry. He then marched out of the city with his army, divided into four bodies:
The first commanded by his two sons, Henry and Guy de Montfort, together with
Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, who had deserted to the barons; the second
led by the earl of Glocester, with William de Montchesney and John Fitz-John;
the third, composed of Londoners, under the command of Nicholas de Segrave; the
fourth headed by himself in person. The bishop of Chichester gave a general
absolution to the army, accompanied with assurances, that, if any of them fell
in the ensuing action, they would infallibly be received into heaven, as the
reward of their suffering in so meritorious a cause.

{#70} #Battle of Lewes. 14th May.# ^Leicester^, who possessed great talents for
war, conducted his march with such skill and secrecy, that he had well nigh
surprized the royalists in their quarters at Lewes in Sussex: But the vigilance
and activity of prince Edward soon repaired this negligence; and he led out the
king's army to the field in three bodies. He himself conducted the van, attended
by earl Warrenne and William de Valence: The main body was commanded by the king
of the Romans and his son Henry: The king himself was placed in the rear at the
head of his principal nobility. Prince Edward rushed upon the Londoners, who had
demanded the post of honour in leading |the rebel army, but who, from their
ignorance of discipline and want of experience, were ill fitted to resist the
gentry and military men, of whom the prince's body was composed. They were
broken in an instant; were chased off the field; and Edward, transported by his
martial ardour, and eager to revenge the insolence of the Londoners against his
mother[n129], put them to the sword for the length of four miles, without giving
them any quarter, and without reflecting on the fate, which in the mean time
attended the rest of the army. The earl of Leicester, seeing the royalists
thrown into confusion by their eagerness in the pursuit, led on his remaining
troops against the bodies commanded by the two royal brothers: He defeated with
great slaughter the forces headed by the king of the Romans; and that prince was
obliged to yield himself prisoner to the earl of Glocester: He penetrated to the
body, where the king himself was placed, threw it into disorder, pursued his
advantage, chased it into the town of Lewes, and obliged Henry to surrender
himself prisoner[n130].

{#71} ^Prince^ Edward, returning to the field of battle from his precipitate
pursuit of the Londoners, was astonished to find it covered with the dead bodies
of his friends, and still more to hear, that his father and uncle were defeated
and taken prisoners, and that Arundel, Comyn, Brus, Hamon l'Estrange, Roger
Leybourne, and many considerable barons of his party, were in the hands of the
victorious enemy. Earl Warrenne, Hugh Bigod, and William de Valence, struck with
despair at this event, immediately took to flight, hurried to Pevencey, and made
their escape beyond sea[n131]: But the prince, intrepid amidst the greatest
disasters, exhorted his troops to revenge the death of their friends, to relieve
the royal captives, and to snatch an easy conquest from an enemy, disordered by
their own victory[n132]. He found his followers intimidated by their situation;
while Leicester, afraid of a sudden and violent blow from the prince, amused him
by a feigned negociation, till he was able to recal his troops from the pursuit,
and to bring them into order[n133]. There now appeared no farther resource to
the royal party; surrounded by the armies and garrisons of the enemy, destitute
|of forage and provisions, and deprived of their sovereign, as well as of their
principal leaders, who could alone inspirit them to an obstinate resistance. The
prince, therefore, was obliged to submit to Leicester's terms, which were short
and severe, agreeably to the suddenness and necessity of the situation. He
stipulated, that he and Henry d'Allmaine should surrender themselves prisoners
as pledges in lieu of the two kings; that all other prisoners on both sides
should be released[n134]; and that in order to settle fully the terms of
agreement, application should be made to the king of France, that he should name
six Frenchmen, three prelates, and three noblemen: These six to chuse two others
of their own country: And these two to chuse one Englishman, who, in conjunction
with themselves, were to be invested by both parties with full powers to make
what regulations they thought proper for the settlement of the kingdom. The
prince and young Henry accordingly delivered themselves into Leicester's hands,
who sent them under a guard to Dover castle. Such are the terms of agreement,
commonly called the _Mise_ of Lewes, from an obsolete French term of that
meaning: For it appears, that all the gentry and nobility of England, who valued
themselves on their Norman extraction, and who disdained the language of their
native country, made familiar use of the French tongue, till this period, and
for some time after.

{#72} ^Leicester^ had no sooner obtained this great advantage, and gotten the
whole royal family in his power, than he openly violated every article of the
treaty, and acted as sole master, and even tyrant of the kingdom. He still
detained the king in effect a prisoner, and made use of that prince's authority
to purposes the most prejudicial to his interests, and the most oppressive of
his people[n135]. He every where disarmed the royalists, and kept all his own
partizans in a military posture[n136]: He observed the same partial conduct in
the deliverance of the captives, and even threw many of the royalists into
prison, besides those who were taken in the battle of Lewes: He carried the king
from place to place, and obliged all the royal castles, on pretence of Henry's
commands, to receive a governor and garrison of his own appointment: All the
officers of the crown and of the household were named by him; and the whole
authority, |as well as arms of the state, was lodged in his hands: He instituted
in the counties a new kind of magistracy, endowed with new and arbitrary powers,
that of conservators of the peace[n137]: His avarice appeared bare faced, and
might induce us to question the greatness of his ambition, at least the
largeness of his mind, if we had not reason to think, that he intended to employ
his acquisitions as the instruments for attaining farther power and grandeur. He
seized the estates of no less than eighteen barons, as his share of the spoil
gained in the battle of Lewes: He engrossed to himself the ransom of all the
prisoners; and told his barons, with a wanton insolence, that it was sufficient
for them, that he had saved them by that victory from the forfeitures and
attainders which hung over them[n138]: He even treated the earl of Glocester in
the same injurious manner, and applied to his own use the ransom of the king of
the Romans, who in the field of battle had yielded himself prisoner to that
nobleman. Henry, his eldest son, made a monopoly of all the wool in the kingdom,
the only valuable commodity for foreign markets which it at that time
produced[n139]. The inhabitants of the cinque-ports, during the present
dissolution of government, betook themselves to the most licentious piracy,
preyed on the ships of all nations, threw the mariners into the sea, and by
these practices soon banished all merchants from the English coasts and
harbours. Every foreign commodity rose to an exorbitant price; and woollen
cloth, which the English had not then the art of dying, was worn by them white,
and without receiving the last hand of the manufacturer. In answer to the
complaints which arose on this occasion, Leicester replied, that the kingdom
could well enough subsist within itself, and needed no intercourse with
foreigners. And it was found, that he even combined with the pyrates of the
cinque-ports, and received as his share the third of their prizes[n140].

{#73} ^No^ farther mention was made of the reference to the king of France, so
essential an article in the agreement of Lewes; and Leicester summoned a
parliament, composed altogether of his own partizans, in order to rivet, by
their authority, that power, which he had acquired by so much violence, and
which he used with so much tyranny and in justice. An ordinance was there
passed, to which the king's consent had been previously extorted, |that every
act of royal power should be exercised by a council of nine persons, who were to
be chosen and removed by the majority of three, Leicester himself, the earl of
Glocester, and the bishop of Chichester[n141]. By this intricate plan of
government, the scepter was really put into Leicester's hands; as he had the
entire direction of the bishop of Chichester, and thereby commanded all the
resolutions of the council of three, who could appoint or discard at pleasure
every member of the supreme council.

{#74} ^But^ it was impossible that things could long remain in this strange
situation. It behoved Leicester either to descend with some peril into the rank
of a subject, or to mount up with no less into that of a sovereign; and his
ambition, unrestrained either by fear or by principle, gave too much reason to
suspect him of the latter intention. Mean while, he was exposed to anxiety from
every quarter; and felt that the smallest incident was capable of overturning
that immense and ill-cemented fabric, which he had reared. The queen, whom her
husband had left abroad, had collected in foreign parts an army of desperate
adventurers, and had assembled a great number of ships, with a view of invading
the kingdom, and of bringing relief to her unfortunate family. Lewis, detesting
Leicester's usurpations and perjuries, and disgusted at the English barons, who
had refused to submit to his award, secretly favoured all her enterprizes, and
was generally believed to be making preparations for the same purpose. An
English army, by the pretended authority of the captive king, was assembled on
the sea-coast to oppose this projected invasion[n142]; but Leicester owed his
safety more to cross winds, which long detained and at last dispersed and ruined
the queen's fleet, than to any resistance, which, in their present situation,
could have been expected from the English.

{#75} ^Leicester^ found himself better able to resist the spiritual thunders,
which were leveled against him. The pope,. still adhering to the king's cause
against the barons, dispatched cardinal Guido as his legate into England, with
orders to excommunicate by name the three earls, Leicester, Glocester, and
Norfolk, and all others in general, who concurred in the oppression and
captivity of their sovereign[n143]. Leicester menaced the legate with death, if
he set foot within the kingdom; but Guido, meeting in France the bishops of
|Winchester, London, and Worcester, who had been sent thither on a negociation,
commanded them, under the penalty of ecclesiastical censures, to carry his bull
into England, and to publish it against the barons. When the prelates arrived
off the coast, they were boarded by the pyratical mariners of the cinque-ports,
to whom probably they gave a hint of the cargo, which they brought along with
them: The bull was torn and thrown into the sea; which furnished the artful
prelates with a plausible excuse for not obeying the orders of the legate.
Leicester appealed from Guido to the pope in person; but before the ambassadors,
appointed to defend his cause, could reach Rome, the pope was dead; and they
found the legate himself, from whom they had appealed, seated on the papal
throne, by the name of Urban IV. That daring leader was no wise dismayed with
this incident; and as he found that a great part of his popularity in England
was founded on his opposition to the court of Rome, which was now become odious,
he persisted with the more obstinacy in the prosecution of his measures.

{#76} #1265. 20th Jan.# ^That^ he might both encrease, and turn to advantage his
popularity, Leicester summoned a new parliament in London, where, he knew, his
power was uncontrolable; and he fixed this assembly on a more democratical
basis, than any which had ever been summoned since the foundation of the
monarchy. #House of commons.# Besides the barons of his own party, and several
ecclesiastics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown; he ordered returns
to be made of two knights from each shire, and what is more remarkable, of
deputies from the boroughs, an order of men, which in former ages had always
been regarded as too mean to enjoy a place in the national councils[n144]. This
period is commonly esteemed the epoch of the house of commons in England; and it
is certainly the first time that historians speak of any representatives sent to
parliament by the boroughs. In all the general accounts given in preceding times
of those assemblies, the prelates and barons only are mentioned as the
constituent members; and even in the most particular narratives delivered of
parliamentary transactions, as in the trial of Thomas a Becket, where the events
of each day, and almost of each hour, are carefully recorded by contemporary
authors[n145], there is not, throughout the whole, the least appearance of a
house of |commons. But though that house derived its existence from so
precarious and even so invidious an origin as Leicester's usurpation, it soon
proved, when summoned by the legal princes, one of the most useful, and, in
process of time, one of the most powerful members of the national constitution;
and gradually rescued the kingdom from aristocratical as well as from regal
tyranny. But Leicester's policy, if we must ascribe to him so great a blessing,
only forwarded by some years an institution, for which the general state of
things had already prepared the nation; and it is otherwise inconceivable, that
a plant, set by so inauspicious a hand, could have attained to so vigorous a
growth, and have flourished in the midst of such tempests and convulsions. The
feudal system, with which the liberty, much more the power of the commons, was
totally incompatible, began gradually to decline; and both the king and the
commonalty, who felt its inconveniencies, contributed to favour this new power,
which was more submissive than the barons to the regular authority of the crown,
and at the same time afforded protection to the inferior orders of the state.

{#77} ^Leicester^, having thus assembled a parliament of his own model, and
trusting to the attachment of the populace of London, seized the opportunity of
crushing his rivals among the powerful barons. Robert de Ferrars, earl of Derby,
was accused in the king's name, seized, and committed to custody, without being
brought to any legal trial[n146]. John Gifford, menaced with the same fate, fled
from London, and took shelter in the borders of Wales. Even the earl of
Glocester, whose power and influence had so much contributed to the success of
the barons, but who of late was extremely disgusted with Leicester's arbitrary
conduct, found himself in danger from the prevailing authority of his ancient
confederate; and he retired from parliament[n147]. This known dissension gave
courage to all Leicester's enemies and to the king's friends; who were now sure
of protection from so potent a leader. Though Roger Mortimer, Hamon L'Estrange,
and other powerful marchers of Wales, had been obliged to leave the kingdom,
their authority still remained over the territories subjected to their
jurisdiction; and there were many others who were disposed to give disturbance
to |the new government. The animosities, inseparable from the feudal
aristocracy, broke out with fresh violence, and threatened the kingdom with new
convulsions and disorders.

{#78} ^The^ earl of Leicester, surrounded with these difficulties, embraced a
measure, from which he hoped to reap some present advantages, but which proved
in the end the source of all his future calamities. The active and intrepid
prince Edward had languished in prison ever since the fatal battle of Lewes; and
as he was extremely popular in the kingdom, there arose a general desire of
seeing him again restored to liberty[n148]. Leicester finding, that he could
with difficulty oppose the concurring wishes of the nation, stipulated with the
prince, that, in return, he should order his adherents to deliver up to the
barons, all their castles, particularly those on the borders of Wales; and
should swear neither to depart the kingdom during three years, nor introduce
into it any foreign forces[n149]. The king took an oath to the same effect, and
he also passed a charter, in which he confirmed the agreement or _Mise_ of
Lewes; and even permitted his subjects to rise in arms against him, if he should
ever attempt to infringe it[n150]. So little care did Leicester take, though he
constantly made use of the authority of this captive prince, to preserve to him
any appearance of royalty or kingly prerogatives!

{#79} #11th March.# ^In^ consequence of this treaty, prince Edward was brought
into Westminster-hall, and was declared free by the barons: But instead of
really recovering his liberty, as he had vainly expected, he found, that the
whole transaction was a fraud on the part of Leicester; that he himself still
continued a prisoner at large, and was guarded by the emissaries of that
nobleman; and that, while the faction reaped all the benefit from the
performance of his part of the treaty, care was taken that he should enjoy no
advantage by it. As Glocester, on his rupture with the barons, had retired for
safety to his estates on the borders of Wales; Leicester followed him with an
army to Hereford[n151], continued still to menace and negotiate, and that he
might add authority to his cause, he carried both the king and prince along with
him. The earl of Glocester here concerted with young Edward the manner of that
prince's escape. He found |means to convey to him a horse of extraordinary
swiftness; and appointed Roger Mortimer, who had returned into the kingdom, to
be ready at hand with a small party to receive the prince, and to guard him to a
place of safety. Edward pretended to take the air with some of Leicester's
retinue, who were his guards; and making #28th May.# matches between their
horses, after he thought he had tired and blown them sufficiently, he suddenly
mounted Glocester's horse, and called to his attendants, that he had long enough
enjoyed the pleasure of their company, and now bid them adieu. They followed him
for some time, without being able to overtake him; and the appearance of
Mortimer with his company put an end to their pursuit.

{#80} ^The^ royalists, secretly prepared for this event, immediately flew to
arms; and the joy of this gallant prince's deliverance, the oppressions under
which the nation laboured, the expectation of a new scene of affairs, and the
countenance of the earl of Glocester, procured Edward an army which Leicester
was utterly unable to withstand. This nobleman found himself in a remote quarter
of the kingdom; surrounded by his enemies; barred from all communication with
his friends by the Severne, whose bridges Edward had broken down; and obliged to
fight the cause of his party under these multiplied disadvantages. In this
extremity he wrote to his son, Simon de Montfort, to hasten from London with an
army for his relief; and Simon had advanced to Kenilworth with that view, where,
fancying that all Edward's force and attention were directed against his father,
he lay secure and unguarded. But the prince, making a sudden and forced march,
surprized him in his camp, dispersed his army, and took the earl of Oxford, and
many other noblemen prisoners, almost without resistance. Leicester, ignorant of
his son's fate, passed the Severne in boats during Edward's absence, and lay at
Evesham, in expectation of being every hour joined by his friends from London:
When the prince, who availed himself of every favourable moment, appeared in the
field before him. Edward made a body of his troops advance from the road which
led to Kenilworth, and ordered them to carry the #Battle of Evesham, and death
of Leicester. 4th August.# banners taken from Simon's army; while he himself,
making a circuit with the rest of his forces, purposed to attack the enemy on
the other quarter. Leicester was long deceived by this stratagem, and took one
division of Edward's army for his friends; but at last, perceiving his mistake,
and observing the great superiority and |excellent disposition of the royalists,
he exclaimed, that they had learned from him the art of war; adding, "The Lord
have mercy on our souls, for I see our bodies are the prince's." The battle
immediately began, though on very unequal terms. Leicester's army, by living in
the mountains of Wales without bread, which was not then much used among the
inhabitants, had been extremely weakened by sickness and desertion, and was soon
broken by the victorious royalists; while his Welsh allies, accustomed only to a
desultory kind of war, immediately took to flight, and were pursued with great
slaughter. Leicester himself, asking for quarter, was slain in the heat of the
action, with his eldest son Henry, Hugh le Despenser, and about one hundred and
sixty knights, and many other gentlemen of his party. The old king had been
purposely placed by the rebels in the front of the battle; and being clad in
armour, and thereby not known by his friends, he received a wound, and was in
danger of his life: But crying out _I am Henry of Winchester, your king,_ he was
saved; and put in a place of safety by his son, who flew to his rescue.

{#81} ^The^ violence, ingratitude, tyranny, rapacity and treachery of the earl
of Leicester, gave a very bad idea of his moral character, and make us regard
his death as the most fortunate event, which, in this conjuncture, could have
happened to the English nation: Yet must we allow the man to have possessed
great abilities, and the appearance of great virtues, who, though a stranger,
could, at a time when strangers were the most odious, and the most universally
decried, have acquired so extensive an interest in the kingdom, and have so
nearly paved his way to the throne itself. His military capacity, and his
political craft, were equally eminent: He possessed the talents both of
governing men and conducting business: And though his ambition was boundless, it
seems neither to have exceeded his courage nor his genius; and he had the
happiness of making the low populace, as well as the haughty barons, co-operate
towards the success of his selfish and dangerous purposes. A prince of greater
abilities and vigour than Henry might have directed the talents of this nobleman
either to the exaltation of his throne, or to the good of his people: But the
advantages given to Leicester, by the weak and variable administration of the
king, brought on the ruin of royal authority, and produced great confusions in
the kingdom, which however in the end preserved |and extremely improved national
liberty, and the constitution. His popularity, even after his death, continued
so great, that, though he was excommunicated by Rome, the people believed him to
be a saint; and many miracles were said to be wrought upon his tomb[n152].

{#82} #Settlement of the government.# ^The^ victory of Evesham, with the death
of Leicester, proved decisive in favour of the royalists, and made an equal,
though an opposite impression on friends and enemies, in every part of England.
The king of the Romans recovered his liberty: The other prisoners of the royal
party were not only freed, but courted, by their keepers: Fitz-Richard, the
seditious mayor of London, who had marked out forty of the most wealthy citizens
for slaughter, immediately stopped his hand on receiving intelligence of this
great event: And almost all the castles, garrisoned by the barons, hastened to
make their submissions, and to open their gates to the king. The isle of Axholme
alone, and that of Ely, trusting to the strength of their situation, ventured to
make resistance; but were at last reduced, as well as the castle of Dover, by
the valour and #1266.# activity of prince Edward[n153]. Adam de Gourdon, a
courageous baron, maintained himself during some time in the forests of
Hampshire, committed depredations in the neighbourhood, and obliged the prince
to lead a body of troops into that country against him. Edward attacked the camp
of the rebels; and being transported by the ardour of battle, leaped over the
trench with a few followers, and encountered Gourdon in single combat. The
victory was long disputed between these valiant combatants; but ended at last in
the prince's favour, who wounded his antagonist, threw him from his horse, and
took him prisoner. He not only gave him his life; but introduced him that very
night to the queen at Guilford, procured him his pardon, restored him to his
estate, received him into favour, and was ever after faithfully served by
him[n154].

{#83} ^A^ total victory of the sovereign over so extensive a rebellion commonly
produces a revolution of government, and strengthens, as well as enlarges, for
some time, the prerogatives of the crown: Yet no sacrifices of natonal liberty
were made on this occasion; the Great Charter remained still inviolate; and the
king, sensible that his own barons, by whose assistance alone he had prevailed,
were |no less jealous of their independance than the other party, seems thence
forth to have more carefully abstained from all those exertions of power, which
had afforded so plausible a pretence to the rebels. The clemency of this victory
is also remarkable: No blood was shed on the scaffold: No attainders, except of
the Mountfort family, were carried into execution: And though a parliament,
assembled at Winchester, attainted all those, who had borne arms against the
king, easy compositions were made with them for their lands[n155]; and the
highest sum, levied on the most obnoxious offenders, exceeded not five years
rent of their estate. Even the earl of Derby, who again rebelled, after having
been pardoned and restored to his fortune, was obliged to pay only seven years'
rent, and was a second time restored. The mild disposition of the king, and the
prudence of the prince, tempered the insolence of victory, and gradually
restored order to the several members of the state, disjointed by so long a
continuance of civil wars and commotions.

{#84} ^The^ city of London, which had carried farthest the rage and animosity
against the king, and which seemed determined to stand upon its defence after
almost all the kingdom had submitted, was, after some interval, restored to most
of its liberties and privileges; and Fitz-Richard, the mayor, who had been
guilty of so much illegal violence, was only punished by fine and imprisonment.
The countess of Leicester, the king's sister, who had been extremely forward in
all attacks on the royal family, was dismissed the kingdom with her two sons,
Simon and Guy, who proved very ungrateful for this lenity. Five years
afterwards, they assassinated, at Viterbo in Italy, their cousin Henry
d'Allmaine, who at that very time was endeavouring to make their peace with the
king; and by taking sanctuary in the church of the Franciscans, they escaped the
punishment due to so great an enormity[n156].

{#85} #1267.# ^The^ merits of the earl of Glocester, after he returned to his
allegiance, had been so great, in restoring the prince to his liberty, and
assisting him in his victories against the rebellious barons, that it was almost
impossible to content him in his demands; and his youth and temerity, as well as
his great power, tempted him, on some new disgust, to raise again the flames of
rebellion in the |kingdom. The mutinous populace of London, at his instigation,
took to arms; and the prince was obliged to levy an army of 30,000 men, in order
to suppress them. Even this second rebellion did not provoke the king to any act
of cruelty; and the earl of Glocester himself escaped with total impunity. He
was only obliged to enter into a bond of 20,000 marks, that he should never
again be guilty of rebellion: A strange method of enforcing the laws, and a
proof of the dangerous independance of the barons in those ages! These potent
nobles were, from the danger of the precedent, averse to the execution of the
laws of forfeiture and felony against any of their fellows; though they could
not with a good grace refuse to concur in obliging them to fulfil any voluntary
contract and engagement, into which they had entered.

{#86} #1270.# ^The^ prince finding the state of the kingdom tolerably composed,
was seduced, by his avidity for glory, and by the prejudices of the age, as well
as by the earnest solicitations of the king of France, to undertake an
expedition against the infidels in the Holy Land[n157]; and he endeavoured
previously to settle the state in such a manner, as to dread no bad effects from
his absence. As the formidable power and turbulent disposition of the earl of
Glocester gave him apprehensions, he insisted on carrying him along with him, in
consequence of a vow, which that nobleman had made to undertake the same voyage:
In the mean time, he obliged him to resign some of his castles, and to enter
into a new bond not to disturb the peace of the kingdom[n158]. He sailed from
England with an army; and arrived in Lewis's camp before Tunis in Africa, where
he found that monarch already dead, from the intemperance of the climate and the
fatigues of his enterprize. The great, if not only weakness of this prince in
his government was the imprudent passion for crusades; but it was this zeal
chiefly that procured him from the clergy the title of St. Lewis, by which he is
known in the French history; and if that appellation had not been so extremely
prostituted, as to become rather a term of reproach, he seems, by his uniform
probity and goodness, as well as his piety, to have fully merited the title. He
was succeeded by his son, Philip, denominated the Hardy; a prince of some merit,
though much inferior to that of his father.

{#87} #1271.# ^Prince^ Edward, not discouraged by this event, continued his
voyage to the Holy Land, where he signalized himself by acts of valour: Revived
the glory of the English name in those parts: And struck such terror into the
Saracens, that they employed an assassin to murder him, who wounded him in the
arm, but perished in the attempt[n159]. Meanwhile, his absence from England was
attended with many of those pernicious consequences, which had been dreaded from
it. The laws were not executed: The barons oppressed the common people with
impunity[n160]: They gave shelter on their estates to bands of robbers, whom
they employed in committing ravages on the estates of their enemies: The
populace of London returned to their usual licentiousness: And the old king,
unequal to the burthen of public affairs, called aloud for his gallant son to
return[n161], and to assist him in swaying that scepter, which was ready to drop
from his feeble and irresolute hands. #1272. 16th Nov. Death and character of
the king.# At last, overcome by the cares of government, and the infirmities of
age, he visibly declined, and he expired at St. Edmondsbury in the 64th year of
his age, and 56th of his reign; the longest reign that is to be met with in the
English annals. His brother, the king of the Romans (for he never attained the
title of emperor) died about seven months before him.

{#88} ^The^ most obvious circumstance of Henry's character is his incapacity for
government, which rendered him as much a prisoner in the hands of his own
ministers and favourites, and as little at his own disposal, as when detained a
captive in the hands of his enemies. From this source, rather than from
insincerity or treachery, arose his negligence in observing his promises; and he
was too easily induced, for the sake of present convenience, to sacrifice the
lasting advantages arising from the trust and confidence of his people. Hence
too were derived his profusion to favourites, his attachment to strangers, the
variableness of his conduct, his hasty resentments, and his sudden forgiveness
and return of affection. Instead of reducing the dangerous power of his nobles,
by obliging them to observe the laws towards their inferiors, and setting them
the salutary example in his own government; he was seduced to imitate their
conduct, and to make his arbitrary will, or rather that |of his ministers, the
rule of his actions. Instead of accommodating himself, by a strict frugality, to
the embarrassed situation in which his revenue had been left, by the military
expeditions of his uncle, the dissipations of his father, and the usurpations of
the barons; he was tempted to levy money by irregular exactions, which, without
enriching himself, impoverished, at least disgusted his people. Of all men,
nature seemed least to have fitted him for being a tyrant; yet are there
instances of oppression in his reign, which, though derived from the precedents,
left him by his predecessors, had been carefully guarded against by the Great
Charter, and are inconsistent with all rules of good government. And on the
whole we may say, that greater abilities, with his good dispositions, would have
prevented him from falling into his faults; or with worse dispositions, would
have enabled him to maintain and defend them.

{#89} ^This^ prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and his regular
attendance on public worship; and a saying of his on that head is much
celebrated by ancient writers. He was engaged in a dispute with Lewis IX. of
France, concerning the preference between sermons and masses: He maintained the
superiority of the latter, and affirmed, that he would rather have one hour's
conversation with a friend, than hear twenty the most elaborate discourses,
pronounced in his praise[n162].

{#90} ^Henry^ left two sons, Edward his successor, and Edmond earl of Lancaster;
and two daughters, Margaret queen of Scotland, and Beatrix dutchess of Britanny.
He had five other children, who died in their infancy.

{#91} #Miscellaneous transactions of this reign.# ^The^ following are the most
remarkable laws enacted during this reign. There had been great disputes between
the civil and ecclesiastical courts concerning bastardy. The common law had
deemed all those to be bastards who were born before wedlock: By the canon law
they were legitimate: And when any dispute of inheritance arose, it had formerly
been usual for the civil courts to issue writs to the spiritual, directing them
to enquire into the legitimacy of the person. The bishop always returned an
answer agreeable to the canon law, though contrary to the municipal law of the
kingdom. For this reason, the civil courts had changed the |terms of their writ;
and instead of requiring the spiritual courts to make inquisition concerning the
legitimacy of the person, they only proposed the simple question of fact,
whether he were born before or after wedlock. The prelates complained of this
practice to the parliament assembled at Merton in the twentieth of this king,
and desired that the municipal law might be rendered conformable to the canon:
But received from all the nobility the memorable reply, _Nolumus leges Angliae
mutare,_ We will not change the laws of England[n163].

{#92} ^After^ the civil wars, the parliament summoned at Marlebridge, gave their
approbation to most of the ordinances, which had been established by the
reforming barons, and which, though advantageous to the security of the people,
had not received the sanction of a legal authority. Among other laws, it was
there enacted, that all appeals from the courts of inferior lords should be
carried directly to the king's courts, without passing through the courts of the
lords immediately superior[n164]. It was ordained, that money should bear no
interest during the minority of the debtor[n165]. This law was reasonable, as
the estates of minors were always in the hands of their lords, and the debtors
could not pay interest where they had no revenue. The charter of king John had
granted this indulgence: It was omitted in that of Henry III. for what reason is
not known; but it was renewed by the statute of Marlebridge. Most of the other
articles of this statute are calculated to restrain the oppressions of sheriffs,
and the violence and iniquities committed in distraining cattle and other goods.
Cattle and the instruments of husbandry formed at that time the chief riches of
the people.

{#93} ^In^ the 35th year of this king an assize was fixed of bread, the price of
which was settled, according to the different prices of corn, from one shilling
a quarter to seven shillings and sixpence[n166], money of that age. These great
variations are alone a proof of bad tillage[n167]: Yet did the prices often rise
much higher, than any taken |notice of by the statute. The chronicle of
Dunstable tells us, that in this reign, wheat was once sold for a mark, nay for
a pound a quarter; that is, three pounds of our present money[n168]. The same
law affords us a proof of the little communication between the parts of the
kingdom, from the very different prices which the same commodity bore at the
same time. A brewer, says the statute, may sell two gallons of ale for a penny
in cities, and three or four gallons for the same price in the country. At
present, such commodities, by the great consumption of the people, and the great
stocks of the brewers, are rather cheapest in cities. The Chronicle
above-mentioned observes, that wheat one year was sold in many places for eight
shillings a quarter, but never rose in Dunstable above a crown.

{#94} ^Though^ commerce was still very low, it seems rather to have encreased
since the Conquest; at least, if we may judge of the increase of money by the
price of corn. The medium between the highest and lowest prices of wheat,
assigned by the statute, is four shillings and three pence a quarter, that is,
twelve shillings and nine pence of our present money. This is near half of the
middling price in our time. Yet the middling price of cattle, so late as the
reign of king Richard, we found to be above eight, near ten times lower than the
present. Is not this the true inference, from comparing these facts, that, in
all uncivilized nations, cattle, which propagate of themselves, bear always a
lower price than corn, which requires more art and stock to render it plentiful,
than those nations are possessed of? It is to be remarked, that Henry's assize
of corn was copied from a preceding assize established by king John;
consequently, the prices which we have here compared of corn and cattle may be
looked on as contemporary; and they were drawn, not from one particular year,
but from an estimation of the middling prices for a series of years. It is true,
the prices, assigned by the assize of Richard, were meant as a standard for the
accompts of sheriffs and escheators; and as considerable profits were allowed to
these ministers, we may naturally suppose, that the common value of cattle was
somewhat higher: Yet still, so great a difference between the prices of corn and
cattle as that of four to one, compared to the present rates, affords important
reflections |concerning the very different state of industry and tillage in the
two periods.

{#95} ^Interest^ had in that age mounted to an enormous height, as might be
expected from the barbarism of the times and men's ignorance of commerce.
Instances occur of fifty per cent. payed for money[n169]. There is an edict of
Philip Augustus near this period, limiting the Jews in France to 48 per
cent[n170]. Such profits tempted the Jews to remain in the kingdom,
notwithstanding the grievous oppressions, to which, from the prevalent bigotry
and rapine of the age, they were continually exposed. It is easy to imagine how
precarious their state must have been under an indigent prince, somewhat
restrained in his tyranny over his native subjects, but who possessed an
unlimited authority over the Jews, the sole proprietors of money in the kingdom,
and hated on account of their riches, their religion, and their usury: Yet will
our ideas scarcely come up to the extortions which in fact we find to have been
practised upon them. In the year 1241, 20,000 marks were exacted from
them[n171]: Two years after, money was again extorted; and one Jew alone, Aaron
of York, was obliged to pay above 4000 marks[n172]: In 1250, Henry renewed his
oppressions; and the same Aaron was condemned to pay him 30,000 marks upon an
accusation of forgery[n173]: The high penalty imposed upon him, and which, it
seems, he was thought able to pay, is rather a presumption of his innocence than
of his guilt. In 1255, the king demanded 8000 marks from the Jews, and
threatened to hang them, if they refused compliance. They now lost all patience,
and desired leave to retire with their effects out of the kingdom. But the king
replied: "How can I remedy the oppressions you complain of? I am myself a
beggar. I am spoiled, I am stripped of all my revenues: I owe above 200,000
marks; and if I had said 300,000, I should not exceed the truth: I am obliged to
pay my son, prince Edward, 15,000 marks a year: I have not a farthing; and I
must have money, from any hand, from any quarter, or by any means." He then
delivered over the Jews to the earl of Cornwal, that those whom the one brother
had flead, the other might embowel, to make use of the words of the
historian[n174]. King John, his father, once demanded 10,000 marks |from a Jew
of Bristol; and on his refusal, ordered one of his teeth to be drawn every day
till he should comply. The Jew lost seven teeth; and then paid the sum required
of him[n175]. One talliage laid upon the Jews in 1243 amounted to 60,000
marks[n176]; a sum equal to the whole yearly revenue of the crown.

{#96} ^To^ give a better pretence for extortions, the improbable and absurd
accusation, which has been at different times advanced against that nation, was
revived in England, that they had crucified a child in derision of the
sufferings of Christ. Eighteen of them were hanged at once for this crime[n177]:
Though it is no wise credible, that even the antipathy born them by the
Christians, and the oppressions under which they laboured, would ever have
pushed them to be guilty of that dangerous enormity. But it is natural to
imagine, that a race, exposed to such insults and indignities both from king and
people, and who had so uncertain an enjoyment of their riches, would carry usury
to the utmost extremity, and by their great profits make themselves some
compensation for their continual perils.

{#97} ^Though^ these acts of violence against the Jews proceeded much from
bigotry, they were still more derived from avidity and rapine. So far from
desiring in that age to convert them, it was enacted by law in France, that, if
any Jew embraced Christianity, he forfeited all his goods, without exception, to
the king or his superior lord. These plunderers were careful, lest the profits,
accruing from their dominion over that unhappy race, should be diminished by
their conversion[n178].

{#98} ^Commerce^ must be in a wretched condition, where interest was so high,
and where the sole proprietors of money employed it in usury only, and were
exposed to such extortion and injustice. But the bad police of the country was
another obstacle to improvements; and rendered all communication dangerous, and
all property precarious. The Chronicle of Dunstable says[n179], that men were
never secure in their houses, and that whole villages were often plundered by
bands of robbers, though no civil wars at that time prevailed in the kingdom. In
1249, some years before the insurrection of the barons, two merchants of Brabant
came to the king |at Winchester, and told him, that they had been spoiled of all
their goods by certain robbers, whom they knew, because they saw their faces
every day in his court; that like practices prevailed all over England, and
travellers were continually exposed to the danger of being robbed, bound,
wounded, and murdered; that these crimes escaped with impunity, because the
ministers of justice themselves were in a confederacy with the robbers; and that
they, for their part, instead of bringing matters to a fruitless trial by law,
were willing, though merchants, to decide their cause with the robbers by arms
and a duel. The king, provoked at these abuses, ordered a jury to be inclosed,
and to try the robbers: The jury, though consisting of twelve men of property in
Hampshire, were found to be also in a confederacy with the felons, and acquitted
them. Henry in a rage committed the jury to prison, threatened them with severe
punishment, and ordered a new jury to be inclosed, who, dreading the fate of
their fellows, at last found a verdict against the criminals. Many of the king's
own household were discovered to have participated in the guilt; and they said
for their excuse, that they received no wages from him, and were obliged to rob
for a maintenance[n180]. _Knights and esquires,_ says the Dictum of Kenelworth,
_who were robbers, if they have no land, shall pay the half of their goods, and
find sufficient security to keep henceforth the peace of the kingdom._ Such were
the manners of the times!

{#99} ^One^ can the less repine, during the prevalence of such manners, at the
frauds and forgeries of the clergy; as it gives less disturbance to society, to
take men's money from them with their own consent, though by deceits and lies,
than to ravish it by open force and violence. During this reign, the papal power
was at its summit, and was even beginning insensibly to decline, by reason of
the immeasurable avarice and extortions of the court of Rome, which disgusted
the clergy as well as laity, in every kingdom of Europe. England itself, though
sunk in the deepest abyss of ignorance and superstition, had seriously
entertained thoughts of shaking off the papal yoke[n181]; and the Roman pontiff
was obliged to think of new expedients for rivetting it faster upon the
Christian world. For this purpose, Gregory IX. published his decretals[n182],
|which are a collection of forgeries, favourable to the court of Rome, and
consist of the supposed decrees of popes in the first centuries. But these
forgeries are so gross, and confound so palpably all language, history,
chronology, and antiquities; matters more stubborn than any speculative truths
whatsoever; that even that church, which is not startled at the most monstrous
contradictions and absurdities, has been obliged to abandon them to the critics.
But in the dark period of the thirteenth century, they passed for undisputed and
authentic; and men, entangled in the mazes of this false literature, joined to
the philosophy, equally false, of the times, had nothing wherewithal to defend
themselves, but some small remains of common sense, which passed for profaneness
and impiety, and the indelible regard to self-interest, which, as it was the
sole motive in the priests for framing these impostures, served also, in some
degree, to protect the laity against them.

{#100} ^Another^ expedient, devised by the church of Rome, in this period, for
securing her power, was the institution of new religious orders, chiefly the
Dominicans and Franciscans, who proceeded with all the zeal and success that
attend novelties; were better qualified to gain the populace than the old
orders, now become rich and indolent; maintained a perpetual rivalship with each
other in promoting their gainful superstitions; and acquired a great dominion
over the minds, and consequently over the purses of men, by pretending a desire
of poverty and a contempt for riches. The quarrels which arose between these
orders, lying still under the controul of the sovereign pontiff, never disturbed
the peace of the church, and served only as a spur to their industry in
promoting the common cause; and though the Dominicans lost some popularity by
their denial of the immaculate conception, a point in which they unwarily
engaged too far to be able to recede with honour, they counterbalanced this
disadvantage by acquiring more solid establishments, by gaining the confidence
of kings and princes, and by exercising the jurisdiction assigned them, of
ultimate judges and punishers of heresy. Thus, the several orders of monks
became a kind of regular troops or garrisons of the Romish church; and though
the temporal interests of society, still more the cause of true piety, were
hurt, by their various devices to captivate |the populace, they proved the chief
supports of that mighty fabric of superstition, and, till the revival of true
learning, secured it from any dangerous invasion.

{#101} ^The^ trial by ordeal was abolished in this reign by order of council: A
faint mark of improvement in the age[n183].

{#102} ^Henry^ granted a charter to the town of Newcastle, in which he gave the
inhabitants a licence to dig coal. This is the first mention of coal in England.

{#103} ^We^ learn from Madox[n184], that this king gave at one time 100
shillings to master Henry, his poet: Also the same year he orders this poet ten
pounds.

{#104} ^It^ appears from Selden, that in the 47th of this reign a hundred and
fifty temporal, and fifty spiritual barons were summoned to perform the service,
due by their tenures[n185]. In the 35th of the subsequent reign eighty-six
temporal barons, twenty bishops, and forty-eight abbots, were summoned to a
parliament convened at Carlisle[n186].

{#n80} M. Paris, p. 638. The same author, a few pages before, makes Richard's
treasures amount to little more than half the sum, p. 634. The king's
dissipations and expences, throughout his whole reign, according to the same
author, had amounted only to about 940,000 marks, p. 638.

{#n81} The sums mentioned by ancient authors, who were almost all monks, are
often improbable, and never consistent. But we know from an infallible
authority, the public remonstrance to the council of Lyons, that the king's
revenues were below 60,000 marks a year: His brother therefore could never have
been master of 700,000 marks; especially as he did not sell his estates in
England, as we learn from the same author: And we hear afterwards of his
ordering all his woods to be cut, in order to satisfy the rapacity of the German
princes: His son succeeded to the earldom of Cornwal and his other revenues.

{#n167} We learn from Cicero's orations against Verres, lib. iii. cap. 84, 92,
that the price of corn in Sicily was, during the praetorship of Sacerdos, five
Denarii a Modius; during that of Verres, which immediately succeeded, only two
Sesterces: That is, ten times lower; a presumption, or rather a proof, of the
very bad state of tillage in ancient times.
