{#1} #1547. State of the regency.# THE late king, by the regulations, which he
imposed on the government of his infant son, as well as by the limitations of
the succession, had projected to reign even after his decease; and he imagined,
that his ministers, who had always been so obsequious to him during his
life-time, would never afterwards depart from the plan, which he had traced out
to them. He fixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his eighteenth
year; and as Edward was then only a few months past nine, he appointed sixteen
executors; to whom, during the minority, he entrusted |the government of the
king and kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury; lord
Wriothesely, chancellor; lord St. John, great master; lord Russel, privy seal;
the earl of Hertford, chamberlain; viscount Lisle, admiral; Tonstal, bishop of
Durham; Sir Anthony Brown, master of horse; Sir William Paget, secretary of
state; Sir Edward North, chancellor of the court of augmentations; Sir Edward
Montague, chief justice of the common pleas; judge Bromley, Sir Anthony Denny,
and Sir William Herbert, chief gentlemen of the privy chamber; Sir Edward
Wotton, treasurer of Calais; Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury. To these executors,
with whom was entrusted the whole regal authority, were appointed twelve
counsellors, who possessed no immediate power, and could only assist with their
advice, when any affair was laid before them. The council was composed of the
earls of Arundel and Essex; Sir Thomas Cheyney, treasurer of the household; Sir
John Gage, comptroller; Sir Anthony Wingfield, vice-chamberlain; Sir William
Petre, secretary of state; Sir Richard Rich, Sir John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler,
Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard Southwel, and Sir Edmund Peckham[n1]. The usual
caprice of Henry appears somewhat in this nomination; while he appointed several
persons of inferior station among his executors, and gave only the place of
counsellor to a person of such high rank as the earl of Arundel, and to Sir
Thomas Seymour the king's uncle.

{#2} #Innovations in the regency.# ^But^ the first act of the executors and
counsellors was to depart from the destination of the late king in a material
article. No sooner were they met, than it was suggested, that the government
would lose its dignity, for want of some head, who might represent the royal
majesty, who might receive addresses from foreign ambassadors, to whom
dispatches from English ministers abroad might be carried, and whose name might
be employed in all orders and proclamations: And as the king's will seemed to
labour under a defect in this particular, it was deemed necessary to supply it,
by chusing a protector; who, though he should possess all the exterior symbols
of royal dignity, should yet be bound, in every act of power, to follow the
opinion of the executors[n2]. This proposal was very disagreeable to chancellor
Wriothesely. That magistrate, a |man of an active spirit and high ambition,
found himself, by his office, entitled to the first rank in the regency after
the primate; and as he knew, that this prelate had no talent or inclination for
state affairs, he hoped, that the direction of public business would of course
devolve in a great measure upon himself. He opposed, therefore, the proposal of
chusing a protector; and represented that innovation as an infringement of the
late king's will, which, being corroborated by act of parliament, ought in every
thing to be a law to them, and could not be altered but by the same authority,
which had established it. But he seems to have stood alone in the opposition.
The executors and counsellors were mostly courtiers, who had been raised by
Henry's favour, not men of high birth or great hereditary influence; and as they
had been sufficiently accustomed to submission during the reign of the late
monarch, and had no pretensions to govern the nation by their own authority,
they acquiesced the more willingly in a proposal, which seemed calculated for
preserving public peace and tranquillity. It being therefore agreed to name a
protector, the choice fell of course on the earl of Hertford, #Hertford
protector.# who, as he was the king's maternal uncle, was strongly interested in
his safety; and possessing no claims to inherit the crown, could never have any
separate interest, which might lead him to endanger Edward's person or his
authority[n3]. The public was informed by proclamation of this change in the
administration; and dispatches were sent to all foreign courts to give them
intimation of it. All those who were possessed of any office resigned their
former commissions, and accepted new ones in the name of the young king. The
bishops themselves were constrained to make a like submission. Care was taken to
insert in their new commissions, that they held their office during
pleasure[n4]. And it is there expressly affirmed, that all manner of authority
and jurisdiction, as well ecclesiastical as civil, is originally derived from
the crown[n5].

{#3} ^The^ executors, in their next measure, showed a more submissive deference
to Henry's will; because many of them found their account in it. The late king
had intended, before his death, to make a new creation of nobility, in order to
supply the place of |those peerages, which had fallen by former attainders, or
the failure of issue; and that he might enable the new peers to support their
dignity, he had resolved, either to bestow estates on them, or advance them to
higher offices. He had even gone so far as to inform them of this resolution;
and in his will, he charged his executors to make good all his promises[n6].
That they might ascertain his intentions in the most authentic manner, Sir
William Paget, Sir Anthony Denny, and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had
always conversed in a familiar manner, were called before the board of regency;
and having given evidence of what they knew concerning the king's promises,
their testimony was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the fulfilling of
these engagements. #17th Feb.# Hertford was created duke of Somerset, marschal
and lord treasurer; Wriothesely, earl of Southampton; the earl of Essex,
marquess of Northampton; viscount Lisle, earl of Warwic; Sir Thomas Seymour,
lord Seymour of Sudley, and admiral; Sir Richard Rich, Sir William Willoughby,
Sir Edward Sheffield accepted the title of baron[n7]. Several to whom the same
dignity was offered, refused it; because the other part of the king's promise,
the bestowing of estates on these new noblemen, was deferred till a more
convenient opportunity. Some of them, however, as also Somerset the protector,
were, in the mean time, endowed with spiritual preferments, deaneries and
prebends. For among many other invasions of ecclesiastical privileges and
property, this irregular practice, of bestowing spiritual benefices on laymen,
began now to prevail.

{#4} ^The^ earl of Southampton had always been engaged in an opposite party to
Somerset; and it was not likely that factions, which had secretly prevailed,
even during the arbitrary reign of Henry, should be suppressed in the weak
administration, that usually attends a minority. The former nobleman, that he
might have the greater leisure for attending to public business, had, of himself
and from his own authority, put the great seal in commission, and had empowered
four lawyers, Southwell, Tregonel, Oliver, and Bellasis, to execute in his
absence the office of chancellor. This measure seemed very exceptionable; and
the more so, as, two of the commissioners being canonists, the lawyers
suspected, that, by |this nomination, the chancellor had intended to discredit
the common law. Complaints were made to the council; who, influenced by the
protector, gladly laid hold of the opportunity to depress Southampton. They
consulted the judges with regard to so unusual a case, and received for answer,
that the commission was illegal, and that the chancellor, by his presumption in
granting it, had justly forfeited the great seal, and was even liable to
punishment. The council summoned him to appear before them. He maintained, that
he held his office by the late king's will, founded on an act of parliament, and
could not lose it without a trial in parliament; that if the commission, which
he had granted, were found illegal, it might be cancelled, and all the ill
consequences of it be easily remedied; and that the depriving him of his office
for an error of this nature, was a precedent by which any other innovation might
be authorized. But the council, notwithstanding these topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited the great seal; that a fine should be imposed
upon him; and that he should be confined to his own house during pleasure[n8];

{#5} ^The^ removal of Southampton encreased the protector's authority, as well
as tended to suppress faction in the regency; yet was not Somerset contented
with this advantage: His ambition carried him to seek still farther
acquisitions. On pretence, that the vote of the executors, choosing him
protector, was not a sufficient foundation for his authority, he procured a
patent from the young king, by which he entirely overturned the will of Harry
VIII, #12 March.# produced a total revolution in the government, and may seem
even to have subverted all the laws of the kingdom. He named himself protector
with full regal power, and appointed a council, consisting of all the former
counsellors, and all the executors, except Southampton: He reserved a power of
naming any other counsellors at pleasure: And he was bound to consult with such
only as he thought proper. The protector and his council were likewise empowered
to act at discretion, and to execute whatever they deemed for the public
service, without incurring any penalty or forfeiture from any law, statute,
proclamation, or ordinance whatsoever[n9]. Even had this patent been more
moderate in its concessions, and had it been drawn by direction, from the
executors appointed by Henry, its |legality might justly be questioned; since it
seems essential to a trust of this nature to be exercised by the persons
entrusted, and not to admit of a delegation to others: But as the patent, by its
very tenor, where the executors are not so much as mentioned, appears to have
been surreptitiously obtained from a minor King, the protectorship of Somerset
was a plain usurpation, which it is impossible by any arguments to justify. The
connivance, however, of the executors, and their present acquiescence in the new
establishment, made it be universally submitted to; and as the young king
discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was also in the main a man of
moderation and probity, no objections were made to his power and title. All men
of sense, likewise, who saw the nation divided by the religious zeal of the
opposite sects, deemed it the more necessary to entrust the government to one
person, who might check the exorbitancies of faction, and ensure the public
tranquillity. And though some clauses of the patent seemed to imply a formal
subversion of all limited government, so little jealousy was then usually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever taken at bare claims or
pretensions of this nature, advanced by any person possessed of sovereign power.
The actual exercise alone of arbitrary administration, and that in many and
great and flagrant and unpopular instances, was able sometimes to give some
umbrage to the nation.

{#6} #Reformation completed.# ^The^ extensive authority and imperious character
of Henry had retained the partizans of both religions in subjection; but upon
his demise, the hopes of the protestants and the fears of the catholics began to
revive, and the zeal of these parties produced every where disputes and
animosities, the usual preludes to more fatal divisions. The protector had long
been regarded as a secret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed from
restraint, he scrupled not to discover his intention of correcting all abuses in
the ancient religion, and of adopting still more of the protestant innovations.
He took care, that all persons, entrusted with the king's education, should be
attached to the same principles; and as the young prince discovered a zeal for
every kind of literature, especially the theological, far beyond his tender
years, all men foresaw, in the course of his reign, the total abolition of the
catholic faith in England; and they early began to declare themselves in favour
of those tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely prevalent.
After |Southampton's fall, few members of the council seemed to retain any
attachment to the Romish communion; and most of the counsellors appeared even
sanguine in forwarding the progress of the reformation. The riches, which most
of them had acquired from the spoils of the clergy, induced them to widen the
breach between England and Rome; and by establishing a contrariety of
speculative tenets, as well as of discipline and worship, to render a coalition
with the mother church altogether impracticable[n10]. Their rapacity also, the
chief source of their reforming spirit, was excited by the prospect of pillaging
the secular, as they had already done the regular clergy; and they knew, that,
while any share of the old principles remained, or any regard to the
ecclesiastics, they could never hope to succeed in that enterprize.

{#7} ^The^ numerous and burthensome superstitions, with which the Romish church
was loaded, had thrown many of the reformers, by the spirit of opposition, into
an enthusiastic strain of devotion; and all rites, ceremonies, pomp, order, and
exterior observances were zealously proscribed by them, as hindrances to their
spiritual contemplations, and obstructions to their immediate converse with
heaven. Many circumstances concurred to inflame this daring spirit; the novelty
itself of their doctrines, the triumph of making proselytes, the furious
persecutions to which they were exposed, their animosity against the ancient
tenets and practices, and the necessity of procuring the concurrence of the
laity, by depressing the hierarchy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
ecclesiastics. Wherever the reformation prevailed over the opposition of civil
authority, this genius of religion appeared in its full extent, and was attended
with consequences, which, though less durable, were, for some time, not less
dangerous than those which were connected with the ancient superstition. But as
the magistrate took the lead in England, the transition was more gradual; much
of the ancient religion was still preserved; and a reasonable degree of
subordination was retained in discipline, as well as some pomp, order, and
ceremony in public worship.

{#8} ^The^ protector, in his schemes for advancing the reformation, had always
recourse to the counsels of Cranmer, who, being a man of moderation and
prudence, was averse to all violent changes, and |determined to bring over the
people by insensible innovations, to that system of doctrine and discipline,
which he deemed the most pure and perfect. He probably also foresaw, that a
system, which carefully avoided the extremes of reformation, was likely to be
most lasting; and that a devotion, merely spiritual, was fitted only for the
first fervours of a new sect, and upon the relaxation of these naturally gave
place to the inroads of superstition. He seems therefore to have intended the
establishment of a hierarchy, which, being suited to a great and settled
government, might stand as a perpetual barrier against Rome, and might retain
the reverence of the people, even after their enthusiastic zeal was diminished
or entirely evaporated.

{#9} ^The^ person, who opposed, with greatest authority, any farther advances
towards reformation, was Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; who, though he had not
obtained a place in the council of regency, on account of late disgusts, which
he had given to Henry, was entitled, by his age, experience, and capacity, to
the highest trust and confidence of his party. #Gardiner's opposition.# This
prelate still continued to magnify the great wisdom and learning of the late
king, which, indeed, were generally and sincerely revered by the nation; and he
insisted on the prudence of persevering, at least till the young king's
majority, in the ecclesiastical model, established by that great monarch. He
defended the use of images, which were now openly attacked by the protestants;
and he represented them as serviceable in maintaining a sense of religion among
the illiterate multitude[n11]. He even deigned to write an apology for _holy
water,_ which bishop Ridley had decried in a sermon; and he maintained, that, by
the power of the Almighty, it might be rendered an instrument of doing good; as
much as the shadow of St. Peter, the hem of Christ's garment, or the spittle and
clay laid upon the eyes of the blind[n12]. Above all, he insisted, that the laws
ought to be observed, that the constitution ought to be preserved inviolate, and
that it was dangerous to follow the will of the sovereign, in opposition to an
act of parliament[n13].

{#10} ^But^ though there remained at that time in England an idea of laws and a
constitution, sufficient at least to furnish a topic of argument to such as were
discontented with any immediate exercise |of authority; this plea could
scarcely, in the present case, be maintained with any plausibility by Gardiner.
An act of parliament had invested the crown with a legislative power; and royal
proclamations, even during a minority, were armed with the force of laws. The
protector, finding himself supported by this statute, was determined to employ
his authority in favour of the reformers; and having suspended, during the
interval, the jurisdiction of the bishops, he appointed a general visitation to
be made in all the dioceses of England[n14]. The visitors consisted of a mixture
of clergy and laity, and had six circuits assigned them. The chief purport of
their instructions was, besides correcting immoralities and irregularities in
the clergy, to abolish the ancient superstitions, and to bring the discipline
and worship somewhat nearer the practice of the reformed churches. The
moderation of Somerset and Cranmer is apparent in the conduct of this delicate
affair. The visitors were enjoined to retain for the present all images which
had not been abused to idolatry; and to instruct the people not to despise such
ceremonies as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware of some particular
superstitions, such as the sprinkling of their beds with holy water, and the
ringing of bells, or using of consecrated candles, in order to drive away the
devil[n15].

{#11} ^But^ nothing required more the correcting hand of authority, than the
abuse of preaching, which was now generally employed, throughout England, in
defending the ancient practices and superstitions. The court of augmentation, in
order to ease the exchequer of the annuities paid to monks, had commonly placed
them in the vacant churches; and these men were led by interest, as well as by
inclination, to support those principles, which had been invented for the profit
of the clergy. Orders therefore were given to restrain the topics of their
sermons: Twelve homilies were published, which they were enjoined to read to the
people: And all of them were prohibited, without express permission, from
preaching any where but in their parish churches. The purpose of this injunction
was to throw a restraint on the catholic divines; while the protestant, by the
grant of particular licences, should be allowed unbounded liberty.

{#12} ^Bonner^ made some opposition to these measures; but soon |after retracted
and acquiesced. Gardiner was more high spirited and more steady. He represented
the peril of perpetual innovations, and the necessity of adhering to some
system. "'Tis a dangerous thing," said he, "to use too much freedom, in
researches of this kind. If you cut the old canal, the water is apt to run
farther than you have a mind to. If you indulge the humour of novelty, you
cannot put a stop to people's demands, nor govern their indiscretions at
pleasure. For my part," said he, on another occasion, "my sole concern is to
manage the third and last act of my life with decency, and to make a handsome
exit off the stage. Provided this point is secured, I am not solicitous about
the rest. I am already by nature condemned to death: No man can give me a pardon
from this sentence; nor so much as procure me a reprieve. To speak my mind, and
to act as my conscience directs, are two branches of liberty, which I can never
part with. Sincerity in speech, and integrity in action, are entertaining
qualities: They will stick by a man, when every thing else takes its leave; and
I must not resign them upon any consideration. The best on it is, if I do not
throw them away myself, no man can force them from me: But if I give them up,
then am I ruined by myself, and deserve to lose all my preferments."[n16] This
opposition of Gardiner drew on him the indignation of the council; and he was
sent to the Fleet, where he was used with some severity.

{#13} ^One^ of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner against the new homilies,
was that they defined, with the most metaphysical precision, the doctrines of
grace, and of justification by faith; points, he thought, which it was
superfluous for any man to know exactly, and which certainly much exceeded the
comprehension of the vulgar. A famous martyrologist calls Gardiner, on account
of this opinion, "An insensible ass, and one that had no feeling of God's spirit
in the matter of justification."[n17] The meanest protestant imagined at that
time, that he had a full comprehension of all those mysterious doctrines; and he
heartily despised the most learned and knowing person of the ancient religion,
who acknowledged his ignorance with regard to them. It is indeed certain, that
the reformers were very fortunate in their doctrine of justification, and |might
venture to foretel its success, in opposition to all the ceremonies, shows, and
superstitions of popery. By exalting Christ and his sufferings, and renouncing
all claim to independent merit in ourselves, it was calculated to become
popular, and coincided with those principles of panegyric and of self-abasement,
which generally have place in religion.

{#14} ^Tonstal^, bishop of Durham, having, as well as Gardiner, made some
opposition to the new regulations, was dismissed the council; but no farther
severity was, for the present, exercised against him. He was a man of great
moderation, and of the most unexceptionable character in the kingdom.

{#15} #Foreign affairs.# ^The^ same religious zeal, which engaged Somerset to
promote the reformation at home, led him to carry his attention to foreign
countries; where the interests of the protestants were now exposed to the most
imminent danger. The Roman pontiff, with much reluctance and after long delays,
had at last summoned a general council, which was assembled at Trent, and was
employed, both in correcting the abuses of the church, and in ascertaining her
doctrines. The emperor, who desired to repress the power of the court of Rome,
as well as gain over the protestants, promoted the former object of the council;
the pope, who found his own greatness so deeply interested, desired rather to
employ them in the latter. He gave instructions to his legates, who presided in
the council, to protract the debates, and to engage the theologians in argument,
and altercation, and dispute concerning the nice points of faith, canvassed
before them: A policy, so easy to be executed, that the legates soon found it
rather necessary to interpose, in order to appease the animosity of the divines,
and bring them at last to some decision[n18]. The more difficult task for the
legates was to moderate or divert the zeal of the council for reformation, and
to repress the ambition of the prelates, who desired to exalt the episcopal
authority on the ruins of the sovereign pontiff. Finding this humour become
prevalent, the legates, on pretence that the plague had broken out at Trent,
transferred of a sudden the council to Bologna, where, they hoped, it would be
more under the direction of his holiness.

{#16} ^The^ emperor, no less than the pope, had learned to make |religion
subservient to his ambition and policy. He was resolved to employ the imputation
of heresy as a pretence for subduing the protestant princes, and oppressing the
liberties of Germany; but found it necessary to cover his intentions under deep
artifice, and to prevent the combination of his adversaries. He separated the
Palatine and the elector of Brandenburgh from the protestant confederacy: He
took arms against the elector of Saxony, and the landgrave of Hesse: By the
fortune of war, he made the former prisoner: He employed treachery and
prevarication against the latter, and detained him captive, by breaking a
safe-conduct which he had granted him. He seemed to have reached the summit of
his ambition; and the German princes, who were astonished with his success, were
farther discouraged by the intelligence, which they had received, of the death,
first of Henry VIII. then of Francis I. their usual resources in every
calamity[n19].

{#17} ^Henry^ II. who succeeded to the crown of France, was a prince of vigour
and abilities; but less hasty in his resolutions than Francis, and less enflamed
with rivalship and animosity against the emperor Charles. Though he sent
ambassadors to the princes of the Smalcaldic League, and promised them
protection, he was unwilling, in the commencement of his reign, to hurry into a
war with so great a power as that of the emperor; and he thought that the
alliance of those princes was a sure resource, which he could at any time lay
hold of[n20]. He was much governed by the duke of Guise and the cardinal of
Lorraine; and he hearkened to their counsel, in chusing rather to give immediate
assistance to Scotland, his ancient ally, which, even before the death of Henry
VIII. had loudly claimed the protection of the French monarchy.

{#18} #Progress of the reformation in Scotland.# ^The^ hatred between the two
factions, the partizans of the ancient and those of the new religion, became
every day more violent in Scotland; and the resolution, which the cardinal
primate had taken, to employ the most rigorous punishments against the
reformers, brought matters to a quick decision. There was one Wishart, a
gentleman by birth, who employed himself with great zeal in preaching against
the ancient superstitions, and began to give alarm to the clergy, who were
justly terrified with the danger of some fatal revolution in religion. This man
was celebrated for the |purity of his morals, and for his extensive learning:
But these praises cannot be much depended on; because, we know, that, among the
reformers, severity of manners supplied the place of many virtues; and the age
was in general so ignorant, that most of the priests in Scotland imagined the
New Testament to be a composition of Luther's, and asserted that the Old alone
was the word of God[n21]. But however the case may have stood with regard to
those estimable qualities ascribed to Wishart, he was strongly possessed with
the desire of innovation; and he enjoyed those talents, which qualified him for
becoming a popular preacher, and for seizing the attention and affections of the
multitude. The magistrates of Dundee, where he exercised his mission, were
alarmed with his progress; and being unable or unwilling to treat him with
rigour, they contented themselves with denying him the liberty of preaching, and
with dismissing him the bounds of their jurisdiction. Wishart, moved with
indignation, that they had dared to reject him, together with the word of God,
menaced them, in imitation of the ancient prophets, with some imminent calamity;
and he withdrew to the west country, where he daily encreased the number of his
proselytes. Meanwhile, a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed, that
the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven by banishing the pious preacher,
and that the pestilence would never cease, till they had made him atonement for
their offence against him. No sooner did Wishart hear of this change in their
disposition, than he returned to them, and made them a new tender of his
doctrine: But lest he should spread the contagion by bringing multitudes
together, he erected his pulpit on the top of a gate: The infected stood within;
the others without. And the preacher failed not, in such a situation, to take
advantage of the immediate terrors of the people, and to enforce his evangelical
mission[n22].

{#19} ^The^ assiduity and success of Wishart became an object of attention to
cardinal Beaton; and he resolved, by the punishment of so celebrated a preacher,
to strike a terror into all other innovators. He engaged the earl of Bothwel to
arrest him; and to deliver him into his hands, contrary to a promise given by
Bothwel to that |unhappy man: And being possessed of his prey, he conducted him
to St. Andrew's, where, after a trial, he condemned him to the flames for
heresy. Arran, the governor, was irresolute in his temper; and the cardinal,
though he had gained him over to his party, found, that he would not concur in
the condemnation and execution of Wishart. He determined, therefore, without the
assistance of the secular arm, to bring that heretic to punishment; and he
himself beheld from his window the dismal spectacle. Wishart suffered with the
usual patience; but could not forbear remarking the triumph of his insulting
enemy. He foretold, that, in a few days, he should, in the very same place, lie
as low, as now he was exalted aloft, in opposition to true piety and
religion[n23].

{#20} #Assassination of cardinal Beaton.# ^This^ prophecy was probably the
immediate cause of the event which it foretold. The disciples of this martyr,
enraged at the cruel execution, formed a conspiracy against the cardinal; and
having associated to them Norman Lesly, who was disgusted on account of some
private quarrel, they conducted their enterprize with great secrecy and success.
Early in the morning they entered the cardinal's palace, which he had strongly
fortified; and though they were not above sixteen persons, they thrust out a
hundred tradesmen and fifty servants, whom they seized separately, before any
suspicion arose of their intentions; and having shut the gates, they proceeded
very deliberately to execute their purpose on the cardinal. That prelate had
been alarmed with the noise which he heard in the castle; and had barricaded the
door of his chamber: But finding that they had brought fire in order to force
their way, and having obtained, as is believed, a promise of life, he opened the
door; and reminding them, that he was a priest, he conjured them to spare him.
Two of the assassins rushed upon him with drawn swords; but a third, James
Melvil, more calm and more considerate in villany, stopped their career, and
bade them reflect, that this sacrifice was the work and judgment of God, and
ought to be executed with becoming deliberation and gravity. Then turning the
point of his sword towards Beaton, he called to him, "Repent thee, thou wicked
cardinal, of all thy sins and iniquities, especially of the murder of Wishart,
that instrument of God for the |conversion of these lands: It is his death,
which now cries vengeance upon thee: We are sent by God to inflict the deserved
punishment. For here, before the Almighty, I protest, that it is neither hatred
of thy person, nor love of thy riches, nor fear of thy power, which moves me to
seek thy death: But only because thou hast been, and still remainest, an
obstinate enemy to Christ Jesus, and his holy gospel." Having spoken these
words, without giving Beaton time to finish that repentance, to which he
exhorted him, he thrust him through the body; and the cardinal fell dead at his
feet[n24]. This murder was executed on the 28th of May 1546. The assassins,
being reinforced by their friends to the number of a hundred and forty persons,
prepared themselves for the defence of the castle, and sent a messenger to
London, craving assistance from Henry. That prince, though Scotland was
comprehended in his peace with France, would not forego the opportunity of
disturbing the government of a rival-kingdom; and he promised to take them under
his protection.

{#21} ^It^ was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five short reigns had
been successively followed by as many long minorities; and the execution of
justice, which the prince was beginning to introduce, had been continually
interrupted by the cabals, factions, and animosities of the great. But besides
these inveterate and ancient evils, a new source of disorder had arisen, the
disputes and contentions of theology, which were sufficient to disturb the most
settled government; and the death of the cardinal, who was possessed of
abilities and vigour, seemed much to weaken the hands of the administration. But
the queen-dowager was a woman of uncommon talents and virtue; and she did as
much to support the government, and supply the weakness of Arran, the governor,
as could be expected in her situation.

{#22} #Conduct of the war with Scotland.# ^The^ protector of England, as soon as
the state was brought to some composure, made preparations for war with
Scotland; and he was determined to execute, if possible, that project, of
uniting the two kingdoms by marriage, on which the late king had been so intent,
and which he had recommended with his dying breath to his executors. He levied
an army of 18,000 men, and equipped a fleet of sixty sail, one half of which
were ships of war, the other laden with provisions and ammunition. He gave the
command of the fleet to lord Clinton: He himself marched at the head of the
army, attended by the earl of Warwic. These hostile measures were covered with a
pretence of revenging some depredations committed by the borderers; but besides,
that Somerset revived the ancient claim of the superiority of the English crown
over that of Scotland, he refused to enter into negociation on any other
condition than the marriage of the young queen with Edward.

{#23} ^The^ protector, before he opened the campaign, published a manifesto, in
which he enforced all the arguments for that measure. He said, that nature
seemed originally to have intended this island for one empire; and having cut it
off from all communication with foreign states, and guarded it by the ocean, she
had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to happiness and to security: That
the education and customs of the people concurred with nature; and by giving
them the same language, and laws, and manners, had invited them to a thorough
union and coalition: That fortune had at last removed all obstacles, and had
prepared an expedient, by which they might become one people, without leaving
any place for that jealousy either of honour or of interest, to which rival
nations are naturally exposed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved on a
female: that of England on a male; and happily the two sovereigns, as of a rank,
were also of an age, the most suitable to each other: That the hostile
dispositions, which prevailed between the nations, and which arose from past
injuries, would soon be extinguished, after a long and secure peace had
established confidence between them: That the memory of former miseries, which
at present inflamed their mutual animosity, would then serve only to make them
cherish, with more passion, a state of happiness and tranquillity, so long
unknown to their ancestors: That when hostilities had ceased between the
kingdoms, the Scottish nobility, who were at present obliged to remain
perpetually in |a warlike posture, would learn to cultivate the arts of peace,
and would soften their minds to a love of domestic order and obedience: That as
this situation was desirable to both kingdoms, so particularly to Scotland,
which had been exposed to the greatest miseries from intestine and foreign wars,
and saw herself every moment in danger of losing her independancy, by the
efforts of a richer, and more powerful people: That though England had claims of
superiority, she was willing to resign every pretension for the sake of future
peace, and desired an union, which would be the more secure, as it would be
concluded on terms entirely equal: And that, besides all these motives, positive
engagements had been taken for completing this alliance; and the honour and good
faith of the nation were pledged to fulfil what her interest and safety so
loudly demanded[n25].

{#24} ^Somerset^ soon perceived, that these remonstrances would have no
influence; and that the queen dowager's attachment to France and to the catholic
religion would render ineffectual all negociations for the intended marriage. He
found himself, therefore, obliged to try the force of arms, and to constrain the
Scots by necessity to submit to a measure, for which they seemed to have
entertained the most incurable aversion. #2d Sept.# He passed the borders at
Berwic, and advanced towards Edinburgh, without meeting any resistance for some
days, except from some small castles, which he obliged to surrender at
discretion. The protector intended to have punished the governor and garrison of
one of these castles for their temerity in resisting such unequal force: But
they eluded his anger by asking only a few hours' respite, till they should
prepare themselves for death; after which they found his ears more open to their
applications for mercy[n26].

{#25} ^The^ governor of Scotland had summoned together the whole force of the
kingdom; and his army, double in number to that of the English, had taken post
on advantageous ground, guarded by the banks of the Eske, about four miles from
Edinburgh. The English came within sight of them at Faside; and after a skirmish
between the horse, where the Scots were worsted, and lord Hume dangerously
wounded, Somerset prepared himself for a more |decisive action. But having taken
a view of the Scotish camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult to
make an attempt upon it with any probability of success. He wrote, therefore,
another letter to Arran; and offered to evacuate the kingdom, as well as to
repair all the damages which he had committed, provided the Scots would
stipulate not to contract the queen to any foreign prince, but to detain her at
home, till she reached the age of chusing a husband for herself. So moderate a
demand was rejected by the Scots merely on account of its moderation; and it
made them imagine that the protector must either be reduced to great distress or
be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to abate so much of his former
pretensions. Inflamed also by their priests, who had come to the camp in great
numbers, they believed, that the English were detestable heretics, abhorred of
God, and exposed to divine vengeance; and that no success could ever crown their
arms. They were confirmed in this fond conceit, when they saw the protector
change his ground, and move towards the sea; nor did they any longer doubt, that
he intended to embark his army, and make his escape on board the ships, which at
that very time moved into the bay, opposite to him[n27]. Determined therefore to
cut off his retreat, they quitted their camp: and passing the river Eske,
advanced into the plain. They were divided into three bodies: #10th Sept.# Angus
commanded the vanguard; Arran the main body; Huntley the rear: Their cavalry
consisted only of light horse, which were placed on their left flank,
strengthened by some Irish archers, whom Argyle had brought over for this
service.

{#26} ^Somerset^ was much pleased when he saw this movement of the Scottish
army; and as the English had usually been superior in pitched battles, he
conceived great hopes of success. He ranged his van on the left, farthest from
the sea; and ordered them to remain on the high grounds on which he placed them,
till the enemy should approach: #The battle of Pinkey.# He placed his main
battle and his rear towards the right; and beyond the van he posted lord Grey at
the head of the men at arms, and ordered him to take the Scottish van in flank,
but not till they should be engaged in close fight with the van of the English.

{#27} ^While^ the Scots were advancing on the plain, they were galled |with the
artillery from the English ships: The eldest son of lord Graham was killed: The
Irish archers were thrown into disorder; and even the other troops began to
stagger: When lord Grey, perceiving their situation, neglected his orders, left
his ground, and at the head of his heavy-armed horse made an attack on the
Scottish infantry, in hopes of gaining all the honour of the victory. On
advancing, he found a slough and ditch in his way; and behind were ranged the
enemy armed with spears, and the field, on which they stood, was fallow ground,
broken with ridges, which lay across their front, and disordered the movements
of the English cavalry. From all these accidents, the shock of this body of
horse was feeble and irregular; and as they were received on the points of the
Scottish spears, which were longer than the lances of the English horsemen, they
were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and discomfited. Grey himself was
dangerously wounded: Lord Edward Seymour, son of the protector, had his horse
killed under him: The standard was near being taken: And had the Scots possessed
any good body of cavalry, who could have pursued the advantage, the whole
English army had been exposed to great danger[n28].

{#28} ^The^ protector mean-while, assisted by Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir Ralph
Vane, employed himself with diligence and success, in rallying the cavalry.
Warwic showed great presence of mind in maintaining the ranks of the foot, on
which the horse had recoiled: He made Sir Peter Meutas advance, captain of the
foot harquebusiers, and Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of some Italian and Spanish
harquebusiers on horseback; and ordered them to ply the Scottish infantry with
their shot. They marched to the slough, and discharged their pieces full in the
face of the enemy: The ships galled them from the flank: The artillery, planted
on a height, infested them from the front: The English archers poured in a
shower of arrows upon them: And the vanguard, descending from the hill,
advanced, leisurely and in good order, towards them. Dismayed with all these
circumstances, the Scottish van began to retreat: The retreat soon changed into
a flight, which was begun by the Irish archers. The pannic of the van
communicated itself to the main body, and passing thence to the rear, rendered
the whole field a scene of confusion, terror, flight, and consternation. The
English |army perceived from the heights the condition of the Scots, and began
the pursuit with loud shouts and acclamations, which added still more to the
dismay of the vanquished. The horse in particular, eager to revenge the affront,
which they had received in the beginning of the day, did the most bloody
execution on the flying enemy; and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for
the space of five miles, the whole ground was strowed with dead bodies. The
priests above all, and the monks received no quarter; and the English made sport
of slaughtering men, who, from their extreme zeal and animosity, had engaged in
an enterprise so ill befitting their profession. Few victories have been more
decisive, or gained with smaller loss to the conquerors. There fell not two
hundred of the English; and according to the most moderate computation, there
perished above ten thousand of the Scots. About fifteen hundred were taken
prisoners. This action was called the battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's seat
of that name in the neighbourhood.

{#29} ^The^ queen-dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and were scarcely able to
collect such a body of forces as could check the incursions of small parties of
the English. About the same time, the earl of Lenox and lord Wharton entered the
West Marches, at the head of five thousand men, and after taking and plundering
Annan, they spread devastation over all the neighbouring counties[n29]. Had
Somerset prosecuted his advantages, he might have imposed what terms he pleased
on the Scottish nation: But he was impatient to return to England, where, he
heard, some counsellors, and even his own brother, the admiral, were carrying on
cabals against his authority. Having taken the castles of Hume, Dunglass,
Eymouth, Fastcastle, Roxborough, and some other small places: and having
received the submission of some counties on the borders, he retired from
Scotland. The fleet, besides destroying all the shipping along the coast, took
Broughty in the Frith of Tay; and having fortified it, they there left a
garrison. Arran desired leave to send commissioners in order to treat of a
peace; and Somerset, having appointed Berwic for the place of conference, left
Warwic with full powers to negociate: But no commissioners from Scotland ever
appeared. The overture of the Scots was an artifice, to gain time, till succours
should arrive from France.

{#30} #4th Nov.# ^The^ protector, on his arrival in England, summoned a
parliament: And being somewhat elated with his success against the Scots, he
procured from his nephew a patent, appointing him to sit on the throne, upon a
stool or bench at the right hand of the king, and to enjoy the same honours and
privileges, that had usually been possessed by any prince of the blood, or uncle
of the kings of England. In this patent, the king employed his dispensing power,
by setting aside the statute of precedency, enacted during the former
reign[n30]. #A parliament.# But if Somerset gave offence by assuming too much
state, he deserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session, by
which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated, and some security given
to the freedom of the constitution. All laws were repealed, which extended the
crime of treason beyond the statute of the twenty-fifth of Edward III.[n31]; all
laws enacted during the late reign, extending the crime of felony; all the
former laws against Lollardy or heresy, together with the statute of the six
articles. None were to be accused for words, but within a month after they were
spoken. By these repeals several of the most rigorous laws, that ever had passed
in England, were annulled: and some dawn, both of civil and religious liberty,
began to appear to the people. Heresy, however, was still a capital crime by the
common law, and was subjected to the penalty of burning. Only, there remained no
precise standard, by which that crime could be defined or determined: A
circumstance, which might either be advantageous or hurtful to public security,
according to the disposition of the judges.

{#31} ^A^ repeal also passed of that law, the destruction of all laws, by which
the king's proclamation was made of equal force with a statute[n32]. That other
law likewise was mitigated, by which the king was empowered to annul every
statute passed before the four and twentieth year of his age: He could prevent
their future execution; but could not recal any past effects, which had ensued
from them[n33].

{#32} ^It^ was also enacted, that all who denied the king's supremacy, or
asserted the pope's, should, for the first offence, forfeit their goods and
chattels, and suffer imprisonment during pleasure; for the second offence,
should incur the penalty of a _praemunire;_ and for the third be attainted of
treason. But if any, after the first of March ensuing, endeavoured, by writing,
printing, or any overt act |or deed, to deprive the king of his estate or
titles, particularly of his supremacy, or to confer them on any other, he was to
be adjudged guilty of treason. If any of the heirs of the crown should usurp
upon another, or endeavour to break the order of succession, it was declared
treason in them, their aiders and abettors. These were the most considerable
acts passed during this session. The members in general discovered a very
passive disposition with regard to religion: Some few appeared zealous for the
reformation: Others secretly harboured a strong propensity to the catholic
faith: But the greater part appeared willing to take any impression, which they
should receive from interest, authority, or the reigning fashion[n34].

{#33} ^The^ convocation met at the same time with the parliament; and as it was
found, that their debates were at first cramped by the rigorous statute of the
six articles, the king granted them a dispensation from that law, before it was
repealed by parliament[n35]. The lower house of convocation applied to have
liberty of sitting with the commons in parliament; or if this privilege were
refused them, which they claimed as their ancient right, they desired, that no
law, regarding religion, might pass in parliament without their consent and
approbation. But the principles, which now prevailed, were more favourable to
the civil than to the ecclesiastical power; and this demand of the convocation
was rejected.

{#34} #1548.# ^The^ protector had assented to the repeal of that law, which gave
to the king's proclamations the authority of statutes; but he did not intend to
renounce that arbitrary or discretionary exercise of power, in issuing
proclamations, which had ever been assumed by the crown, and which it is
difficult to distinguish exactly from a full legislative power. #Farther
progress of the reformation.# He even continued to exert this authority in some
particulars, which were then regarded as the most momentous. Orders were issued
by council, that candles should no longer be carried about on Candlemas day,
ashes on Ash-wednesday, palms on Palm-sunday[n36]. These were ancient religious
practices, now termed superstitions: though it is fortunate for mankind, when
superstition happens to take a direction so innocent and inoffensive. The severe
disposition, which naturally |attends all reformers, prompted likewise the
council to abolish some gay and showy ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient
religion[n37].

{#35} ^An^ order was also issued by council for the removal of all images from
the churches: An innovation which was much desired by the reformers, and which
alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almost to a total change of the
established religion[n38]. An attempt had been made to separate the use of
images from their abuse, the reverence from the worship of them; but the
execution of this design was found, upon trial, very difficult, if not wholly
impracticable.

{#36} ^As^ private masses were abolished by law, it became necessary to compose
a new communion-service; and the council went so far, in the preface which they
prefixed to this work, as to leave the practice of auricular confession wholly
indifferent[n39]. This was a prelude to the entire abolition of that invention,
one of the most powerful engines that ever was contrived for degrading the
laity, and giving their spiritual guides an entire ascendant over them. And it
may justly be said, that, though the priest's absolution, which attends
confession, serves somewhat to ease weak minds from the immediate agonies of
superstitious terror, it operates only by enforcing superstition itself, and
thereby preparing the mind for a more violent relapse into the same disorders.

{#37} ^The^ people were at that time extremely distracted, by the opposite
opinions of their preachers; and as they were totally unable to judge of the
reasons advanced on either side, and naturally regarded every thing which they
heard at church, as of equal authority, a great confusion and fluctuation
resulted from this uncertainty. The council had first endeavoured to remedy the
inconvenience, by laying some restraints on preaching; but finding this
expedient ineffectual, they imposed a total silence on the preachers, and
thereby put an end at once to all the polemics of the pulpit[n40]. By the nature
of things, this restraint could only be temporary. For in proportion as the
ceremonies of public worship, its shews and exterior observances, were
retrenched by the reformers, the people were inclined to contract a stronger
attachment to |sermons, whence alone they received any occupation or amusement.
The ancient religion, by giving its votaries something to do, freed them from
the trouble of thinking: Sermons were delivered only in the principal churches,
and at some particular fasts and festivals: And the practice of haranguing the
populace, which, if abused, is so powerful an incitement to faction and
sedition, had much less scope and influence during those ages.

{#38} #Affairs of Scotland.# ^The^ greater progress was made towards a
reformation in England, the farther did the protector find himself from all
prospect of completing the union with Scotland; and the queen-dowager, as well
as the clergy, became the more averse to all alliance with a nation, which had
so far departed from all ancient principles. Somerset, having taken the town of
Haddington, had ordered it to be strongly garrisoned and fortified, by lord
Grey: He also erected some fortifications at Lauder: And he hoped, that these
two places, together with Broughty and some smaller fortresses, which were in
the hands of the English, would serve as a curb on Scotland; and would give him
access into the heart of the country.

{#39} ^Arran^, being disappointed in some attempts on Broughty, relied chiefly
on the succours expected from France, for the recovery of these places; and they
arrived at last in the Frith, to the number of six thousand men; half of them
Germans. They were commanded by Desse, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi,
Meilleraye, and count Rhingrave. The Scots were at that time so sunk by their
misfortunes, that five hundred English horse were able to ravage the whole
country without resistance; and make inroads to the gates of the capital[n41]:
But on the appearance of the French succours, they collected more courage; and
having joined Desse with a considerable reinforcement, they laid siege to
Haddington[n42]. This was an undertaking for which they were by themselves
totally unfit; and even with the assistance of the French, they placed their
chief hopes of success in starving the garrison. After some vain attempts to
take the place by a regular siege, the blockade was formed, and the garrison was
repulsed with loss in several sallies which they made upon the besiegers.

{#40} ^The^ hostile attempts, which the late king and the protector had |made
against Scotland, not being steady, regular, nor pushed to the last extremity,
had served only to irritate the nation, and to inspire them with the strongest
aversion to that union, which was courted in so violent a manner. Even those who
were inclined to the English alliance, were displeased to have it imposed on
them by force of arms; and the earl of Huntley in particular, said pleasantly,
that he disliked not the match, but he hated the manner of wooing[n43]. The
queen-dowager, finding these sentiments to prevail, called a parliament, in an
abbey near Haddington; and it was there proposed, that the young queen, for her
greater security, should be sent to France, and be committed to the custody of
that ancient ally. Some objected, that this measure was desperate, allowed no
resource in case of miscarriage, exposed the Scots to be subjected by
foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with England, and left them no
expedient, by which they could conciliate the friendship of that powerful
nation. It was answered, on the other hand, that the queen's presence was the
very cause of war with England; that that nation would desist, when they found,
that their views of forcing a marriage had become altogether impracticable; and
that Henry, being engaged by so high a mark of confidence, would take their
sovereign under his protection, and use his utmost efforts to defend the
kingdom. These arguments were aided by French gold, which was plentifully
distributed among the nobles. The governor had a pension conferred on him of
twelve thousand livres a year, received the title of duke of Chatelrault, and
obtained for his son the command of a hundred men at arms[n44]. And as the
clergy dreaded the consequences of the English alliance, they seconded this
measure with all the zeal and industry, which either principle or interest could
inspire. #Young queen of Scots sent into France.# It was accordingly determined
to send the queen to France; and what was understood to be the necessary
consequence, to marry her to the dauphin. Villegaignon, commander of four French
gallies lying in the Frith of Forth, set sail as if he intended to return home;
but when he reached the open sea, he turned northwards, passed by the Orkneys,
and came in on the west coast at Dunbarton: An extraordinary voyage for ships of
that fabric[n45]. The young queen was there committed to him; and |being
attended by the lords Ereskine and Livingstone, she put to sea, and after
meeting with some tempestuous weather, arrived safely at Brest, whence she was
conducted to Paris, and soon after she was betrothed to the dauphin.

{#41} ^Somerset^, pressed by many difficulties at home, and despairing of
success in his enterprize against Scotland, was desirous of composing the
differences with that kingdom, and he offered the Scots a ten years' truce; but
as they insisted on his restoring all the places which he had taken, the
proposal came to nothing. The Scots recovered the fortresses of Hume and
Fast-castle by surprize, and put the garrisons to the sword: They repulsed, with
loss, the English, who, under the command of lord Seymour, made a descent, first
in Fife, then at Montrose: In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother
to the queen, acquired honour; on the latter, Areskine of Dun. An attempt was
made by Sir Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a considerable
body, to throw relief into Haddington; but these troops, falling into an
ambuscade, were almost wholly cut in pieces[n46]. And though a small body of two
hundred men escaped all the vigilance of the French, and arrived safely in
Haddington, with some ammunition and provisions, the garrison was reduced to
such difficulties, that the protector found it necessary to provide more
effectually for their relief. He raised an army of eighteen thousand men, and
adding three thousand Germans, who, on the dissolution of the protestant
alliance, had offered their service to England, he gave the command of the whole
to the earl of Shrewsbury[n47]. D'Essé raised the blockade on the approach of
the English; and with great difficulty made good his retreat to Edinburgh, where
he posted himself advantageously. Shrewsbury, who had lost the opportunity of
attacking him on his march, durst not give him battle in his present situation;
and contenting himself with the advantage already gained, of supplying
Haddington, he retired into England.

{#42} ^Though^ the protection of France was of great consequence to the Scots,
in supporting them against the invasions of England, they reaped still more
benefit from the distractions and divisions, #Cabals of lord Seymour.# which had
creeped into the councils of this latter kingdom. Even the two brothers, the
protector and admiral, not content with the |high stations which they severally
enjoyed, and the great eminence to which they had risen, had entertained the
most violent jealousy of each other; and they divided the whole court and
kingdom, by their opposite cabals and pretensions. Lord Seymour was a man of
insatiable ambition; arrogant, assuming, implacable; and though esteemed of
superior capacity to the protector, he possessed not to the same degree the
confidence and regard of the people. By his flattery and address, he had so
insinuated himself into the good graces of the queen-dowager, that, forgetting
her usual prudence and decency, she married him immediately upon the demise of
the late king: Insomuch that, had she soon proved pregnant, it might have been
doubtful to which husband the child belonged. The credit and riches of this
alliance supported the ambition of the admiral; but gave umbrage to the dutchess
of Somerset, who, uneasy that the younger brother's wife should have the
precedency, employed all her credit with her husband, which was too great, first
to create, then to widen, the breach between the two brothers[n48].

{#43} ^The^ first symptoms of this misunderstanding appeared when the protector
commanded the army in Scotland. Secretary Paget, a man devoted to Somerset,
remarked, that Seymour was forming separate intrigues among the counsellors; was
corrupting, by presents, the king's servants; and even endeavouring, by improper
indulgences and liberalities, to captiviate the affections of the young monarch.
Paget represented to him the danger of this conduct; desired him to reflect on
the numerous enemies, whom the sudden elevation of their family had created; and
warned him that any dissention between him and the protector would be greedily
laid hold of, to effect the ruin of both. Finding his remonstrances neglected,
he conveyed intelligence of the danger to Somerset, and engaged him to leave the
enterprize upon Scotland unfinished, in order to guard against the attempts of
his domestic enemies. In the ensuing parliament, the admiral's projects appeared
still more dangerous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired many
partizans, he made a direct attack upon his brother's authority. He represented
to his friends, that formerly, during a minority, the |office of protector of
the kingdom had been kept separate from that of governor of the king's person;
and that the present union of these two important trusts conferred on Somerset
an authority, which could not safely be lodged in any subject[n49]. The young
king was even prevailed on to write a letter to the parliament, desiring that
Seymour might be appointed his governor; and that nobleman had formed a party in
the two houses, by which he hoped to effect his purpose. The design was
discovered before its execution; and some common friends were sent to
remonstrate with him, but had so little influence, that he threw out many
menacing expressions, and rashly threatened, that, if he were thwarted in his
attempt, he would make this parliament the blackest that ever sat in
England[n50]. The council sent for him, to answer for his conduct; but he
refused to attend: They then began to threaten in their turn, and informed him,
that the king's letter, instead of availing him any thing to the execution of
his views, would be imputed to him as a criminal enterprize, and be construed as
a design to disturb the government, by forming a separate interest with a child
and minor. They even let fall some menaces of sending him to the Tower for his
temerity; and the admiral, finding himself prevented in his design, was obliged
to submit, and to desire a reconciliation with his brother.

{#44} ^The^ mild and moderate temper of Somerset made him willing to forget
these enterprizes of the admiral; but the ambition of that turbulent spirit
could not be so easily appeased. His spouse, the queen-dowager, died in
childbed; but so far from regarding this event as a check to his aspiring views,
he founded on it the scheme of a more extraordinary elevation. He made his
addresses to the lady Elizabeth, then in the sixteenth year of her age; and that
princess, whom even the hurry of business, and the pursuits of ambition, could
not, in her more advanced years, disengage entirely from the tender passions,
seems to have listened to the insinuations of a man, who possessed every talent
proper to captivate the affections of the fair[n51]. But as Henry VIII. had
excluded his daughters from all hopes of succession, if they married without the
consent of his executors, which Seymour could never hope to obtain; it was
concluded that he meant to effect his purpose by |expedients still more rash and
more criminal. All the other measures of the admiral tended to confirm this
suspicion. He continued to attack, by presents, the fidelity of those who had
more immediate access to the king's person: He endeavoured to seduce the young
prince into his interests: He found means of holding a private correspondence
with him: He openly decried his brother's administration; and asserted, that, by
enlisting Germans, and other foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army,
which might endanger the king's authority, and the liberty of the people: By
promises and persuasion he brought over to his party many of the principal
nobility; and had extended his interest all over England: He neglected not even
the most popular persons of inferior rank; and had computed, that he could, on
occasion, muster an army of 10,000 men, composed of his servants, tenants, and
retainers[n52]: He had already provided arms for their use; and having engaged
in his interests Sir John Sharington, a corrupt man, master of the mint at
Bristol, he flattered himself that money would not be wanting. Somerset was well
apprized of all these alarming circumstances, and endeavoured, by the most
friendly expedients, by intreaty, reason, and even by heaping new favours upon
the admiral, to make him desist from his dangerous counsels: But finding all
endeavours ineffectual, he began to think of more severe remedies. The earl of
Warwic was an ill instrument between the brothers; and had formed the design, by
inflaming the quarrel, to raise his own fortune on the ruins of both.

{#45} #Dudley, earl of Warwic.# ^Dudley^, earl of Warwic, was the son of that
Dudley, minister to Henry VII. who, having, by rapine, extortion, and perversion
of law, incurred the hatred of the public, had been sacrificed to popular
animosity, in the beginning of the subsequent reign. The late king, sensible of
the iniquity, at least illegality, of the sentence, had afterwards restored
young Dudley's blood by act of parliament; and finding him endowed with
abilities, industry, and activity, he had entrusted him with many important
commands, and had ever found him successful in his undertakings. He raised him
to the dignity of viscount Lisle, conferred on him the office of admiral, and
gave him by his will a place among his executors. Dudley made still farther
progress during the minority; and having obtained the |title of earl of Warwic,
and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore the chief rank among the
protector's counsellors. The victory, gained at Pinkey, was much ascribed to his
courage and conduct; and he was universally regarded as a man equally endowed
with the talents of peace and of war. But all these virtues were obscured by
still greater vices; and exorbitant ambition, an insatiable avarice, a neglect
of decency, a contempt of justice: And as he found, that lord Seymour, whose
abilities and enterprizing spirit he chiefly dreaded, was involving himself in
ruin by his rash counsels, he was determined to push him on the precipice; and
thereby remove the chief obstacle to his own projected greatness.

{#46} ^When^ Somerset found, that the public peace was endangered by his
brother's seditious, not to say rebellious, schemes, he was the more easily
persuaded by Warwic to employ the extent of royal authority against him; and
after depriving him of the office of admiral, he signed a warrant for committing
him to the Tower. Some of his accomplices were also taken into custody, and
three privy counsellors, being sent to examine them, made a report, that they
had met with very full and important discoveries. Yet still the protector
suspended the blow, and showed a reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to
desist from the prosecution, if Seymour would promise him a cordial
reconciliation; and renouncing all ambitious hopes, be contented with a private
life, and retire into the country. But as Seymour made no other answer to these
friendly offers than menaces and defiances, he ordered a charge to be drawn up
against him, consisting of thirty-three articles[n53]; and the whole to be laid
before the privy council. It is pretended, that every particular was so
incontestibly proved, both by witnesses and his own hand-writing, that there was
no room for doubt; yet did the council think proper to go in a body to the
Tower, in order more fully to examine the prisoner. He was not daunted by the
appearance: He boldly demanded a fair trial: required to be confronted by the
witnesses; desired that the charge might be left with him, in order to be
considered; and refused to answer any interrogatories, by which he might accuse
himself.

{#47} ^It^ is apparent, that, notwithstanding what is pretended, there must have
been some deficiency in the evidence against Seymour, |when such demands,
founded on the plainest principles of law and equity, were absolutely rejected.
We shall indeed conclude, if we carefully examine the charge, that many of the
articles were general, and scarcely capable of any proof; many of them, if true,
susceptible of a more favourable interpretation; and that, though, on the whole,
Seymour appears to have been a dangerous subject, he had not advanced far in
those treasonable projects imputed to him. The chief part of his actual guilt
seems to have consisted in some unwarrantable practices in the admiralty, by
which pyrates were protected, and illegal impositions laid upon the merchants.

{#48} ^But^ the administration had, at that time, an easy instrument of
vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and needed not to give themselves any concern
with regard either to the guilt of the persons whom they prosecuted, or the
evidence which could be produced against them. A session of parliament being
held, #A parliament. 4th Novem.# it was resolved to proceed against Seymour by
bill of attainder; and the young king being induced, after much solicitation, to
give his consent to it, a considerable weight was put on his approbation. The
matter was first laid before the upper-house; and several peers, rising up in
their places, gave an account of what they knew concerning lord Seymour's
conduct and his criminal words or actions. #1549. Attainder of lord Seymour.#
These narratives were received as undoubted evidence; and though the prisoner
had formerly engaged many friends and partizans among the nobility, no one had
either the courage or equity to move, that he might be heard in his defence,
that the testimony against him should be delivered in a legal manner, and that
he should be confronted with the witnesses. A little more scruple was made in
the house of commons: There were even some members who objected against the
whole method of proceeding by bill of attainder, passed in absence; and
insisted, that a formal trial should be given to every man before his
condemnation. #March 20.# But when a message was sent by the king, enjoining the
house to proceed, and offering that the same narratives should be laid before
them which had satisfied the peers, they were easily prevailed on to
acquiesce[n54]. The bill passed in a full house. Near four hundred voted for it;
not above nine or ten against it[n55]. #His execution.# The sentence was soon
after executed, and the prisoner was beheaded on Tower-hill. The warrant |was
signed by Somerset, who was exposed to much blame, on account of the violence of
these proceedings. The attempts of the admiral seem chiefly to have been
levelled against his brother's usurped authority; and though his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with the lady Elizabeth, might
have endangered the public tranquillity, the prudence of foreseeing evils at
such a distance, was deemed too great; and the remedy was plainly illegal. It
could only be said, that this bill of attainder was somewhat more tolerable than
the preceding ones, to which the nation had been enured. For here, at least,
some shadow of evidence was produced.

{#49} #Ecclesiastical affairs.# ^All^ the considerable business transacted this
session besides the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded ecclesiastical affairs;
which were now the chief object of attention throughout the nation. A committee
of bishops and divines had been appointed by the council, to compose a liturgy;
and they had executed the work committed to them. They proceeded with moderation
in this delicate undertaking: They retained as much of the ancient mass as the
principles of the reformers would permit: They indulged nothing to the spirit of
contradiction, which so naturally takes place in all great innovations: And they
flattered themselves, that they had established a service, in which every
denomination of Christians might, without scruple, concur. The mass had always
been celebrated in Latin; a practice which might have been deemed absurd, had it
not been found useful to the clergy, by impressing the people with an idea of
some mysterious unknown virtue in those rites, and by checking all their
pretensions to be familiarly acquainted with their religion. But as the
reformers pretended, in some few particulars, to encourage private judgment in
the laity, the translation of the liturgy, as well as of the Scriptures, into
the vulgar tongue, seemed more conformable to the genius of their sect; and this
innovation, with the retrenching of prayers to saints, and of some superstitious
ceremonies, was the chief difference between the old mass and the new liturgy.
The parliament established this form of worship in all the churches, and
ordained a uniformity to be observed in all the rites and ceremonies[n56].

{#50} ^There^ was another material act, which passed this session. The |former
canons had established the celibacy of the clergy; and though this practice is
usually ascribed to the policy of the court of Rome, who thought, that the
ecclesiastics would be more devoted to their spiritual head, and less dependant
on the civil magistrate, when freed from the powerful tye of wives and children;
yet was this institution much forwarded by the principles of superstition
inherent in human nature. These principles had rendered the panegyrics on an
inviolate chastity so frequent among the ancient fathers, long before the
establishment of celibacy. And even this parliament, though they enacted a law,
permitting the marriage of priests, yet confess in the preamble, "that it were
better for priests and the ministers of the church to live chaste and without
marriage, and it were much to be wished they would of themselves abstain." The
inconveniencies, which had arisen from the compelling of chastity and the
prohibiting of marriage, are the reasons assigned for indulging a liberty in
this particular[n57]. The ideas of penance also were so much retained in other
particulars, that an act of parliament passed, forbidding the use of flesh-meat
during Lent and other times of abstinence[n58].

{#51} ^The^ principal tenets and practices of the catholic religion were now
abolished, and the reformation, such as it is enjoyed at present, was almost
entirely completed in England. But the doctrine of the real presence, though
tacitly condemned by the new communion-service and by the abolition of many
ancient rites, still retained some hold on the minds of men; and it was the last
doctrine of popery, that was wholly abandoned by the people[n59]. The great
attachment of the late king to that tenet might, in part, be the ground of this
obstinacy; but the chief cause was really the extreme absurdity of the principle
itself, and the profound veneration, which of course it impressed on the
imagination. The priests likewise were much inclined to favour an opinion, which
attributed to them so miraculous a power; and the people, who believed, that
they participated of the very body and blood of their Saviour, were loth to
renounce so extraordinary, and as they imagined, so salutary a privilege. The
general attachment to this dogma was so violent, that the Lutherans,
notwithstanding their separation from |Rome, had thought proper, under another
name, still to retain it: And the catholic preachers, in England, when
restrained in all other particulars, could not forbear, on every occasion,
inculcating that tenet. Bonner, for this offence among others, had been tried by
the council, had been deprived of his see, and had been committed to custody.
Gardiner also, who had recovered his liberty, appeared anew refractory to the
authority, which established the late innovations; and he seemed willing to
countenance that opinion, much favoured by all the English catholics, that the
king was indeed supreme head of the church, but not the council, during a
minority. Having declined to give full satisfaction on this head, he was sent to
the Tower, and threatened with farther effects of the council's displeasure.

{#52} ^These^ severities, being exercised on men, possessed of office and
authority, seemed, in that age, a necessary policy, in order to enforce a
uniformity in public worship and discipline: But there were other instances of
persecution, derived from no origin but the bigotry of theologians; a malady,
which seems almost incurable. Though the protestant divines had ventured to
renounce opinions, deemed certain during many ages, they regarded, in their
turn, the new system as so certain, that they would suffer no contradiction with
regard to it; and they were ready to burn in the same flames, from which they
themselves had so narrowly escaped, every one that had the assurance to differ
from them. A commission by act of council was granted to the primate and some
others, to examine and search after all anabaptists, heretics, or contemners of
the book of common prayer[n60]. The commissioners were injoined to reclaim them,
if possible; to impose penance on them; and to give them absolution: Or if these
criminals were obstinate, to excommunicate and imprison them, and to deliver
them over to the secular arm: And in the execution of this charge, they were not
bound to observe the ordinary methods of trial; the forms of law were dispensed
with; and if any statutes happened to interfere with the powers in the
commission, they were over-ruled and abrogated by the council. Some tradesmen in
London were brought before these commissioners, and were accused of maintaining,
among other opinions, that a man regenerate could not sin, and that, though the
outward man might offend, the inward |was incapable of all guilt. They were
prevailed on to abjure, and were dismissed. But there was a woman accused of
heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who was so pertinacious,
that the commissioners could make no impression upon her. Her doctrine was,
"That Christ was not truly incarnate of the virgin, whose flesh, being the
outward man, was sinfully begotten and born in sin; and consequently, he could
take none of it. But the word, by the consent of the inward man of the virgin,
was made flesh."[n61] This opinion, it would seem, is not orthodox; and there
was a necessity for delivering the woman to the flames for maintaining it. But
the young king, though in such tender years, had more sense than all his
counsellors and preceptors; and he long refused to sign the warrant for her
execution. Cranmer was employed to persuade him to compliance; and he said, that
there was a great difference between errors in other points of divinity, and
those which were in direct contradiction to the Apostles creed: These latter
were impieties against God, which the prince, being God's deputy, ought to
repress; in like manner, as inferior magistrates were bound to punish offences
against the king's person. Edward, overcome by importunity, at last submitted,
though with tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if any wrong were
done, the guilt should lie entirely on his head. The primate, after making a new
effort to reclaim the woman from her errors, and finding her obstinate against
all his arguments, at last committed her to the flames. Some time after, a
Dutchman, called Van Paris, accused of the heresy, which has received the name
of Arianism, was condemned to the same punishment. He suffered with so much
satisfaction, that he hugged and caressed the faggots, that were consuming him;
a species of frenzy, of which there is more than one instance among the martyrs
of that age[n62].

{#53} ^These^ rigorous methods of proceeding soon brought the whole nation to a
conformity, seeming or real, with the new doctrine and the new liturgy. The lady
Mary alone continued to adhere to the mass, and refused to admit the established
modes of worship. When pressed and menaced on this head, she applied to the
emperor; who, using his interest with Sir Philip Hobby, the English ambassador,
procured her a temporary connivance from the council[n63].

confirms this character of the popish clergy in Scotland. It became a great
dispute in the university of St. Andrews, whether the _pater_ should be said to
God or the saints. The friars, who knew in general that the reformers neglected
the saints, were determined to maintain their honour with great obstinacy, but
they knew not upon what topics to found their doctrine. Some held that the
_pater_ was said to God _formaliter,_ and to saints _materialiter;_ others, to
God _principaliter,_ and to saints _minus principaliter;_ others would have it
_ultimate_ and _non ultimate:_ But the majority seemed to hold, that the _pater_
was said to God _capiendo stricte,_ and to saints _capiendo large._ A simple
fellow, who served the sub prior, thinking there was some great matter in hand,
that made the doctors hold so many conferences together, asked him one day what
the matter was; the sub-prior answering, _Tom,_ that was the fellow's name, _we
cannot agree to whom the paternoster should be said._ He suddenly replied, _To
whom, Sir, should it be said, but unto God?_ Then said the sub-prior, _What
shall we do with the saints?_ He answered, _Give them Aves and Creeds enow in
the devil's name; for that may suffice them._ The answer going abroad, many
said, _that he had given a wiser decision than all the doctors had done with all
their distinctions._

{#n24} The famous Scotch reformer, John Knox, calls James Melvil, p. 65, a man
most gentle and most modest. It is very horrid, but at the same time somewhat
amusing, to consider the joy and alacrity and pleasure, which that historian
discovers in his narrative of this assassination: And it is remarkable that in
the first edition of his work, these words were printed on the margin of the
page, _The godly Fact and Words of James Melvil._ But the following editors
retrenched them. Knox himself had no hand in the murder of Beaton; but he
afterwards joined the assassins, and assisted them in holding out the castle.
