{#1} THE ancient and almost uninterrupted opposition of interests between the
laity and clergy in England, and between the English clergy and the court of
Rome, had sufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the sovereign
pontiff; #1534. Religious principles of the people.# and men had penetration
enough to discover abuses, which were plainly calculated for the temporal
advantages of the hierarchy, and which they found destructive of their own.
These subjects seemed proportioned to human understanding; and even the people,
who felt the |power of interest in their own breasts, could perceive the purpose
of those numerous inventions, which the interested spirit of the Roman pontiff
had introduced into religion. But when the reformers proceeded thence to dispute
concerning the nature of the sacraments, the operations of grace, the terms of
acceptance with the Deity, men were thrown into amazement, and were, during some
time, at a loss how to chuse their party. The profound ignorance in which both
the clergy and laity formerly lived, and their freedom from theological
altercations, had produced a sincere, but indolent acquiescence in received
opinions; and the multitude were neither attached to them by topics of
reasoning, nor by those prejudices and antipathies against opponents, which have
ever a more natural and powerful influence over them. As soon therefore as a new
opinion was advanced, supported by such an authority as to call up their
attention, they felt their capacity totally unfitted for such disquisitions; and
they perpetually fluctuated between the contending parties. Hence the quick and
violent movements by which the people were agitated, even in the most opposite
directions; Hence their seeming prostitution, in sacrificing to present power
the most sacred principles: And hence the rapid progress during some time, and
the sudden as well as entire check soon after, of the new doctrines. When men
were once settled in their particular sects, and had fortified themselves in a
habitual detestation of those who were denominated heretics, they adhered with
more obstinacy to the principles of their education; and the limits of the two
religions thenceforth remained fixed and unchangeable.

{#2} ^Nothing^ more forwarded the first progress of the reformers, than the
offer, which they made, of submitting all religious doctrines to private
judgment, and the summons given every one to examine the principles formerly
imposed upon him. Though the multitude were totally unqualified for this
undertaking, they yet were highly pleased with it. They fancied, that they were
exercising their judgment, while they opposed, to the prejudices of ancient
authority, more powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty itself of the
doctrines; the pleasure of an imaginary triumph in dispute; the fervent zeal of
the reformed preachers, their patience, and even alacrity, in suffering
persecution, death, and torments; a disgust at the restraints of the old
religion; an indignation |against the tyranny and interested spirit of the
ecclesiastics; these motives were prevalent with the people, and by such
considerations were men so generally induced, during that age, to throw off the
religion of their ancestors.

{#3} ^But^ in proportion as the practice of submitting religion to private
judgment was acceptable to the people, it appeared, in some respects, dangerous
to the rights of sovereigns, and seemed to destroy that implicit obedience, on
which the authority of the civil magistrate is chiefly founded. The very
precedent, of shaking so ancient and deep founded an establishment as that of
the Romish hierarchy, might, it was apprehended, prepare the way for other
innovations. The republican spirit, which naturally took place among the
reformers, encreased this jealousy. The furious insurrections of the populace,
excited by Muncer and other anabaptists in Germany[n1], furnished a new pretence
for decrying the reformation. Nor ought we to conclude, because protestants in
our time prove as dutiful subjects as those of any other communion, that
therefore such apprehensions were altogether without any shadow of plausibility.
Though the liberty of private judgment be tendered to the disciples of the
reformation, it is not in reality accepted of; and men are generally contented
to acquiesce implicitly in those establishments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.

{#4} ^No^ prince in Europe was possessed of such absolute authority as Henry,
not even the pope himself, in his own capital, where he united both the civil
and ecclesiastical powers[n2]; and there was small likelihood, that any
doctrine, which lay under the imputation of encouraging sedition, could ever
pretend to his favour and countenance. #Of the king.# But besides this political
jealousy, there was another reason, which inspired this imperious monarch with
an aversion to the reformers. He had early declared his sentiments against
Luther; and having entered the lists in those scholastic quarrels, he had
received, from his courtiers and theologians, infinite applause for his
performance. Elated by this imaginary success, and blinded by a natural
arrogance and obstinacy of temper, he had entertained the most lofty opinion of
his own erudition; and he received with impatience, mixed with contempt, any
contradiction to his |sentiments. Luther also had been so imprudent, as to treat
in a very indecent manner his royal antagonist; and though he afterwards made
the most humble submissions to Henry, and apologized for the vehemence of his
former expressions, he never could efface the hatred, which the king had
conceived against him and his doctrines. The idea of heresy still appeared
detestable as well as formidable to that prince; and whilst his resentment
against the see of Rome had corrected one considerable part of his early
prejudices, he had made it a point of honour never to relinquish the remainder.
Separate as he stood from the catholic church and from the Roman pontiff, the
head of it, he still valued himself on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on
guarding, by fire and sword, the imagined purity of his speculative principles.

{#5} #Of the ministers.# ^Henry^'s ministers and courtiers were of as motley a
character as his conduct; and seemed to waver, during this whole reign, between
the ancient and the new religion. The queen, engaged by interest as well as
inclination, favoured the cause of the reformers: Cromwel, who was created
secretary of state, and who was daily advancing in the king's confidence, had
embraced the same views; and as he was a man of prudence and abilities, he was
able, very effectually, though in a covert manner, to promote the late
innovations: Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, had secretly adopted the
protestant tenets; and he had gained Henry's friendship by his candour and
sincerity; virtues which he possessed in as eminent a degree as those times,
equally distracted with faction, and oppressed by tyranny, could easily permit.
On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk adhered to the ancient faith; and by his
high rank, as well as by his talents, both for peace and war, he had great
authority in the king's council: Gardiner, lately created bishop of Winchester,
had inlisted himself in the same party; and the suppleness of his character, and
dexterity of his conduct, had rendered him extremely useful to it.

{#6} ^All^ these ministers, while they stood in the most irreconcilable
opposition of principles to each other, were obliged to disguise their
particular opinions, and to pretend an entire agreement with the sentiments of
their master. Cromwel and Cranmer still carried the appearance of a conformity
to the ancient speculative tenets; but they artfully made use of Henry's
resentment to widen the breach with the see of Rome. Norfolk and Gardiner
feigned an |assent to the king's supremacy, and to his renunciation of the
sovereign pontiff; but they encouraged his passion for the catholic faith, and
instigated him to punish those daring heretics, who had presumed to reject his
theological principles. Both sides hoped, by their unlimited compliance, to
bring him over to their party: The king meanwhile, who held the balance between
the factions, was enabled, by the courtship payed him both by protestants and
catholics, to assume an unbounded authority: And though in all his measures he
was really driven by his ungoverned humour, he casually steered a course, which
led more certainly to arbitrary power, than any which the most profound politics
could have traced out to him. Artifice, refinement, and hypocrisy, in his
situation, would have put both parties on their guard against him, and would
have taught them reserve in complying with a monarch, whom they could never hope
thoroughly to have gained: But while the frankness, sincerity, and openness of
Henry's temper were generally known, as well as the dominion of his furious
passions; each side dreaded to lose him by the smallest opposition, and
flattered themselves that a blind compliance with his will would throw him,
cordially and fully, into their interests.

{#7} ^The^ ambiguity of the king's conduct, though it kept the courtiers in awe,
served in the main, to encourage the protestant doctrine among his subjects, and
promoted that spirit of innovation, with which the age was generally seized, and
which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a steady severity in the
administration, could be able to repress. There were some Englishmen, Tindal,
Joye, Constantine, and others, who, dreading the exertion of the king's
authority, had fled to Antwerp[n3]; where the great privileges possessed by the
Low Country provinces, served, during some time, to give them protection.
#Farther progress of the reformation.# These men employed themselves in writing
English books, against the corruptions of the church of Rome; against images,
reliques, pilgrimages; and they excited the curiosity of men with regard to that
question, the most important in theology, the terms of acceptance with the
Supreme Being. In conformity to the Lutherans and other protestants, they
asserted, that salvation was obtained by faith alone; and that the most
infallible |road to perdition[n4] was a reliance on _good works;_ by which terms
they understood, as well the moral duties, as the ceremonial and monastic
observances. The defenders of the ancient religion, on the other hand,
maintained the efficacy of _good works;_ but though they did not exclude from
this appellation the social virtues, it was still the superstitions, gainful to
the church, which they chiefly extolled and recommended. The books, composed by
these fugitives, having stolen over to England, began to make converts every
where; but it was a translation of the scriptures by Tindal, that was esteemed
the most dangerous to the established faith. The first edition of this work,
composed with little accuracy, was found liable to considerable objections; and
Tindal, who was poor, and could not afford to lose a great part of the
impression, was longing for an opportunity of correcting his errors, of which he
had been made sensible. Tonstal, then bishop of London, soon after of Durham, a
man of great moderation, being desirous to discourage, in the gentlest manner,
these innovations, gave private orders for buying up all the copies, that could
be found at Antwerp; and he burned them publicly in Cheapside. By this measure,
he supplied Tindal with money, enabled him to print a new and correct edition of
his work, and gave great scandal to the people, in thus committing to the flames
the word of God[n5].

{#8} ^The^ disciples of the reformation met with little severity during the
ministry of Wolsey, who, though himself a clergyman, bore too small a regard to
the ecclesiastical order, to serve as an instrument of their tyranny: It was
even an article of impeachment against him[n6], that by his connivance he had
encouraged the growth of heresy, and that he had protected and acquitted some
notorious offenders. #Sir Thomas More.# Sir Thomas More, who succeeded Wolsey as
Chancellor, is at once an object deserving our compassion, and an instance of
the usual progress of men's sentiments during that age. This man, whose elegant
genius and familiar acquaintance with the |noble spirit of antiquity, had given
him very enlarged sentiments, and who had in his early years advanced
principles, which even at present would be deemed somewhat too free, had, in the
course of events, been so irritated by polemics, and thrown into such a
superstitious attachment to the ancient faith, that few inquisitors have been
guilty of greater violence in their prosecution of heresy. Though adorned with
the gentlest manners, as well as the purest integrity, he carried to the utmost
height his aversion to heterodoxy; and James Bainham, in particular, a gentleman
of the Temple, experienced from him the greatest severity. Bainham, accused of
favouring the new opinions, was carried to More's house; and having refused to
discover his accomplices, the chancellor ordered him to be whipped in his
presence, and afterwards sent him to the Tower, where he himself saw him put to
the torture. The unhappy gentleman, overcome by all these severities, abjured
his opinions; but feeling afterwards the deepest compunction for his apostacy,
he openly returned to his former tenets, and even courted the crown of
martyrdom. He was condemned as an obstinate and relapsed heretic, and was burned
in Smithfield[n7].

{#9} ^Many^ were brought into the bishops' courts for offences, which appear
trivial, but which were regarded as symbols of the party: Some for teaching
their children the Lord's prayer in English; others for reading the new
testament in that language, or for speaking against pilgrimages. To harbour the
persecuted preachers, to neglect the fasts of the church, to declaim against the
vices of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas Bilney, a priest, who had
embraced the new doctrine, had been terrified into an abjuration; but was so
haunted by remorse, that his friends dreaded some fatal effects of his despair.
At last, his mind seemed to be more relieved: but this appearing calm proceeded
only from the resolution, which he had taken, of expiating his past offence, by
an open confession of the truth, and by dying a martyr to it. He went through
Norfolk, teaching the people to beware of idolatry, and of trusting for their
salvation either to pilgrimages or to the cowle of St. Francis, to the prayers
of the saints, or to images. He was soon seized, tried in the bishop's court,
and condemned as a relapsed heretic; and the writ was sent down to burn him.
When |brought to the stake, he discovered such patience, fortitude, and
devotion, that the spectators were much affected with the horrors of his
punishment; and some mendicant friars, who were present, fearing that his
martyrdom would be imputed to them, and make them lose those alms, which they
received from the charity of the people, desired him publicly to acquit them[n8]
of having any hand in his death. He willingly complied; and by this meekness
gained the more on the sympathy of the people. Another person, still more
heroic, being brought to the stake for denying the real presence, seemed almost
in a transport of joy; and he tenderly embraced the faggots, which were to be
the instruments of his punishment, as the means of procuring him eternal rest.
In short, the tide turning towards the new doctrine, those severe executions,
which, in another disposition of men's minds, would have sufficed to suppress
it, now served only to diffuse it the more among the people, and to inspire them
with horror against the unrelenting persecutors.

{#10} ^But^ though Henry neglected not to punish the protestant doctrine, which
he deemed heresy, his most formidable enemies, he knew, were the zealous
adherents to the ancient religion, chiefly the monks, who, having their
immediate dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended their own ruin to be the
certain consequence of abolishing his authority in England. Peyto, a friar,
preaching before the king, had the assurance to tell him, "That many lying
prophets had deceived him, but he as a true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs
would lick his blood, as they had done Ahab's."[n9] The king took no notice of
the insult; but allowed the preacher to depart in peace. Next Sunday he employed
Dr. Corren to preach before him; who justified the king's proceedings, and gave
Peyto the appellations of a rebel, a slanderer, a dog, and a traitor. Elston,
another friar of the same house, interrupted the preacher, and told him, that he
was one of the lying prophets, who sought to establish by adultery the
succession of the crown; but that he himself would justify all that Peyto had
said. Henry silenced the petulant friar; but showed no other mark of resentment
than ordering Peyto and him to be summoned before the council, and to be rebuked
for their offence[n10]. He even here bore patiently |some new instances of their
obstinacy and arrogance: When the earl of Essex, a privy counsellor, told them,
that they deserved for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; Elston
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as by land[n11].

{#11} ^But^ several monks were detected in a conspiracy, which, as it might have
proved more dangerous to the king, was on its discovery attended with more fatal
consequences to themselves. Elizabeth Barton, #The maid of Kent.# of Aldington
in Kent, commonly called the _holy Maid of Kent,_ had been subject to hysterical
fits, which threw her body into unusual convulsions; and having produced an
equal disorder in her mind, made her utter strange sayings, which, as she was
scarcely conscious of them during the time, had soon after entirely escaped her
memory. The silly people in the neighbourhood were struck with these
appearances, which they imagined to be supernatural; and Richard Masters, vicar
of the parish, a designing fellow, founded on them a project, from which he
hoped to acquire both profit and consideration. He went to Warham, archbishop of
Canterbury, then alive; and having given him an account of Elizabeth's
revelations, he so far wrought on that prudent, but superstitious prelate, as to
receive orders from him to watch her in her trances, and carefully to note down
all her future sayings. The regard, paid her by a person of so high a rank, soon
rendered her still more the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was
easy for Masters to persuade them, as well as the maid herself, that her ravings
were inspirations of the Holy Ghost. Knavery, as is usual, soon after succeeding
to delusion, she learned to counterfeit trances; and she then uttered, in an
extraordinary tone, such speeches as were dictated to her by her spiritual
director. Masters associated with him Dr. Bocking, a canon of Canterbury; and
their design was to raise the credit of an image of the virgin, which stood in a
chapel belonging to Masters, and to draw to it such pilgrimages as usually
frequented the more famous images and reliques. In prosecution of this design,
Elizabeth pretended revelations, which directed her to have recourse to that
image for a cure; and being brought before it, in the presence of a great
multitude, she fell anew into convulsions; and after distorting her limbs and
countenance during a competent time, she |affected to have obtained a perfect
recovery by the intercession of the virgin[n12]. This miracle was soon bruited
abroad; and the two priests, finding the imposture to succeed beyond their own
expectations, began to extend their views, and to lay the foundation of more
important enterprizes. They taught their penitent to declaim against the new
doctrines, which she denominated heresy; against innovations in ecclesiastical
government; and against the king's intended divorce from Catherine. She went so
far as to assert, that, if he prosecuted that design, and married another, he
should not be a king a month longer, and should not an hour longer enjoy the
favour of the Almighty, but should die the death of a villain. Many monks
throughout England, either from folly or roguery, or from faction, which is
often a complication of both, entered into the delusion; and one Deering, a
friar, wrote a book of the revelations and prophecies of Elizabeth[n13].
Miracles were daily added, to encrease the wonder; and the pulpit every where
resounded with accounts of the sanctity and inspirations of the new prophetess.
Messages were carried from her to queen Catherine, by which that princess was
exhorted to persist in her opposition to the divorce; the pope's ambassadors
gave encouragement to the popular credulity; and even Fisher, bishop of
Rochester, though a man of sense and learning, was carried away by an opinion so
favourable to the party which he had espoused[n14]. The king at last began to
think the matter worthy of his attention: and having ordered Elizabeth and her
accomplices to be arrested, he brought them before the star-chamber, where they
freely, without being put to the torture, made confession of their guilt. The
parliament, in the session held the beginning of this year, passed an act of
attainder against some who were engaged in this treasonable imposture[n15]; and
Elizabeth herself, Masters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Risby, Gold, suffered for
their crime. The bishop of Rochester, Abel, Addison, Lawrence, and others were
condemned for misprision of treason; because they had not discovered some
criminal speeches which they heard from Elizabeth[n16]: And they were thrown
into prison. The better to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
prophetess's miracles was detected: and even the |scandalous prostitution of her
manners was laid open to the public. Those passions, which so naturally
insinuate themselves amidst the warm intimacies maintained by the devotees of
different sexes, had taken place between Elizabeth and her confederates; and it
was found, that a door to her dormitory, which was said to have been
miraculously opened, in order to give her access to the chapel, for the sake of
frequent converse with heaven, had been contrived by Bocking and Masters for
less refined purposes.

{#12} #1535.# ^The^ detection of this imposture, attended with so many odious
circumstances, both hurt the credit of the ecclesiastics, particularly the
monks, and instigated the king to take vengeance on them. He suppressed three
monasteries of the Observantine friars; and finding that little clamour was
excited by this act of power, he was the more encouraged to lay his rapacious
hands on the remainder. Meanwhile, he exercised punishment on individuals, who
were obnoxious to him. The parliament had made it treason to endeavour depriving
the king of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his other titles,
that of supreme head of the church: It was inferred, that to deny his supremacy
was treason; and many priors and ecclesiastics lost their lives for this new
species of guilt. It was certainly a high instance of tyranny to punish the mere
delivery of a political opinion, especially one that nowise affected the king's
temporal right, as a capital offence, though attended with no overt act; and the
parliament, in passing this law, had overlooked all the principles, by which a
civilized, much more a free people, should be governed: But the violence of
changing so suddenly the whole system of government, and making it treason to
deny what, during many ages, it had been heresy to assert, is an event which may
appear somewhat extraordinary. Even the stern unrelenting mind of Henry was, at
first, shocked with these sanguinary measures; and he went so far as to change
his garb and dress; pretending sorrow for the necessity by which he was pushed
to such extremities. Still impelled, however, by his violent temper, and
desirous of striking a terror into the whole nation, #Trial and execution of
Fisher, bishop of Rochester.# he proceeded, by making examples of Fisher and
More, to consummate his lawless tyranny.

{#13} ^John^ Fisher, bishop of Rochester, was a prelate, eminent for learning
and morals, still more than for his ecclesiastical dignities, and for the high
favour, which he had long enjoyed with the king. |When he was thrown into
prison, on account of his refusing the oath which regarded the succession, and
his concealment of Elizabeth Barton's treasonable speeches, he had not only been
deprived of all his revenues, but stripped of his very cloaths, and, without
consideration of his extreme age, he was allowed nothing but rags, which
scarcely sufficed to cover his nakedness[n17]. In this condition, he lay in
prison above a twelvemonth; when the pope, willing to recompense the sufferings
of so faithful an adherent, created him a cardinal; though Fisher was so
indifferent about that dignity, that, even if the purple were lying at his feet,
he declared that he would not stoop to take it. This promotion of a man, merely
for his opposition to royal authority, rouzed the indignation of the king; and
he resolved to make the innocent person feel the effects of his resentment. #22d
June. Of Sir Thomas More.# Fisher was indicted for denying the king's supremacy,
was tried, condemned, and beheaded.

{#14} ^The^ execution of this prelate was intended as a warning to More, whose
compliance, on account of his great authority both abroad and at home, and his
high reputation for learning and virtue, was anxiously desired by the king. That
prince also bore as great personal affection and regard to More, as his
imperious mind, the sport of passions, was susceptible of towards a man, who in
any particular opposed his violent inclinations. But More could never be
prevailed on to acknowledge any opinion so contrary to his principles as that of
the king's supremacy; and though Henry exacted that compliance from the whole
nation, there was, as yet, no law obliging any one to take an oath to that
purpose. Rich, the solicitor general, was sent to confer with More, then a
prisoner, who kept a cautious silence with regard to the supremacy: He was only
inveigled to say, that any question with regard to the law, which established
that prerogative, was a two-edged sword: If a person answer one way, it will
confound his soul; if another, it will destroy his body. No more was wanted to
sound an indictment of high treason against the prisoner. His silence was called
malicious, and made a part of his crime; and these words, which had casually
dropped from him, were interpreted as a denial of the supremacy[n18]. Trials
were mere formalities during this reign: The jury gave sentence |against More,
who had long expected this fate, and who needed no preparation to fortify him
against the terrors of death. Not only his constancy, but even his cheerfulness,
nay, his usual facetiousness, never forsook him; and he made a sacrifice of his
life to his integrity with the same indifference that he maintained in any
ordinary occurrence. When he was mounting the scaffold, he said to one, "Friend,
help me up, and when I come down again, let me shift for myself." The
executioner asking him forgiveness, he granted the request, but told him, "You
will never get credit by beheading me, my neck is so short." Then laying his
head on the block, he bade the executioner stay till he put aside his beard:
"For," said he, "it never committed treason." Nothing was wanting to the glory
of this end, except a better cause, more free from weakness and superstition.
But as the man followed his principles and sense of duty, however misguided, his
constancy and integrity are not the less objects of our admiration. #6th July.#
He was beheaded in the fifty-third year of his age.

{#15} ^When^ the execution of Fisher and More was reported at Rome, especially
that of the former, who was invested with the dignity of cardinal, every one
discovered the most violent rage against the king; and numerous libels were
published, by the wits and orators of Italy, comparing him to Caligula, Nero,
Domitian, and all the most unrelenting tyrants of antiquity. Clement VII. had
died about six months after he pronounced sentence against the king; and Paul
III. of the name of Farnese, had succeeded to the papal throne. This pontiff,
who, while cardinal, had always favoured Henry's cause, had hoped, that,
personal animosities being buried with his predecessor, it might not be
impossible to form an agreement with England: And the king himself was so
desirous of accommodating matters, that, in a negociation, which he entered into
with Francis a little before this time, he required, that that monarch should
conciliate a friendship between him and the court of Rome. But Henry was
accustomed to prescribe, not to receive terms; and even while he was negociating
for peace, his usual violence often carried him to commit offences, which
rendered the quarrel totally incurable. #30th Aug.# The execution of Fisher was
regarded by Paul, as so capital an injury, that he immediately passed censures
against the king, citing him and all his adherents to appear in Rome within
ninety days, in order to answer for their crimes: If |they failed, he
excommunicated them; #King excommunicated.# deprived the king of his crown;
layed the kingdom under an interdict; declared his issue by Anne Boleyn
illegitimate; dissolved all leagues which any catholic princes had made with
him; gave his kingdom to any invader; commanded the nobility to take arms
against him; freed his subjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their
commerce with foreign states; and declared it lawful for any one to seize them,
to make slaves of their persons, and to convert their effects to his own
use[n19]. But though these censures were passed, they were not at that time
openly denounced: The pope delayed the publication, till he should find an
agreement with England entirely desperate; and till the emperor, who was at that
time hard pressed by the Turks and the protestant princes in Germany, should be
in a condition to carry the sentence into execution.

{#16} ^The^ king knew that he might expect any injury, which it should be in
Charles's power to inflict; and he therefore made it the chief object of his
policy to incapacitate that monarch from wreaking his resentment upon him[n20].
He renewed his friendship with Francis, and opened negociations for marrying his
infant-daughter, Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third son of Francis.
These two monarchs also made advances to the princes of the protestant league in
Germany, ever jealous of the emperor's ambition: And Henry, besides remitting
them some money, sent Fox, bishop of Hereford, as Francis did Bellay, lord of
Langley, to treat with them. But during the first fervours of the reformation,
an agreement in theological tenets was held, as well as a union of interests, to
be essential to a good correspondence among states; and though both Francis and
Henry flattered the German princes with hopes of their embracing the confession
of Augsbourg, it was looked upon as a bad symptom of the sincerity that they
exercised such extreme rigour against all preachers of the reformation in their
respective dominions[n21]. Henry carried the feint so far, that, while he
thought himself the first theologian in the world, he yet invited over
Melancthon, Bucer, Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines, that they might
confer with him, and instruct him in the foundation of their tenets. These
theologians were now of great importance in the world; and no poet or
philosopher, even in |ancient Greece, where they were treated with most respect,
had ever reached equal applause and admiration with those wretched composers of
metaphysical polemics. The German princes told the king, that they could not
spare their divines; and as Henry had no hopes of agreement with such zealous
disputants, and knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would not associate
with the disciples of Zuinglius, because, though they agreed in every thing
else, they differed in some minute particulars with regard to the eucharist, he
was the more indifferent on account of this refusal. He could also foresee,
that, even while the league of Smalkalde did not act in concert with him, they
would always be carried by their interests to oppose the emperor: And the hatred
between Francis and that monarch was so inveterate, that he deemed himself sure
of a sincere ally in one or other of these potentates.

{#17} #1536.# ^During^ these negociations an incident happened in England, which
promised a more amicable conclusion of those disputes, and seemed even to open
the way for a reconciliation between Henry and Charles. Queen Catherine was
seized with a lingering illness, which at last brought her to her grave: She
died at Kimbolton in the county of Huntingdon, #6th Jan. Death of queen
Catherine.# in the fiftieth year of her age. A little before she expired, she
wrote a very tender letter to the king; in which she gave him the appellation of
_her most dear Lord, King, and Husband._ She told him, that, as the hour of her
death was now approaching, she laid hold of this last opportunity to inculcate
on him the importance of his religious duty, and the comparative emptiness of
all human grandeur and enjoyment: That though his fondness towards these
perishable advantages had thrown her into many calamities, as well as created to
himself much trouble, she yet forgave him all past injuries, and hoped that his
pardon would be ratified in heaven: And that she had no other request to make,
than to recommend to him his daughter, the sole pledge of their loves; and to
crave his protection for her maids and servants. She concluded with these words,
_I_ _make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things[n22]._ The king
was touched even to the shedding of tears, by this last tender proof of
Catherine's affection; but queen Anne is said to have expressed her joy for the
death of a rival beyond what decency or humanity could permit[n23].

{#18} ^The^ emperor thought, that, as the demise of his aunt had removed all
foundation of personal animosity between him and Henry, it might not now be
impossible to detach him from the alliance of France, and to renew his own
confederacy with England, from which he had formerly reaped so much advantage.
He sent Henry proposals for a return to ancient amity, upon these
conditions[n24]; that he should be reconciled to the see of Rome, that he should
assist him in his war with the Turk, and that he should take part with him
against Francis, who now threatened the dutchy of Milan. The king replied, that
he was willing to be on good terms with the emperor, provided that prince would
acknowledge, that the former breach of friendship came entirely from himself: As
to the conditions proposed; the proceedings against the bishop of Rome were so
just, and so fully ratified by the parliament of England, that they could not
now be revoked; when Christian princes should have settled peace among
themselves, he would not fail to exert that vigour, which became him, against
the enemies of the faith; and after amity with the emperor was once fully
restored, he should then be in a situation, as a common friend both to him and
Francis, either to mediate an agreement between them, or to assist the injured
party.

{#19} ^What^ rendered Henry more indifferent to the advances made by the
emperor, was, both his experience of the usual duplicity and insincerity of that
monarch, and the intelligence which he received of the present transactions in
Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, had died without issue; and the emperor
maintained, that the dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved to him, as
head of the Germanic body: not to give umbrage, however to the states of Italy,
he professed his intention of bestowing that principality on some prince, who
should be obnoxious to no party, and he even made offer of it, to the duke of
Angouleme, third son of Francis. The French monarch, who pretended that his own
right to Milan was now revived upon Sforza's death, was content to substitute
his second son, the duke of Orleans, in his place; and the emperor pretended to
close with this proposal. But his sole intention in that liberal concession was
to gain time, till he should put himself in a warlike posture, and be able to
carry an invasion into Francis's |dominions. The ancient enmity between these
princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in personal insults on each other,
ill-becoming persons of their rank, and still less suitable to men of such
unquestioned bravery. Charles soon after invaded Provence in person, with an
army of fifty thousand men; but met with no success. His army perished with
sickness, fatigue, famine, and other disasters; and he was obliged to raise the
siege of Marseilles, and retire into Italy with the broken remains of his
forces. An army of Imperialists, near 30,000 strong, which invaded France on the
side of the Netherlands, and laid siege to Peronne, made no greater progress,
but retired upon the approach of a French army. And Henry had thus the
satisfaction to find, both that his ally, Francis, was likely to support himself
without foreign assistance, and that his own tranquillity was fully ensured by
these violent wars and animosities on the continent.

{#20} ^If^ any inquietude remained with the English court, it was solely
occasioned by the state of affairs in Scotland. James, hearing of the dangerous
situation of his ally, Francis, generously levied some forces; and embarking
them on board vessels, which he had hired for that purpose, landed them safely
in France. He even went over in person; and making haste to join the camp of the
French king, which then lay in Provence, and to partake of his danger, he met
that prince at Lyons, who, having repulsed the emperor, was now returning to his
capital. Recommended by so agreeable and seasonable an instance of friendship,
the king of Scots paid his addresses to Magdalen, daughter of the French
monarch; and this prince had no other objection to the match, than what arose
from the infirm state of his daughter's health, which seemed to threaten her
with an approaching end. But James having gained the affections of the princess,
and obtained her consent, the father would no longer oppose the united desires
of his daughter and his friend: They were accordingly married, and soon after
set sail for Scotland, where the young queen, as was foreseen, died in a little
time after her arrival. Francis, however, was afraid, lest his ally, Henry, whom
he likewise looked on as his friend, and who lived with him on a more cordial
footing than is usual among great princes, should be displeased, that this close
confederacy between France and Scotland was concluded without his participation.
He therefore dispatched Pommeraye to London, in order to apologize for |this
measure; but Henry, with his usual openness and freedom, expressed such
displeasure, that he refused even to confer with the ambassador; and Francis was
apprehensive of a rupture with a prince, who regulated his measures more by
humour and passion than by the rules of political prudence. But the king was so
fettered by the opposition, in which he was engaged against the pope and the
emperor, that he pursued no farther this disgust against Francis; and in the end
every thing remained in tranquillity both on the side of France and of Scotland.

{#21} ^The^ domestic peace of England seemed to be exposed to more hazard, by
the violent innovations in religion; and it may be affirmed, that, in this
dangerous conjuncture, nothing ensured public tranquillity so much as the
decisive authority acquired by the king, and his great ascendant over all his
subjects. Not only the devotion paid to the crown, was profound during that age:
The personal respect, inspired by Henry, was considerable; and even the terrors,
with which he over-awed every one, were not attended with any considerable
degree of hatred. His frankness, his sincerity, his magnificence, his
generosity, were virtues which counterbalanced his violence, cruelty, and
impetuosity. And the important rank, which his vigour, more than his address,
acquired him in all foreign negociations, flattered the vanity of Englishmen,
and made them the more willingly endure those domestic hardships, to which they
were exposed. The king, conscious of his advantages, was now proceeding to the
most dangerous exercise of his authority; and after paving the way for that
measure by several preparatory expedients, he was at last determined to suppress
the monasteries, and to put himself in possession of their ample revenues.

{#22} ^The^ great encrease of monasteries, if matters be considered merely in a
political light, will appear the radical inconvenience of the catholic religion;
and every other disadvantage, attending that communion, seems to have an
inseparable connection with these religious institutions. Papal usurpations, the
tyranny of the inquisition, the multiplicity of holidays; all these fetters on
liberty and industry were ultimately derived from the authority and insinuation
of monks, whose habitations, being established every where, proved so many
seminaries of supersitition and of folly. This order of men was extremely
enraged against Henry; and regarded the abolition of the papal authority in
England, as the |removal of the sole protection, which they enjoyed, against the
rapacity of the crown and of the courtiers. They were now subjected to the
king's visitation; the supposed sacredness of their bulls from Rome was
rejected; the progress of the reformation abroad, which had every where been
attended with the abolition of the monastic orders, gave them reason to
apprehend like consequences in England; and though the king still maintained the
doctrine of purgatory, to which most of the convents owed their origin and
support, it was foreseen, that, in the progress of the contest, he would every
day be led to depart wider from ancient institutions, and be drawn nearer the
tenets of the reformers, with whom his political interests naturally induced him
to unite. Moved by these considerations, the friars employed all their influence
to enflame the people against the king's government; and Henry, finding their
safety irreconcilable with his own, was determined to seize the present
opportunity, and utterly destroy his declared enemies.

{#23} ^Cromwel^, secretary of state, had been appointed vicar-general, or
vicegerent, a new office, by which the king's supremacy, or the absolute,
uncontroulable power, assumed over the church, was delegated to him. He employed
Layton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bellasis, and others, as commissioners, who
carried on, every where, a rigorous enquiry with regard to the conduct and
deportment of all the friars. During times of faction, especially of the
religious kind, no equity is to be expected from adversaries; and as it was
known, that the king's intention in this visitation was to find a pretence for
abolishing monasteries, we may naturally conclude, that the reports of the
commissioners are very little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring
in informations against their brethren; the slightest evidence was credited; and
even the calumnies, spread abroad by the friends of the reformation, were
regarded as grounds of proof. Monstrous disorders are therefore said to have
been found in many of the religious houses: Whole convents of women abandoned to
lewdness: Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of unnatural lusts
between persons of the same sex. It is indeed probable, that the blind
submission of the people, during those ages, would render the friars and nuns
more unguarded, and more dissolute, than they are in any Roman Catholic country
at present: But still, the reproaches, which it is safest to credit, are such as
point at vices, naturally |connected with the very institution of convents, and
with the monastic life. The cruel and inveterate factions and quarrels,
therefore, which the commissioners mentioned, are very credible among men, who,
being confined together within the same walls, never can forget their mutual
animosities, and who, being cut off from all the most endearing connections of
nature, are commonly cursed with hearts more selfish, and tempers more
unrelenting, than fall to the share of other men. The pious frauds, practised to
encrease the devotion and liberality of the people, may be regarded as certain,
in an order founded on illusions, lies, and superstition. The supine idleness
also, and its attendant, profound ignorance, with which the convents were
reproached, admit of no question; and though monks were the true preservers, as
well as inventors, of the dreaming and captious philosophy of the schools, no
manly or elegant knowledge could be expected among men, whose lives, condemned
to a tedious uniformity, and deprived of all emulation, afforded nothing to
raise the mind, or cultivate the genius.

{#24} ^Some^ few monasteries, terrified with this rigorous inquisition carried
on by Cromwel and his commissioners, surrendered their revenues into the king's
hands; and the monks received small pensions as the reward of their
obsequiousness. Orders were given to dismiss such nuns and friars as were below
four and twenty, whose vows were, on that account, supposed not to be binding.
The doors of the convents were opened, even to such as were above that age; and
every one recovered his liberty who desired it. But as all these expedients did
not fully answer the king's purpose, he had recourse to his usual instrument of
power, the parliament; and in order to prepare men for the innovations
projected, the report of the visitors was published, and a general horror was
endeavoured to be excited in the nation against institutions, which, to their
ancestors, had been the objects of the most profound veneration.

{#25} #4th Feb.# ^The^ king, though determined utterly to abolish the monastic
order, resolved to proceed gradually in this great work; and he gave directions
to the parliament to go no further at present, #A parliament.# than to suppress
the lesser monasteries, which possessed revenues below two hundred pounds a
year[n25]. These were found to be the most |corrupted, as lying less under the
restraint of shame, and being exposed to less scrutiny[n26]; and it was deemed
safest to begin with them, and thereby prepare the way for the greater
innovations projected. By this act three hundred and seventy-six monasteries
were suppressed, #Suppression of the lesser monasteries.# and their revenues,
amounting to thirty-two thousand pounds a year, were granted to the king;
besides their goods, chattels, and plate, computed at a hundred thousand pounds
more[n27]. It does not appear, that any opposition was made to this important
law: So absolute was Henry's authority! A court, called the court of
augmentation of the king's revenue, was erected for the management of these
funds. The people naturally concluded, from this circumstance, that Henry
intended to proceed in despoiling the church of her patrimony[n28].

{#26} ^The^ act formerly passed, empowering the king to name thirty-two
commissioners for framing a body of canon-law, was renewed; but the project was
never carried into execution. Henry thought, that the present perplexity of that
law encreased his authority, and kept the clergy in still greater dependance.

{#27} ^Farther^ progress was made in completing the union of Wales with England:
The separate jurisdictions of several great lords or marchers, as they were
called, which obstructed the course of justice in Wales, and encouraged robbery
and pillaging, were abolished; and the authority of the king's courts was
extended every where. Some jurisdictions of a like nature in England were also
abolished [n29] this session.

{#28} ^The^ commons, sensible that they had gained nothing by opposing the
king's will, when he formerly endeavoured to secure the profits of wardships and
liveries, were now contented to frame a law[n30], such as he dictated to them.
It was enacted, that the possession of land shall be adjudged to be in those who
have the use of it, not in those to whom it is transferred in trust.

{#29} #14th April.# ^After^ all these laws were passed, the king dissolved the
parliament; a parliament memorable, not only for the great and important
|innovations which it introduced, but also for the long time it had sitten, and
the frequent prorogations which it had undergone. Henry had found it so
obsequious to his will, that he did not chuse, during those religious ferments,
to hazard a new election; and he continued the same parliament above six years:
A practice, at that time, unusual in England.

{#30} #A convocation.# ^The^ convocation, which sat during this session, was
engaged in a very important work, the deliberating on the new translation which
was projected of the scriptures. The translation given by Tindal, though
corrected by himself in a new edition, was still complained of by the clergy, as
inaccurate and unfaithful; and it was now proposed to them, that they should
themselves publish a translation, which would not be liable to those objections.

{#31} ^The^ friends of the reformation asserted, that nothing could be more
absurd than to conceal, in an unknown tongue, the word of God itself, and thus
to counteract the will of heaven, which, for the purpose of universal salvation,
had published that salutary doctrine to all nations: That if this practice were
not very absurd, the artifice at least was very gross, and proved a
consciousness, that the glosses and traditions of the clergy stood in direct
opposition to the original text, dictated by Supreme Intelligence: That it was
now necessary for the people, so long abused by interested pretensions, to see
with their own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the ecclesiastics were
founded on that charter, which was on all hands acknowledged to be derived from
heaven: And that, as a spirit of research and curiosity was happily revived, and
men were now obliged to make a choice among the contending doctrines of
different sects, the proper materials for decision, and above all, the holy
scriptures, should be set before them; and the revealed will of God, which the
change of language had somewhat obscured, be again, by their means, revealed to
mankind.

{#32} ^The^ favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on the other hand,
that the pretence of making the people see with their own eyes, was a mere
cheat, and was itself a very gross artifice, by which the new preachers hoped to
obtain the guidance of them, and to seduce them from those pastors, whom the
laws, whom ancient establishments, whom heaven itself had appointed for their
spiritual direction: That the people were, by their ignorance, their stupidity,
their necessary avocations, totally unqualified to chuse |their own principles;
and it was a mockery to set materials before them, of which they could not
possibly make any proper use: That even in the affairs of common life, and in
their temporal concerns, which lay more within the compass of human reason, the
laws had, in a great measure, deprived them of the right of private judgment,
and had, happily for their own and the public interest, regulated their conduct
and behaviour: That theological questions were placed far beyond the sphere of
vulgar comprehensions; and ecclesiastics themselves, though assisted by all the
advantages of education, erudition, and an assiduous study of the science, could
not be fully assured of a just decision; except by the promise made them in
scripture, that God would be ever present with his church, and that the gates of
hell should not prevail against her: That the gross errors, adopted by the
wisest heathens, proved how unfit men were to grope their own way, through this
profound darkness; nor would the scriptures, if trusted to every man's judgment,
be able to remedy; on the contrary, they would much augment, those fatal
illusions: That sacred writ itself was involved in so much obscurity, gave rise
to so many difficulties, contained so many appearing contradictions, that it was
the most dangerous weapon, that could be entrusted into the hands of the
ignorant and giddy multitude: That the poetical style, in which a great part of
it was composed, at the same time that it occasioned uncertainty in the sense,
by its multiplied tropes and figures, was sufficient to kindle the zeal of
fanaticism, and thereby throw civil society into the most furious cumbustion:
That a thousand sects must arise, which would pretend, each of them, to derive
its tenets from the scripture; and would be able, by specious arguments, or even
without specious arguments, to seduce silly women and ignorant mechanics, into a
belief of the most monstrous principles: And that if ever this disorder,
dangerous to the magistrate himself, received a remedy, it must be from the
tacit acquiescence of the people in some new authority; and it was evidently
better, without farther contest or enquiry, to adhere peaceably to ancient, and
therefore the more secure, establishments.

{#33} ^These^ latter arguments, being more agreeable to ecclesiastical
governments, would probably have prevailed in the convocation, had it not been
for the authority of Cranmer, Latimer, and some other bishops, who were supposed
to speak the king's sense of the |matter. A vote was passed for publishing a new
translation of the scriptures; and in three years' time the work was finished,
and printed at Paris. This was deemed a great point gained by the reformers, and
a considerable advancement of their cause. Farther progress was soon expected,
after such important successes.

{#34} ^But^ while the retainers to the new religion were exulting in their
prosperity, they met with a mortification, which seemed to blast all their
hopes: Their patroness, Anne Boleyn, possessed no longer the king's favour; and
soon after lost her life, by the rage of that furious monarch. #Disgrace of
queen Anne.# Henry had persevered in his love to this lady, during six years
that his prosecution of the divorce lasted; and the more obstacles he met with
to the gratification of his passion, the more determined zeal did he exert in
pursuing his purpose. But the affection, which had subsisted, and still
encreased, under difficulties, had not long attained secure possession of its
object, when it languished from satiety; and the king's heart was apparently
estranged from his consort. Anne's enemies soon perceived the fatal change; and
they were forward to widen the breach, when they found that they incurred no
danger by interposing in those delicate concerns. She had been delivered of a
dead son; and Henry's extreme fondness for male issue being thus, for the
present, disappointed, his temper, equally violent and superstitious, was
disposed to make the innocent mother answerable for the misfortune[n31]. But the
chief means which Anne's enemies employed to inflame the king against her, was
his jealousy.

{#35} ^Anne^, though she appears to have been entirely innocent, and even
virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain gaiety, if not levity, of character,
which threw her off her guard, and made her less circumspect than her situation
required. Her education in France rendered her the more prone to those freedoms;
and it was with difficulty she conformed herself to that strict ceremonial,
practised in the court of England. More vain than haughty, she was pleased to
see the influence of her beauty on all around her, and she indulged herself in
an easy familiarity with persons, who were formerly her equals, and who might
then have pretended to her friendship and good graces. Henry's dignity was
offended with these popular manners; and though the lover had been entirely
|blind, the husband possessed but too quick discernment and penetration. Ill
instruments interposed, and put a malignant interpretation on the harmless
liberties of the queen: The viscountess of Rocheford, in particular, who was
married to the queen's brother, but who lived on bad terms with her
sister-in-law, insinuated the most cruel suspicions into the king's mind; and as
she was a woman of a profligate character, she paid no regard either to truth or
humanity in those calumnies which she suggested. She pretended, that her own
husband was engaged in a criminal correspondence with his sister; and not
content with this imputation, she poisoned every action of the queen's, and
represented each instance of favour, which she conferred on any one, as a token
of affection. Henry Norris, groom of the stole, Weston and Brereton, gentlemen
of the king's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom of the chamber, were
observed to possess much of the queen's friendship; and they served her with a
zeal and attachment, which, though chiefly derived from gratitude, might not
improbably be seasoned with some mixture of tenderness for so amiable a
princess. The king's jealousy laid hold of the slightest circumstance; and
finding no particular object on which it could fasten, it vented itself equally
on every one that came within the verge of its fury.

{#36} ^Had^ Henry's jealousy been derived from love, though it might on a sudden
have proceeded to the most violent extremities, it would have been subject to
many remorses and contrarieties; and might at last have served only to augment
that affection, on which it was founded. But it was more a stern jealousy,
fostered entirely by pride: His love was transferred to another object. Jane,
daughter of Sir John Seymour, and maid of honour to the queen, a young lady of
singular beauty and merit, had obtained an entire ascendant over him; and he was
determined to sacrifice every thing to the gratification of this new appetite.
Unlike to most monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gallantry, and who
deem the young damsels of their court rather honoured than disgraced by their
passion, he seldom thought of any other attachment than that of marriage; and in
order to attain this end, he underwent more difficulties, and committed greater
crimes, than those which he sought to avoid, by forming that legal connexion.
And having thus entertained the design of raising his new mistress to his bed
|and throne, he more willingly hearkened to every suggestion, which threw any
imputation of guilt on the unfortunate Anne Boleyn.

{#37} #1st May.# ^The^ king's jealousy first appeared openly in a tilting at
Greenwich, where the queen happened to drop her handkerchief; an incident
probably casual, but interpreted by him as an instance of gallantry to some of
her paramours[n32]. He immediately retired from the place; sent orders to
confine her to her chamber; arrested Norris, Brereton, Weston, and Smeton,
together with her brother, Rocheford; and threw them into prison. The queen,
astonished at these instances of his fury, thought that he meant only to try
her; but finding him in earnest, she reflected on his obstinate unrelenting
spirit, and she prepared herself for that melancholy doom, which was awaiting
her. Next day, she was sent to the Tower; and on her way thither, she was
informed of her supposed offences, of which she had hitherto been ignorant: She
made earnest protestations of her innocence; and when she entered the prison,
she fell on her knees, and prayed God so to help her, as she was not guilty of
the crime imputed to her. Her surprise and confusion threw her into hysterical
disorders; and in that situation, she thought that the best proof of her
innocence was to make an entire confession, and she revealed some indiscretions
and levities, which her simplicity had equally betrayed her to commit and to
avow. She owned, that she had once rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage,
and had told him, that he probably expected her, when she should be a widow: She
had reproved Weston, she said, for his affection to a kinswoman of hers, and his
indifference towards his wife: But he told her, that she had mistaken the object
of his affection, for it was herself: Upon which, she defied him[n33]. She
affirmed, that Smeton had never been in her chamber but twice, when he played on
the harpsichord: But she acknowledged, that he had once had the boldness to tell
her, that a look sufficed him. The king, instead of being satisfied with the
candour and sincerity of her confession, regarded these indiscretions only as
preludes to greater and more criminal intimacies.

{#38} ^Of^ all those multitudes, whom the beneficence of the queen's temper had
obliged, during her prosperous fortune, no one durst |interpose between her and
the king's fury; and the person, whose advancement every breath had favoured,
and every countenance had smiled upon, was now left neglected and abandoned.
Even her uncle, the duke of Norfolk, preferring the connexions of party to the
ties of blood, was become her most dangerous enemy; and all the retainers to the
catholic religion hoped, that her death would terminate the king's quarrel with
Rome, and leave him again to his natural and early bent, which had inclined him
to maintain the most intimate union with the apostolic see. Cranmer alone; of
all the queen's adherents, still retained his friendship for her; and, as far as
the king's impetuosity permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate the violent
prejudices, entertained against her.

{#39} ^The^ queen herself wrote Henry a letter from the Tower, full of the most
tender expostulations, and of the warmest protestations of innocence[n34]. This
letter had no influence on the unrelenting mind of Henry, who was determined to
pave the way for his new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris, Weston,
Brereton, and Smeton, were tried; but no legal evidence was produced against
them. The chief proof of their guilt consisted in a hear-say from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on, by the vain hopes of life, to
confess a criminal correspondence with the queen[n35]; but even her enemies
expected little advantage from this confession: For they never dared to confront
him with her; and he was immediately executed; as were also Brereton and Weston.
Norris had been much in the king's favour; and an offer of life was made him, if
he would confess his crime, and accuse the queen: But he generously rejected the
proposal; and said, that in his conscience he believed her entirely guiltless:
But, for his part, he could accuse her of nothing, and he would rather die a
thousand deaths than calumniate an innocent person.

{#40} #Her trial: and execution.# ^The^ queen and her brother were tried by a
jury of peers, consisting of the duke of Suffolk, the marquis of Exeter, the
earl of Arundel, and twenty-three more: Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk,
presided as high steward. Upon what proof or pretence the crime of incest was
imputed to them is unknown: The chief evidence, it is said, amounted to no more
than that Rocheford had been seen to lean on her bed before some company. Part
of the |charge against her was, that she had affirmed to her minions, that the
king never had her heart; and had said to each of them apart, that she loved him
better than any person whatsoever: _Which was to the slander of the issue
begotten between the king and her._ By this strained interpretation, her guilt
was brought under the statute of the 25th of this reign; in which it was
declared criminal to throw any slander upon the king, queen, or their issue.
Such palpable absurdities were, at that time, admitted; and they were regarded
by the peers of England as a sufficient reason for sacrificing an innocent queen
to the cruelty of their tyrant. Though unassisted by counsel, she defended
herself with presence of mind; and the spectators could not forbear pronouncing
her entirely innocent. Judgment, however, was given by the court, both against
the queen and lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained, that she should be
burned or beheaded at the king's pleasure. When this dreadful sentence was
pronounced, she was not terrified, but lifting up her hands to heaven, said, "O,
Father! O, Creator! thou who art the way, the truth, and the life, thou knowest
that I have not deserved this fate." And then turning to the judges, made the
most pathetic declarations of her innocence.

{#41} ^Henry^, not satisfied with this cruel vengeance, was resolved entirely to
annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn, and to declare her issue illegitimate: He
recalled to his memory, that, a little after her appearance in the English
court, some attachment had been acknowledged between her and the earl of
Northumberland, then lord Piercy; and he now questioned the nobleman with regard
to these engagements. Northumberland took an oath before the two archbishops,
that no contract or promise of marriage had ever passed between them: He
received the sacrament upon it, before the duke of Norfolk and others of the
privy council; and this solemn act he accompanied with the most solemn
protestations of veracity[n36]. The queen, however, was shaken by menaces of
executing the sentence against her in its greatest rigour, and was prevailed on
to confess in court, some lawful impediments to her marriage with the king[n37].
The afflicted primate, who sat as judge, thought himself obliged by this
confession, to pronounce the marriage null and invalid. Henry, in the transports
of his fury, did not |perceive that his proceedings were totally inconsistent,
and that, if her marriage were, from the beginning, invalid, she could not
possibly be guilty of adultery.

{#42} ^The^ queen now prepared for suffering the death to which she was
sentenced. She sent her last message to the king, and acknowledged the
obligations which she owed him, in thus uniformly continuing his endeavours for
her advancement: From a private gentlewoman, she said, he had first made her a
marchioness, then a queen, and now, since he could raise her no higher in this
world, he was sending her to be a saint in heaven. She then renewed the
protestations of her innocence, and recommended her daughter to his care. Before
the lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her, she made the like
declarations; and continued to behave herself with her usual serenity, and even
with chearfulness. "The executioner," she said to the lieutenant, "is, I hear,
very expert; and my neck is very slender." Upon which she grasped it in her
hand, and smiled. When brought, however, to the scaffold, #19th May.# she
softened her tone a little with regard to her protestations of innocence. She
probably reflected, that the obstinacy of queen Catherine, and her opposition to
the king's will, had much alienated him from the lady Mary: Her own maternal
concern, therefore, for Elizabeth, prevailed in these last moments over that
indignation, which the unjust sentence, by which she suffered, naturally excited
in her. She said, that she was come to die, as she was sentenced, by the law:
She would accuse none, nor say any thing of the ground upon which she was
judged. She prayed heartily for the king; called him a most merciful and gentle
prince; and acknowledged, that he had always been to her a good and gracious
sovereign; and if any one should think proper to canvass her cause, she desired
him to judge the best[n38]. She was beheaded by the executioner of Calais, who
was sent for as more expert than any in England. Her body was negligently thrown
into a common chest of elm-tree, made to hold arrows; and was buried in the
Tower.

{#43} ^The^ innocence of this unfortunate queen cannot reasonably be called in
question. Henry himself, in the violence of his rage, knew not whom to accuse as
her lover; and though he imputed guilt to her brother, and four persons more, he
was able to bring proof |against none of them. The whole tenour of her conduct
forbids us to ascribe to her an abandoned character, such as is implied in the
king's accusation: Had she been so lost to all prudence and sense of shame, she
must have exposed herself to detection, and afforded her enemies some evidence
against her. But the king made the most effectual apology for her, by marrying
Jane Seymour the very day after her execution[n39]. His impatience to gratify
this new passion caused him to forget all regard to decency; and his cruel heart
was not softened a moment by the bloody catastrophe of a person, who had so long
been the object of his most tender affections.

{#44} ^The^ lady Mary thought the death of her step-mother a proper opportunity
for reconciling herself to the king, who, besides other causes of disgust, had
been offended with her, on account of the part which she had taken in her
mother's quarrel. Her advances were not at first received; and Henry exacted
from her some farther proofs of submission and obedience: He required this young
princess, then about twenty years of age, to adopt his theological tenets; to
acknowledge his supremacy; to renounce the pope; and to own her mother's
marriage to be unlawful and incestuous. These points were of hard digestion with
the princess; but after some delays, and even refusals, she was at last
prevailed on to write a letter to her father[n40], containing her assent to the
articles required of her: Upon which she was received into favour. But
notwithstanding the return of the king's affection to the issue of his first
marriage, he divested not himself of kindness towards the lady Elizabeth; and
the new queen, who was blest with a singular sweetness of disposition,
discovered strong proofs of attachment towards her.

{#45} #8th June. A parliament.# ^The^ trial and conviction of queen Anne, and
the subsequent events, made it necessary for the king to summon a new
parliament; and he here, in his speech, made a merit to his people, that,
notwithstanding the misfortunes attending his two former marriages, he had been
induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The speaker received this
profession with suitable gratitude; and he took thence occasion to praise the
king for his wonderful gifts of grace and nature: He compared him, for justice
and prudence, |to Solomon; for strength and fortitude to Sampson; and for beauty
and comeliness to Absalom. The king very humbly replied, by the mouth of the
chancellor, that he disavowed these praises; since, if he were really possessed
of such endowments, they were the gift of Almighty God only. Henry found that
the parliament was no less submissive in deeds than complaisant in their
expressions, and that they would go the same lengths as the former in gratifying
even his most lawless passions. His divorce from Anne Boleyn was ratified[n41];
that queen, and all her accomplices, were attainted; the issue of both his
former marriages were declared illegitimate, and it was even made treason to
assert the legitimacy of either of them; to throw any slander upon the present
king, queen, or their issue, was subjected to the same penalty; the crown was
settled on the king's issue by Jane Seymour, or any subsequent wife; and in case
he should die without children, he was impowered, by his will or letters patent,
to dispose of the crown: An enormous authority, especially when entrusted to a
prince so violent and capricious in his humour. Whoever, being required, refused
to answer upon oath to any article of this act of settlement, was declared to be
guilty of treason, and by this clause a species of political inquisition was
established in the kingdom, as well as the accusations of treason multiplied to
an unreasonable degree. The king was also empowered to confer on any one, by his
will or letters patent, any castles, honours, liberties, or franchises; words
which might have been extended to the dismembering of the kingdom, by the
erection of principalities and independant jursidictions. It was also, by
another act, made treason to marry, without the king's consent, any princess
related in the first degree to the crown. This act was occasioned by the
discovery of a design, formed by Thomas Howard, brother of the duke of Norfolk,
to espouse the lady Margaret Douglas, niece to the king, by his sister the queen
of Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the young lady, was committed
to the Tower. She recovered her liberty soon after; but he died in |confinement.
An act of attainder passed against him this session of parliament.

{#46} ^Another^ accession was likewise gained to the authority of the crown: The
king or any of his successors was empowered to repeat or annul, by letters
patent, whatever act of parliament had been passed before he was four and twenty
years of age. Whoever maintained the authority of the bishop of Rome, by word or
writ, or endeavoured in any manner to restore it in England, was subjected to
the penalty of a premunire; that is, his goods were forfeited, and he was put
out of the protection of law. And any person who possessed any office,
ecclesiastical or civil, or received any grant or charter from the crown, and
yet refused to renounce the pope by oath, was declared to be guilty of treason.
The renunciation prescribed runs in the style of _So help me God, all saints,
and the holy evangelists[n42]._ The pope, hearing of Anne Boleyn's disgrace and
death, had hoped that the door was opened to a reconciliation, and had been
making some advances to Henry: But this was the reception he met with. Henry was
now become indifferent with regard to papal censures; and finding a great
encrease of authority, as well as of revenue, to accrue from his quarrel with
Rome, he was determined to persevere in his present measures. This parliament
also, even more than any foregoing, convinced him how much he commanded the
respect of his subjects, and what confidence he might repose in them. Though the
elections had been made on a sudden, without any preparation or intrigue, the
members discovered an unlimited attachment to his person and government[n43].

{#47} #A convocation.# ^The^ extreme complaisance of the convocation, which sat
at the same time with the parliament, encouraged him in his resolution of
breaking entirely with the court of Rome. There was secretly a great division of
sentiments in the minds of this assembly; and as the zeal of the reformers had
been augmented by some late successes, the resentment of the catholics was no
less excited by their fears and losses: But the authority of the king kept every
one submissive and silent; and the new-assumed prerogative, the supremacy, with
whose limits no one was fully acquainted, restrained even the most furious
movements of theological rancour. Cromwel |presided as vicar-general; and though
the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of queen Anne, his authority
would receive a great shock, they were surprized to find him still maintain the
same credit as before. With the vicar-general concurred Cranmer the primate,
Latimer bishop of Worcester, Shaxton of Salisbury, Hilsey of Rochester, Fox of
Hereford, Barlow of St. David's. The opposite faction was headed by Lee
archbishop of York, Stokesley bishop of London, Tonstal of Durham, Gardiner of
Winchester, Longland of Lincoln, Sherbone of Chichester, Nix of Norwich, and
Kite of Carlisle. The former party, by their opposition to the pope, seconded
the king's ambition and love of power: The latter party, by maintaining the
ancient theological tenets, were more conformable to his speculative principles:
And both of them had alternately the advantage of gaining on his humour, by
which he was more governed than by either of these motives.

{#48} ^The^ church in general was averse to the reformation; and the lower house
of convocation framed a list of opinions, in the whole sixty-seven, which they
pronounced erroneous, and which was a collection of principles, some held by the
ancient Lollards, others by the modern protestants, or Gospellers, as they were
sometimes called. These opinions they sent to the upper house to be censured;
but in the preamble of their representation, they discovered the servile spirit,
by which they were governed. They said, "that they intended not to do or speak
any thing which might be unpleasant to the king, whom they acknowledge their
supreme head, and whose commands they were resolved to obey; renouncing the
pope's usurped authority, with all his laws and inventions, now extinguished and
abolished; and addicting themselves to Almighty God and his laws, and unto the
king and the laws made within this kingdom."[n44]

{#49} ^The^ convocation came at last, after some debate, to decide articles of
faith; and their tenets were of as motley a kind as the assembly itself, or
rather as the king's system of theology, by which they were resolved entirely to
square their principles. They determined the standard of faith to consist in the
Scriptures and the three creeds, the Apostolic, Nicene, and Athanasian; and this
article was a signal victory to the reformers: Auricular confession and |penance
were admitted, a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No mention was made of
marriage, extreme unction, confirmation, or holy orders, as sacraments; and in
this omission the influence of the protestants appeared: The real presence was
asserted, conformably to the ancient doctrine: The terms of acceptance were
established to be the merits of Christ, and the mercy and good pleasure of God,
suitably to the new principles.

{#50} ^So^ far the two sects seem to have made a fair partition, by alternately
sharing the several clauses. In framing the subsequent articles, each of them
seems to have thrown in its ingredient. The catholics prevailed in asserting,
that the use of images was warranted by Scripture; the protestants, in warning
the people against idolatry, and the abuse of these sensible representations.
The ancient faith was adopted in maintaining the expedience of praying to
saints; the late innovations in rejecting the peculiar patronage of saints to
any trade, profession, or course of action. The former rites of worship, the use
of holy water, and the ceremonies practised on Ash-wednesday, Palm-sunday, Good
friday, and other festivals, were still maintained; but the new refinements,
which made light of these institutions, were also adopted, by the convocation's
denying that they had any immediate power of remitting sin, and by its asserting
that their sole merit consisted in promoting pious and devout dispositions in
the mind.

{#51} ^But^ the article, with regard to purgatory, contains the most curious
jargon, ambiguity, and hesitation, arising from the mixture of opposite tenets.
It was to this purpose: "Since according to due order of charity, and the book
of Maccabees, and divers ancient authors, it is a very good and charitable deed
to pray for souls departed; and since such a practice has been maintained in the
church from the beginning; all bishops and teachers should instruct the people
not to be grieved for the continuance of the same. But since the place where
departed souls are retained, before they reach Paradise, as well as the nature
of their pains, is left uncertain by Scripture; all such questions are to be
submitted to God, to whose mercy it is meet and convenient to commend the
deceased, trusting that he accepteth our prayers for them."[n45]

{#52} ^These^ articles, when framed by the convocation, and corrected |by the
king, were subscribed by every member of that assembly; while, perhaps, neither
there nor throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be found, except Henry
himself, who had adopted precisely these very doctrines and opinions. For though
there be not any contradiction in the tenets above mentioned, it had happened in
England, as in all countries where factious divisions have place; a certain
creed was embraced by each party, few neuters were to be found, and these
consisted only of speculative or whimsical people, of whom two persons could
scarcely be brought to an agreement in the same dogmas. The protestants, all of
them, carried their opposition to Rome farther than those articles: None of the
catholics went so far: And the king, by being able to retain the nation in such
a delicate medium, displayed the utmost power of an imperious despotism, of
which any history furnishes an example. To change the religion of a country,
even when seconded by a party, is one of the most perilous enterprizes, which
any sovereign can attempt, and often proves the most destructive to royal
authority. But Henry was able to set the political machine in that furious
movement, and yet regulate and even stop its career: He could say to it, Thus
far shalt thou go and no farther: And he made every vote of his parliament and
convocation subservient, not only to his interests and passions, but even to his
greatest caprices; nay, to his most refined and most scholastic subtilties.

{#53} ^The^ concurrence of these two national assemblies served, no doubt, to
encrease the king's power over the people, and raised him to an authority more
absolute, than any prince, in a simple monarchy, even by means of military
force, is ever able to attain. But there are certain bounds, beyond which the
most slavish submission cannot be extended. All the late innovations,
particularly the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, and the imminent danger
to which all the rest were exposed, [n46] had bred discontent among the people,
and had disposed them to revolt. The expelled monks, wandering about the
country, excited both the piety and compassion of men; #Discontents among the
people.# and as the ancient religion took hold of the populace by powerful
motives, suited to vulgar capacity, it was able, now that it was brought into
apparent hazard, to raise the strongest zeal in its favour[n47]. Discontents had
even reached some of the nobility and |gentry, whose ancestors had founded the
monasteries, and who placed a vanity in those institutions, as well as reaped
some benefit from them, by the provisions which they afforded them for their
younger children. The more superstitious were interested for the souls of their
forefathers, which, they believed, must now lie, during many ages, in the
torments of purgatory, for want of masses to relieve them. It seemed unjust to
abolish pious institutions for the faults, real or pretended, of individuals.
Even the most moderate and reasonable deemed it somewhat iniquitous, that men,
who had been invited into a course of life by all the laws, human and divine,
which prevailed in their country, should be turned out of their possessions, and
so little care be taken of their future subsistence. And when it was observed,
that the rapacity and bribery of the commissioners and others, employed in
visiting the monasteries, intercepted much of the profits resulting from these
confiscations, it tended much to encrease the general discontent[n48].

{#54} ^But^ the people did not break into open sedition, till the complaints of
the secular clergy concurred with those of the regular. As Cromwel's person was
little acceptable to the ecclesiastics; the authority, which he exercised, being
so new, so absolute, so unlimited, inspired them with disgust and terror. He
published, in the king's name, without the consent either of parliament or
convocation, an ordonance, by which he retrenched many of the ancient holydays;
prohibited several superstitions, gainful to the clergy, such as pilgrimages,
images, reliques, and even ordered the incumbents in the parishes to set apart a
considerable portion of their revenue for repairs, and for the support of
exhibitioners and the poor of their parish. The secular priests, finding
themselves thus reduced to a grievous servitude, instilled into the people those
discontents, which they had long harboured in their own bosoms.

{#55} ^The^ first rising was in Lincolnshire. It was headed by Dr. Mackrel,
prior of Barlings, who was disguised like a mean mechanic, and who bore the name
of captain Cobler. This tumultuary army amounted to above 20,000 men[n49];
#Insurrection.# but notwithstanding their number, they showed little disposition
of proceeding to extremities against the king, and seemed still overawed by his
authority. They acknowledged him to be supreme head of the church of England;
|but they complained of suppressing the monasteries, of evil counsellors, of
persons meanly born raised to dignity, of the danger to which the jewels and
plate of their parochial churches were exposed: And they prayed the king to
consult the nobility of the realm concerning the redress of these
grievances[n50]. Henry was little disposed to entertain apprehensions of danger,
especially from a low multitude, whom he despised. #6th Octob.# He sent forces
against the rebels under the command of the duke of Suffolk; and he returned
them a very sharp answer to their petition. There were some gentry, whom the
populace had constrained to take part with them, and who kept a secret
correspondence with Suffolk. They informed him, that resentment against the
king's reply was the chief cause, which retained the malcontents in arms, and
that a milder answer would probably suppress the rebellion. Henry had levied a
great force at London, with which he was preparing to march against the rebels;
and being so well supported by power, he thought, that, without losing his
dignity, he might now show them some greater condescension. He sent a new
proclamation, requiring them to return to their obedience, with secret
assurances of pardon. This expedient had its effect: The populace was dispersed:
Mackrel and some of their leaders fell into the king's hands, and were executed:
The greater part of the multitude retired peaceably to their usual occupations:
A few of the more obstinate fled to the north, where they joined the
insurrection that was raised in those parts.

{#56} ^The^ northern rebels, as they were more numerous, were also, on other
accounts, more formidable than those of Lincolnshire; because the people were
there more accustomed to arms, and because of their vicinity to the Scots, who
might make advantage of these disorders. One Aske, a gentleman, had taken the
command of them, and he possessed the art of governing the populace. Their
enterprize they called the _Pilgrimage of Grace:_ Some priests marched before in
the habits of their order, carrying crosses in their hands: In their banners was
woven a crucifix, with the representation of a chalice, and of the five wounds
of Christ[n51]: They wore on their sleeve an emblem of the five wounds, with the
name of Jesus wrought in the middle: They all took an oath, that they had
entered into the pilgrimage of grace from no other motive, than |their love to
God, their care of the king's person and issue, their desire of purifying the
nobility, of driving base-born persons from about the king, of restoring the
church, and of suppressing heresy. Allured by these fair pretences, about 40,000
men from the counties of York, Durham, Lancaster, and those northern provinces,
flocked to their standard; and their zeal, no less than their numbers, inspired
the court with apprehensions.

{#57} ^The^ earl of Shrewsbury, moved by his regard for the king's service,
raised forces, though at first without any commission, in order to oppose the
rebels. The earl of Cumberland repulsed them from his castle of Skipton: Sir
Ralph Evers defended Scarborow-castle against them[n52]: Courtney, marquis of
Exeter, the king's cousin-german, obeyed orders from court, and levied troops.
The earls of Huntingdon, Derby, and Rutland, imitated his example. The rebels,
however, prevailed in taking both Hull and York: They had laid siege to Pomfret
castle, into which the archbishop of York and lord Darcy had thrown themselves.
It was soon surrendered to them; and the prelate and nobleman, who secretly
wished success to the insurrection, seemed to yield to the force imposed on
them, and joined the rebels.

{#58} ^The^ duke of Norfolk was appointed general of the king's forces against
the northern rebels; and as he headed the party at court, which supported the
ancient religion, he was also suspected of bearing some favour to the cause,
which he was sent to oppose. His prudent conduct, however, seems to acquit him
of this imputation. He encamped near Doncaster, together with the earl of
Shrewsbury; and as his army was small, scarcely exceeding five thousand men, he
made choice of a post, where he had a river in front, the ford of which he
purposed to defend against the rebels. They had intended to attack him in the
morning; but during the night, there fell such violent rains as rendered the
river utterly unpassable; and Norfolk wisely laid hold of the opportunity to
enter into treaty with them. In order to open the door for negociation, he sent
them a herald; whom Aske, their leader, received with great ceremony; he himself
sitting in a chair of state, with the archbishop of York on one hand, and lord
Darcy on the other. It was agreed, that two gentlemen should be dispatched to
the king with proposals from |the rebels; and Henry purposely delayed giving an
answer, and allured them with hopes of entire satisfaction, in expectation that
necessity would soon oblige them to disperse themselves. Being informed, that
his artifice had, in a great measure, succeeded, he required them instantly to
lay down their arms and submit to mercy; promising a pardon to all except six
whom he named, and four whom he reserved to himself the power of naming. But
though the greater part of the rebels had gone home for want of subsistence,
they had entered into the most solemn engagements to return to their standards,
in case the king's answer should not prove satisfactory. Norfolk, therefore,
soon found himself in the same difficulty as before; and he opened again a
negociation with the leaders of the multitude. He engaged them to send three
hundred persons to Doncaster, with proposals for an accommodation; and he hoped,
by intrigue and separate interests, to throw dissention among so great a number.
Aske himself had intended to be one of the deputies, and he required a hostage
for his security: But the king, when consulted, replied, that he knew no
gentleman or other, whom he esteemed so little as to put him in pledge for such
a villain. The demands of the rebels were so exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected
them, and they prepared again to decide the contest by arms. They were as
formidable as ever both by their numbers and spirit; and notwithstanding the
small river, which lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great reason
to dread the effects of their fury. But while they were preparing to pass the
ford, rain fell a second time in such abundance, as made it impracticable for
them to execute their design; and the populace, partly reduced to necessity by
want of provisions, partly struck with superstition at being thus again
disappointed by the same accident, suddenly dispersed themselves. The duke of
Norfolk, who had received powers for that end, forwarded the dispersion, #9th
Dec.# by the promise of a general amnesty; and the king ratified this act of
clemency. He published, however, a manifesto against the rebels, and an answer
to their complaints; in which he employed a very lofty style, suited to so
haughty a monarch. He told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a
judgement with regard to government, than a blind man with regard to colours:
"And we," he added, "with our whole council, think it right |strange, that ye,
who be but brutes and inexpert folk, do take upon you to appoint us, who be meet
or not for our council."

{#59} ^As^ this pacification was not likely to be of long continuance, Norfolk
was ordered to keep his army together, and to march into the northern parts, in
order to exact a general submission. Lord Darcy, as well as Aske, was sent for
to court; and the former, upon his refusal or delay to appear, was thrown into
prison. Every place was full of jealousy and complaints. A new insurrection
broke out, headed by Musgrave and Tilby; and the rebels besieged Carlisle with
8000 men. Being repulsed by that city, they were encountered in their retreat by
Norfolk, who put them to flight; #1537.# and having made prisoners of all their
officers, except Musgrave, who escaped, he instantly put them to death by
martial law, to the number of seventy persons. An attempt, made by Sir Francis
Bigot and Halam to surprize Hull, met with no better success; and several other
risings were suppressed by the vigilance of Norfolk. The king, enraged by these
multiplied revolts, was determined not to adhere to the general pardon, which he
had granted; and from a movement of his usual violence, he made the innocent
suffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his master, spread the royal
banner, and, wherever he thought proper, executed martial law in the punishment
of offenders. Besides Aske, leader of the first insurrection, Sir Robert
Constable, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Piercy, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas
Tempest, William Lumley, and many others, were thrown into prison; and most of
them were condemned and executed. Lord Hussey was found guilty as an accomplice
in the insurrection of Lincolnshire, and was executed at Lincoln. Lord Darcy,
though he pleaded compulsion, and appealed, for his justification, to a long
life, spent in the service of the crown, was beheaded on Tower-hill. Before his
execution, he accused Norfolk of having secretly encouraged the rebels; but
Henry, either sensible of that nobleman's services and convinced of his
fidelity, or afraid to offend one of such extensive power and great capacity,
rejected the information. Being now satiated with punishing the rebels, he
published anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered[n53]; and he
erected by patent a court of |justice at York, for deciding law-suits in the
northern counties: A demand which had been made by the rebels.

{#60} ^Soon^ after this prosperous success, an event happened, which crowned
Henry's joy, #October 12. Birth of Prince Edward, and death of Q. Jane.# the
birth of a son, who was baptized by the name of Edward. Yet was not his
happiness without allay: The queen died two days after[n54]. But a son had so
long been ardently wished for by Henry, and was now become so necessary, in
order to prevent disputes with regard to the succession, after the acts
declaring the two princesses illegitimate, that the king's affliction was
drowned in his joy, and he expressed great satisfaction on the occasion. The
prince, not six days old, was created prince of Wales, duke of Cornwal, and earl
of Chester. Sir Edward Seymour, the queen's brother, formerly made Lord
Beauchamp, was raised to the dignity of earl of Hertford. Sir William Fitz
Williams, high admiral, was created earl of Southampton; Sir William Paulet,
Lord St. John; Sir John Russel, Lord Russel.

{#61} #1538.# ^The^ suppression of the rebellion and the birth of a son, as they
confirmed Henry's authority at home, encreased his consideration among foreign
princes, and made his alliance be courted by all parties. He maintained,
however, a neutrality in the wars, which were carried on, with various success,
and without any decisive event, between Charles and Francis; and though inclined
more to favour the latter, he determined not to incur, without necessity, either
hazard or expence on his account. A truce, concluded about this time between
these potentates, and afterwards prolonged for ten years, freed him from all
anxiety on account of his ally, and re-established the tranquillity of Europe.

{#62} ^Henry^ continued desirous of cementing a union with the German
protestants; and for that purpose, he sent Christopher Mount to a congress which
they held at Brunswick; but that minister made no great progress in his
negociation. The princes wished to know, what were the articles in their
confession which Henry disliked; and they sent new ambassadors to him, who had
orders both to negociate and to dispute. They endeavoured to convince the king,
that he was guilty of a mistake, in administering the eucharist in one kind
only, in allowing private masses, and in requiring the |celibacy of the
clergy[n55]. Henry would by no means acknowledge any error in these particulars;
and was displeased that they should pretend to prescribe rules to so great a
monarch and theologian. He found arguments and syllogisms enow to defend his
cause; and he dismissed the ambassador without coming to any conclusion. Jealous
also least his own subjects should become such theologians as to question his
tenets, he used great precaution in publishing that translation of the scripture
which was finished this year. He would only allow a copy of it to be deposited
in some parish churches, where it was fixed by a chain: And he took care to
inform the people by proclamation, "That this indulgence was not the effect of
his duty, but of his goodness and his liberality to them; who therefore should
use it moderately, for the encrease of virtue, not of strife: And he ordered
that no man should read the Bible aloud, so as to disturb the priest, while he
sang mass, nor presume to expound doubtful places, without advice from the
learned." In this measure, as in the rest, he still halted half way between the
catholics and the protestants.

{#63} ^There^ was only one particular, in which Henry was quite decisive;
because he was there impelled by his avarice, or more properly speaking, his
rapacity, the consequence of his profusion: This measure was the entire
destruction of the monasteries. #Suppression of the greater monasteries.# The
present opportunity seemed favourable for that great enterprize, while the
suppression of the late rebellion fortified and encreased the royal authority;
and as some of the abbots were suspected of having encouraged the insurrection,
and of corresponding with the rebels, the king's resentment was farther incited
by that motive. A new visitation was appointed of all the monasteries in
England; and a pretence only being wanted for their suppression, it was easy for
a prince, possessed of such unlimited power, and seconding the present humour of
a great part of the nation, to find or feign one. The abbots and monks knew the
danger, to which they were exposed; and having learned, by the example of the
lesser monasteries, that nothing could withstand the king's will, they were most
of them induced, in expectation of better treatment, to make a voluntary
resignation of their houses. Where |promises failed of effect, menaces and even
extreme violence were employed; and as several of the abbots, since the breach
with Rome, had been named by the court, with a view to this event, the king's
intentions were the more easily effected. Some also, having secretly embraced
the doctrine of the reformation, were glad to be freed from their vows; and on
the whole the design was conducted with such success, that, in less than two
years, the king had got possession of all the monastic revenues.

{#64} ^In^ several places, particularly in the county of Oxford, great interest
was made to preserve some convents of women, who, as they lived in the most
irreproachable manner, justly merited, it was thought, that their houses should
be saved from the general destruction[n56]. There appeared also great difference
between the case of nuns and that of friars; and the one institution might be
laudable, while the other was exposed to much blame. The males of all ranks, if
endowed with industry, might be of service to the public; and none of them could
want employment, suited to his station and capacity. But a woman of a family,
who failed of a settlement in the married state, an accident to which such
persons were more liable than women of lower station, had really no rank which
she properly filled: and a convent was a retreat both honourable and agreeable,
from the inutility and often want, which attended her situation. But the king
was determined to abolish monasteries of every denomination; and probably
thought, that these ancient establishments would be the sooner forgotten, if no
remains of them, of any kind, were allowed to subsist in the kingdom.

{#65} ^The^ better to reconcile the people to this great innovation, stories
were propagated of the detestable lives of the friars in many of the convents;
and great care was taken to defame those whom the court had determined to ruin.
The reliques also and other superstitions, which had so long been the object of
the people's veneration, were exposed to their ridicule; and the religious
spirit, now less bent on exterior observances and sensible objects, was
encouraged in this new direction. It is needless to be prolix in an enumeration
of particulars: Protestant historians mention on this occasion with great
triumph the sacred repositories of convents; the parings of St. Edmond's toes;
some of the coals that roasted St. |Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin shown in
eleven several places; two or three heads of St. Ursula; the felt of St. Thomas
of Lancaster, an infallible cure for the head-ach; part of St. Thomas of
Canterbury's shirt, much reverenced by big-bellied women; some reliques, an
excellent preventive against rain; others, a remedy to weeds in corn. But such
fooleries, as they are to be found in all ages and nations, and even took place
during the most refined periods of antiquity, form no particular or violent
reproach to the catholic religion.

{#66} ^There^ were also discovered, or said to be discovered, in the monasteries
some impostures of a more artificial nature. At Hales, in the county of
Gloucester, there had been shown, during several ages, the blood of Christ
brought from Jerusalem; and it is easy to imagine the veneration with which such
a relique was regarded. A miraculous circumstance also attended this miraculous
relique; the sacred blood was not visible to any one in mortal sin, even when
set before him; and till he had performed good works sufficient for his
absolution, it would not deign to discover itself to him. At the dissolution of
the monastery, the whole contrivance was detected. Two of the monks, who were
let into the secret, had taken the blood of a duck, which they renewed every
week: They put it in a phial, one side of which consisted of thin and
transparent chrystal, the other of thick and opaque. When any rich pilgrim
arrived, they were sure to show him the dark side of the phial, till masses and
offerings had expiated his offences; and then finding his money, or patience, or
faith, nearly exhausted, they made him happy by turning the phial[n57].

{#67} ^A^ miraculous crucifix had been kept at Boxley in Kent, and bore the
appellation of the _Rood of Grace._ The lips, and eyes, and head of the image
moved on the approach of its votaries. Hilsey, bishop of Rochester, broke the
crucifix at St. Paul's cross, and showed to the whole people the springs and
wheels by which it had been secretly moved. A great wooden idol revered in
Wales, called Darvel Gatherin, was also brought to London, and cut in pieces:
And by a cruel refinement in vengeance, it was employed as fuel to burn friar
Forest[n58], who was punished for denying the supremacy, |and for some pretended
heresies. A finger of St. Andrew's, covered with a thin plate silver, had been
pawned by a convent for a debt of forty pounds; but as the king's commissioners
refused to pay the debt, people made themselves merry with the poor creditor, on
account of his pledge.

{#68} ^But^ of all the instruments of ancient superstition, no one was so
zealously destroyed as the shrine of Thomas a Becket, commonly called St. Thomas
of Canterbury. This saint owed his canonization to the zealous defence, which he
had made for clerical privileges; and on that account also, the monks had
extremely encouraged the devotion of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and
numberless were the miracles, which, they pretended, his reliques wrought in
favour of his devout votaries. They raised his body once a year; and the day on
which this ceremony was performed, which was called the day of his translation,
was a general holiday: Every fiftieth year there was celebrated a jubilee to his
honour, which lasted fifteen days: Plenary indulgences were then granted to all
that visited his tomb; and a hundred thousand pilgrims have been registered at a
time in Canterbury. The devotion towards him had quite effaced in that place the
adoration of the Deity: nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's altar, for
instance, there were offered in one year three pounds two shillings and six
pence; at the Virgin's, sixty-three pounds five shillings and six pence; at St.
Thomas's, eight hundred and thirty-two pounds twelve shillings and three pence.
But next year, the disproportion was still greater: There was not a penny
offered at God's altar; the Virgin's gained only four pounds one shilling and
eight pence; but St. Thomas had got for his share nine hundred and fifty-four
pounds six shillings and three pence[n59]. Lewis VII, of France had made a
pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had bestowed on the shrine a jewel,
esteemed the richest in Christendom. It is evident, how obnoxious to Henry a
saint of this character must appear, and how contrary to all his projects for
degrading the authority of the court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich
shrine, dedicated to St. Thomas: he made the saint himself be cited to appear in
court, and be tried and condemned as a traitor: He ordered his name to be struck
out of the calendar; the office for his festival to be expunged from all
breviaries; his bones to be burned, and the ashes to be thrown in the air.

{#69} ^On^ the whole, the king, at different times, suppressed six hundred and
forty-five monasteries: Of which twenty-eight had abbots, that enjoyed a seat in
parliament. Ninety colleges were demolished in several counties; two thousand
three hundred and seventy-four chantries and free chapels: A hundred and ten
hospitals. The whole revenue of these establishments amounted to one hundred and
sixty-one thousand one hundred pounds[n60]. It is worthy of observation, that
all the lands and possessions and revenue of England had, a little before this
period, been rated at four millions a year; so that the revenues of the monks,
even comprehending the lesser monasteries, did not exceed the twentieth part of
the national income: A sum vastly inferior to what is commonly apprehended. The
lands belonging to the convents, were usually let at very low rent; and the
farmers, who regarded themselves as a species of proprietors, took always care
to renew their leases before they expired[n61].

{#70} ^Great^ murmurs were every where excited on account of these violences;
and men much questioned, whether priors and monks, who were only trustees or
tenants for life, could, by any deed, however voluntary, transfer to the king
the entire property of their estates. In order to reconcile the people to such
mighty innovations, they were told, that the king would never thenceforth have
occasion to levy taxes, but would be able from the abbey lands alone, to bear,
during war as well as peace, the whole charges of government[n62]. While such
topics were employed to appease the populace, Henry took an effectual method of
interesting the nobility and gentry in the success of his measures[n63]: He
either made a gift of the revenues of convents to his favourites and courtiers,
or sold them at low prices, or exchanged them for other lands on very
disadvantageous terms. He was so profuse in these liberalities, that he is said
to have given a woman the whole revenue of a convent, as a reward for making a
pudding, which happened to gratify his palate[n64]. He also settled pensions on
the abbots and priors, proportioned to their former revenues or to their merits;
and gave each monk a yearly pension of eight marks: He erected six new
bishoprics, Westminster, Oxford, Peterborow, Bristol, Chester, and Gloucester;
of which five subsist at this day: And by all these means |of expence and
dissipation, the profit, which the king reaped by the seizure of church lands,
fell much short of vulgar opinion. As the ruin of convents had been foreseen
some years before it happened, the monks had taken care to secrete most of their
stock, furniture, and plate; so that the spoils of the great monasteries bore
not, in these respects, any proportion to those of the lesser.

{#71} ^Beside^ the lands, possessed by the monasteries, the regular clergy
enjoyed a considerable part of the benefices of England, and of the tythes,
annexed to them; and these were also at this time transferred to the crown, and
by that means passed into the hands of laymen: An abuse which many zealous
churchmen regard as the most criminal sacrilege. The monks were formerly much at
their ease in England, and enjoyed revenues, which exceeded the regular and
stated expence of the house. We read of the abbey of Chertsey in Surrey, which
possessed 744 pounds a year, though it contained only fourteen monks: That of
Furnese, in the county of Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and
contained but thirty[n65]. In order to dissipate their revenues, and support
popularity, the monks lived in a hospitable manner; and besides the poor,
maintained from their offals, there were many decayed gentlemen, who passed
their lives in travelling from convent to convent, and were entirely subsisted
at the tables of the friars. By this hospitality, as much as by their own
inactivity, did the convents prove nurseries of idleness; but the king, not to
give offence by too sudden an innovation, bound the new proprietors of abbey
lands, to support the ancient hospitality. But this engagement was fulfilled in
very few places, and for a very short time.

{#72} ^It^ is easy to imagine the indignation, with which the intelligence of
all these acts of violence was received at Rome; and how much the ecclesiastics
of that court, who had so long kept the world in subjection by high sounding
epithets, and by holy execrations, would now vent their rhetoric against the
character and conduct of Henry. The pope was at last incited to publish the
bull, which had been passed against that monarch; and in a public manner he
delivered over his soul to the devil, and his dominions to the first invader.
Libels were dispersed, in which he was anew compared to the most furious
persecutors in antiquity; and the preference was |now given to their side: He
had declared war with the dead, whom the pagans themselves respected; was at
open hostility with heaven; and had engaged in professed enmity with the whole
host of saints and angels. Above all, he was often reproached with his
resemblance to the emperor Julian, whom, it was said, he imitated in his
apostacy and learning, though he fell short of him in morals. Henry could
distinguish in some of these libels the stile and animosity of his kinsman,
Pole; and he was thence incited to vent his rage, by every possible expedient,
on that famous cardinal.

{#73} #Cardinal Pole.# ^Reginald^ de la Pole, or Reginald Pole, was descended
from the royal family, being fourth son of the countess of Salisbury, daughter
of the duke of Clarence. He gave in early youth indications of that fine genius,
and generous disposition, by which, during his whole life, he was so much
distinguished; and Henry, having conceived great friendship for him, intended to
raise him to the highest ecclesiastical dignities; and, as a pledge of future
favours, he conferred on him the deanry of Exeter[n66], the better to support
him in his education. Pole was carrying on his studies in the university of
Paris, at the time when the king solicited the suffrages of that learned body in
favour of his divorce; but though applied to by the English agent, he declined
taking any part in the affair. Henry bore this neglect with more temper than was
natural to him; and he appeared unwilling, on that account, to renounce all
friendship with a person, whose virtues and talents, he hoped, would prove
useful, as well as ornamental, to his court and kingdom. He allowed him still to
possess his deanry, and gave him permission to finish his studies at Padua: He
even paid him some court, in order to bring him into his measures; and wrote to
him, while in that university, desiring him to give his opinion freely, with
regard to the late measures taken in England, for abolishing the papal
authority. Pole had now contracted an intimate friendship with all persons
eminent for dignity or merit in Italy, Sadolet, Bembo, and other revivers of
true taste and learning; and he was moved by these connections, as well as by
religious zeal, to forget, in some respect, the duty which he owed to Henry, his
benefactor, and his sovereign. He replied, by writing a treatise of _the unity
of the church,_ in which he inveighed against the king's supremacy, his divorce,
|his second marriage; and he even exhorted the emperor to revenge on him the
injury done to the Imperial family, and to the catholic cause. Henry, though
provoked beyond measure at this outrage, dissembled his resentment; and he sent
a message to Pole, desiring him to return to England, in order to explain
certain passages in his book, which he found somewhat obscure and difficult.
Pole was on his guard against this insidious invitation, and was determined to
remain in Italy, where he was universally beloved.

{#74} ^The^ pope and emperor thought themselves obliged to provide for a man of
Pole's eminence and dignity, who, in support of their cause, had sacrificed all
his pretensions to fortune in his own country. He was created a cardinal; and
though he took not higher orders than those of a deacon, he was sent legate into
Flanders about the year 1536[n67]. Henry was sensible, that Pole's chief
intention in chusing that employment, was to foment the mutinous disposition of
the English catholics; and he therefore remonstrated in so vigorous a manner
with the queen of Hungary, regent of the Low Countries, that she dismissed the
legate, without allowing him to exercise his functions. The enmity, which he
bore to Pole, was now as open, as it was violent; and the cardinal, on his part,
kept no farther measures in his intrigues against Henry. He is even suspected of
having aspired to the crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary; and the
king was every day more alarmed by informations, which he received, of the
correspondence maintained in England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of
Exeter, had entered into a conspiracy with him; Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the
lord Abergavenny, Sir Nicholas Carew, master of horse, and knight of the garter;
Henry de la Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, brothers to the
cardinal. These persons were indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord
Audley, who presided in the trial, as high steward, they were all executed,
except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his
having first carried to the king secret intelligence of the conspiracy. We know
little concerning the justice or iniquity of the sentence pronounced against
these men: We only know, that the condemnation of a man, who was, at that time,
|prosecuted by the court, forms no presumption of his guilt; though, as no
historian of credit mentions, in the present case, any complaint occasioned by
these trials, we may presume, that sufficient evidence was produced against the
marquis of Exeter, and his associates[n68].

{#n34} This letter contains so much nature and even elegance, as to deserve to
be transmitted to posterity, without any alteration in the expression. It is as
follows."Sir, your grace's displeasure and my imprisonment are things so strange
unto me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas
you send unto me (willing me to confess a truth, and so obtain your favour) by
such an one, whom you know to be mine ancient professed enemy, I no sooner
received this message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning; and, if, as
you say, confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all
willingness and duty perform your command.""But let not your grace ever imagine,
that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not so
much as a thought thereof preceded. And to speak a truth, never prince had wife
more loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in
Anne Boleyn: With which name and place I could willingly have contented myself,
if God and your grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time
so far forget myself in my exaltation or received queenship, but that I always
looked for such an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment
being on no surer foundation than your grace's fancy, the least alteration I
knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object. You have
chosen me from a low estate to be your queen and companion, far beyond my desert
or desire. If then you found me worthy of such honour, good your grace let not
any light fancy, or bad counsel of mine enemies, withdraw your princely favour
from me; neither let that stain, that unworthy stain, of a disloyal heart
towards your good grace, ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife, and
the infant princess your daughter. Try me, good king, but let me have a lawful
trial, and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and judges; yea let me
receive an open trial, for my truth shall fear no open shame; then shall you see
either mine innocence cleared, your suspicion and conscience satisfied, the
ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my guilt openly declared. So that
whatsoever God or you may determine of me, your grace may be freed from an open
censure, and mine offence being so lawfully proved, your grace is at liberty,
both before God and man, not only to execute worthy punishment on me as an
unlawful wife, but to follow your affection, already settled on that party, for
whose sake I am now as I am, whose name I could some good while since have
pointed unto, your grace not being ignorant of my suspicion therein.""But if you
have already determined of me, and that not only my death, but an infamous
slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness; then I desire of
God, that he will pardon your great sin therein, and likewise mine enemies, the
instruments thereof, and that he will not call you to a strict account for your
unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his general judgment-seat, where both you
and myself must shortly appear, and in whose judgment I doubt not (whatsoever
the world may think of me) mine innocence shall be openly known, and
sufficiently cleared."My last and only request shall be, that myself may only
bear the burden of your grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch the
innocent souls of those poor gentlemen, who (as I understand) are likewise in
strait imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found favour in your sight, if
ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me obtain
this request, and I will so leave to trouble your grace any further, with mine
earnest prayers to the Trinity to have your grace in his good keeping, and to
direct you in all your actions. From my doleful prison in the Tower, this sixth
of May;"Your most loyal and ever faithful wife, Anne Boleyn."

highness."

{#n46} A proposal had formerly been made in the convocation for the abolition of
the lesser monasteries; and had been much opposed by bishop Fisher, who was then
alive. He told his brethren, that this was fairly showing the king the way, how
he might come at the greater monasteries. "An ax," said he, "which wanted a
handle, came upon a time into the wood, making his moan to the great trees, that
he wanted a handle to work withal, and for that cause he was constrained to sit
idle; therefore he made it his request to them, that they would be pleased to
grant him one of their small saplings within the wood to make him a handle; who,
mistrusting no guile, granted him one of their smaller trees to make him a
handle. But now becoming a complete ax, he fell so to work, within the same
wood, that, in process of time, there was neither great nor small trees to be
found in the place, where the wood stood. And so, my lords, if you grant the
king these smaller monasteries, you do but make him a handle, whereby, at his
own pleasure, he may cut down all the cedars within your Lebanons." Dr. Bailie's

{#n61} There is a curious passage, with regard to the suppression of
monasteries, to be found in Coke's institutes, 4th Inst. chap. 1. p. 44. It is
worth transcribing, as it shews the ideas of the English government, entertained
during the reign of Henry VIII. and even in the time of Sir Edward Coke, when he
wrote his Institutes. It clearly appears, that the people had then little notion
of being jealous of their liberties, were desirous of making the crown quite
independent, and wished only to remove from themselves, as much as possible, the
burthens of government. A large standing army, and a fixed revenue, would, on
these conditions, have been regarded as great blessings; and it was owing
entirely to the prodigality of Henry, and to his little suspicion that the power
of the crown could ever fail, that the English owe all their present liberty.
The title of the chapter in Coke is, _Advice concerning new and plausible
Projects and Offers in Parliament._ "When any plausible project," says he, "is
made in parliament, to draw the lords and commons to assent to any act,
(especially in matters of weight and importance) if both houses do give upon the
matter projected and promised their consent, it shall be most necessary, they
being trusted for the commonwealth, to have the matter projected and promised
(which moved the houses to consent) to be established in the same act, lest the
benefit of the act be taken, and the matter projected and promised never
performed, and so the houses of parliament perform not the trust reposed in
them, as it fell out (taking one example for many) in the reign of Henry the
eighth: On the king's behalf, the members of both houses were informed in
parliament, that no king or kingdom was safe, but where the king had three
abilities; 1. To live of his own, and able to defend his kingdom upon any sudden
invasion or insurrection. 2. To aid his confederates, otherwise they would never
assist him. 3. To reward his well deserving servants. Now the project was, that
if the parliament would give unto him all the abbies, priories, friories,
nunneries, and other monasteries, that, for ever in time then to come, he would
take order that the same should not be converted to private uses: but first,
that his exchequer for the purposes aforesaid should be enriched; secondly, the
kingdom strengthened by a continual maintenance of forty thousand well- trained
soldiers, with skilful captains and commanders; thirdly, for the benefit and
ease of the subject, who never afterwards, (as was projected) in any time to
come, should be charged with subsidies, fifteenths, loans, or other common aids;
fourthly, lest the honour of the realm should receive any diminution of honour
by the dissolution of the said monasteries, there being twenty-nine lords of
parliament of the abbots and priors, (that held of the king _per_ _baronium,_
whereof more in the next leaf) that the king would create a number of nobles,
which we omit. The said monasteries were given to the king by authority of
divers acts of parliament, but no provision was therein made for the said
project, or any part thereof."
