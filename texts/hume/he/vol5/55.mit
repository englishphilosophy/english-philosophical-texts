{#1} THE Scots, who began these fatal commotions, thought, that they had
finished a very perilous undertaking, #1641.# much to their profit and
reputation. Besides the large pay voted them for lying in good quarters during a
twelvemonth, the English parliament had conferred on them a present of 300,000
pounds for their brotherly assistance[n1]. In the articles of pacification, they
were declared to have ever been good subjects; and their military expeditions
were approved of, as enterprizes calculated and intended for his majesty's
honour and advantage. To carry farther the triumph over their sovereign, these
terms, so ignominious to him, were ordered by a vote of parliament, to be read
in all churches, upon a day of thanksgiving, appointed for the national
pacification[n2]: All their claims for the restriction of prerogative, were
agreed to be |ratified: And what they more valued than all these advantages;
they had a near prospect of spreading the presbyterian discipline in England and
Ireland, from the seeds, which they had scattered, of their religious
principles. Never did refined Athens so exult in diffusing the sciences and
liberal arts over a savage world; never did generous Rome so please herself in
the view of law and order established by her victorious arms; as the Scots now
rejoiced, in communicating their barbarous zeal and theological fervour, to the
neighbouring nations.

{#2} #Aug. 14. Settlement of Scotland.# ^Charles^, despoiled in England of a
considerable part of his authority, and dreading still farther encroachments
upon him, arrived in Scotland, with an intention of abdicating almost entirely
the small share of power, which _there_ remained to him, and of giving full
satisfaction, if possible, to his restless subjects in that kingdom.

{#3} ^The^ lords of articles were an ancient institution in the Scottish
parliament. They were constituted after this manner. The temporal lords chose
eight bishops: The bishops elected eight temporal lords: These sixteen named
eight commissioners of counties, and eight burgesses: And without the previous
consent of the thirty-two, who were denominated lords of articles, no motion
could be made in parliament. As the bishops were entirely devoted to the court,
it is evident, that all the lords of articles, by necessary consequence,
depended on the king's nomination; and the prince, besides one negative after
the bills had passed through parliament, possessed indirectly another before
their introduction; a prerogative of much greater consequence than the former.
The bench of bishops being now abolished, the parliament laid hold of the
opportunity, and totally set aside the lords of articles: And till this
important point was obtained, the nation, properly speaking, could not be said
to enjoy any regular freedom[n3].

{#4} ^It^ is remarkable, that, notwithstanding this institution, to which there
was no parallel in England, the royal authority was always deemed much lower in
Scotland than in the former kingdom. Bacon represents it as one advantage to be
expected from the union, that the too extensive prerogative of England would be
abridged by the example of Scotland, and the too narrow prerogative |of Scotland
be enlarged from the imitation of England. The English were, at that time, a
civilized people, and obedient to the laws: But among the Scots, it was of
little consequence how the laws were framed, or by whom voted, while the
exorbitant aristocracy had it so much in their power to prevent their regular
execution.

{#5} ^The^ peers and commons formed only one house in the Scottish parliament:
And as it had been the practice of James, continued by Charles, to grace English
gentlemen with Scottish titles, all the determinations of parliament it was to
be feared, would in time depend upon the prince, by means of these votes of
foreigners, who had no interest or property in the nation. It was therefore a
law, deserving approbation, that no man should be created a Scotch peer, who
possessed not 10,000 marks (above 500 pounds) of annual rent in the kingdom[n4].

{#6} ^A^ law for triennial parliaments was likewise passed; and it was ordained,
that the last act of every parliament should be to appoint the time and place
for holding the parliament next ensuing[n5].

{#7} ^The^ king was deprived of that power, formerly exercised, of issuing
proclamations, which enjoined obedience, under the penalty of treason: A
prerogative, which invested him with the whole legislative authority, even in
matters of the highest importance[n6].

{#8} ^So^ far was laudable: But the most fatal blow given to royal authority,
and what in a manner dethroned the prince, was the article, that no member of
the privy council, in whose hands, during the king's absence, the whole
administration lay, no officer of state, none of the judges, should be appointed
but by advice and approbation of parliament. Charles even agreed to deprive of
their seats, four judges who had adhered to his interests; and their place was
supplied by others more agreeable to the ruling party. Several of the
covenanters were also sworn of the privy council. And all the ministers of
state, counsellors, and judges, were, by law, to hold their places during life
or good behaviour[n7].

{#9} ^The^ king, while in Scotland, conformed himself entirely to the
established church; and assisted with great gravity, at the long prayers and
longer sermons, with which the presbyterians endeavoured to regale him. He
bestowed pensions and preferments |on Henderson, Gillespy, and other popular
preachers; and practised every art to soften, if not to gain, his greatest
enemies. The earl of Argyle was created a marquis, lord Loudon an earl, Lesley
was dignified with the title of earl of Leven[n8]. His friends, he was obliged,
for the present, to neglect and overlook: Some of them were disgusted: And his
enemies were not reconciled; but ascribed all his caresses and favours to
artifice and necessity.

{#10} ^Argyle^ and Hamilton, being seized with an apprehension real or
pretended, that the earl of Crawfurd and others meant to assassinate them, left
the parliament suddenly, and retired into the country: But upon invitation and
assurances, returned in a few days. This event, which had neither cause nor
effect that was visible, nor purpose, nor consequence, was commonly denominated
the _incident._ But though the incident had no effect in Scotland; what was not
expected, it was attended with consequences in England. The English parliament,
which was now assembled, being willing to awaken the #October 20.# people's
tenderness by exciting their fears, immediately took the alarm; as if the
malignants, so they called the king's party, had laid a plot at once to murder
them and all the godly in both kingdoms. They applied, therefore, to Essex, whom
the king had left general in the south of England; and he ordered a guard to
attend them[n9].

{#11} ^But^ while the king was employed in pacifying the commotions in Scotland,
and was preparing to return to England, in order to apply himself to the same
salutary work in that kingdom; he received intelligence of a dangerous rebellion
broken out in Ireland, with circumstances of the utmost horror, bloodshed, and
devastation. On every side, this unfortunate prince was pursued with murmurs,
discontent, faction, and civil wars; and the fire, from all quarters, even by
the most independent accidents, at once blazed up about him.

{#12} ^The^ great plan of James, in the administration of Ireland, continued by
Charles, was, by justice and peace to reconcile that turbulent people to the
authority of laws, and, introducing art and industry among them, to cure them of
that sloth and barbarism, to which they had ever been subject. In order to serve
both these |purposes, and at the same time secure the dominion of Ireland to the
English crown, great colonies of British had been carried over, and, being
intermixed with the Irish, had every where introduced a new face of things into
that country. During a peace of near forty years, the inveterate quarrels
between the nations seemed, in a great measure, to be obliterated; and though
much of the landed property, forfeited by rebellion, had been conferred on the
new planters, a more than equal return had been made, by their instructing the
natives in tillage, building, manufactures, and all the civilized arts of
life[n10]. This had been the course of things during the successive
administrations of Chichester, Grandison, Falkland, and, above all, of
Strafford. Under the government of this latter nobleman, the pacific plans, now
come to greater maturity, and forwarded by his vigour and industry, seemed to
have operated with full success, and to have bestowed, at last, on that savage
country, the face of a European settlement.

{#13} ^After^ Strafford fell a victim to popular rage, the humours excited in
Ireland by that great event, could not suddenly be composed, but continued to
produce the greatest innovations in the government.

{#14} ^The^ British protestants, transplanted into Ireland, having, every moment
before their eyes, all the horrors of popery, had naturally been carried into
the opposite extreme, and had universally adopted the highest principles and
practices of the puritans. Monarchy, as well as the hierarchy, was become odious
to them; and every method of limiting the authority of the crown, and detaching
themselves from the king of England, was greedily adopted and pursued. They
considered not, that, as they scarcely-formed the sixth part of the people, and
were secretly obnoxious to the ancient inhabitants; their only method of
supporting themselves was by maintaining royal authority, and preserving a great
dependance on their mother-country. The English commons, likewise, in their
furious prosecution of Strafford, had overlooked the most obvious consequences;
and, while they imputed to him, as a crime, every discretionary act of
authority, they despoiled all succeeding governors of that power, by which alone
the Irish could be retained in subjection. And so strong was the current for
popular government |in all the three kingdoms, that the most established maxims
of policy were every where abandoned, in order to gratify this ruling passion.

{#15} ^Charles^, unable to resist, had been obliged to yield to the Irish, as to
the Scottish and English parliaments; and found too, that their encroachments
still rose in proportion to his concessions. Those subsidies, which themselves
had voted, they reduced, by a subsequent vote, to a fourth part: The court of
high commission was determined to be a grievance: Martial law abolished: The
jurisdiction of the council annihilated: Proclamations and acts of state
declared of no authority: Every order or institution, which depended on
monarchy, was invaded; and the prince was despoiled of all his prerogative,
without the least pretext of any violence or illegality in his administration.

{#16} ^The^ standing army of Ireland was usually about 3000 men; but in order to
assist the king in suppressing the Scottish covenanters, Strafford had raised
8000 more, and had incorporated with them a thousand men, drawn from the old
army; a necessary expedient for bestowing order and discipline on the new levied
soldiers. The private men in this army were all catholics; but the officers,
both commission and non-commission, were protestants, and could entirely be
depended on by Charles. The English commons entertained the greatest
apprehensions on account of this army; and never ceased soliciting the king,
till he agreed to break it: Nor would they consent to any proposal for
augmenting the standing army to 5000 men; a number which the king deemed
necessary for retaining Ireland in obedience.

{#17} ^Charles^, thinking it dangerous, that 8000 men accustomed to idleness,
and trained to the use of arms, should be dispersed among a nation so turbulent
and unsettled, agreed with the Spanish ambassador to have them transported into
Flanders, and enlisted in his master's service. The English commons, pretending
apprehensions, lest regular bodies of troops, disciplined in the Low Countries,
should prove still more dangerous, showed some aversion to this expedient; and
the king reduced his allowance to 4000 men. But when the Spaniards had hired
ships for transporting these troops, and the men were ready to embark; the
commons, willing to show their power, and not displeased with an opportunity of
curbing and affronting the king, prohibited every |one from furnishing vessels
for that service. And thus the project, formed by Charles, of freeing the
country from these men, was unfortunately disappointed[n11].

{#18} ^The^ old Irish remarked all these false steps of the English, and
resolved to take advantage of them. Tho' their animosity against that nation,
for want of an occasion to exert itself, seemed to be extinguished, it was only
composed into a temporary and deceitful tranquillity[n12]. Their interests, both
with regard to _property_ and _religion,_ secretly stimulated them to a revolt.
No individual of any sept, according to the ancient customs, had the property of
any particular estate; but as the whole sept had a title to a whole territory,
they ignorantly preferred this barbarous community before the more secure and
narrower possessions assigned them by the English. An indulgence, amounting
almost to a toleration, had been given to the catholic religion: But so long as
the churches and the ecclesiastical revenues were kept from the priests, and
they were obliged to endure the neighbourhood of profane heretics, being
themselves discontented, they continually endeavoured to retard any cordial
reconciliation between the English and the Irish nations.

{#19} #Conspiracy in Ireland.# ^There^ was a gentleman called Roger More, who,
though of a narrow fortune, was descended from an ancient Irish family, and was
much celebrated among his countrymen for valour and capacity. This man first
formed the project of expelling the English, and asserting the independency of
his native country[n13]. He secretly went from chieftain to chieftain, and
rouzed up every latent principle of discontent. He maintained a close
correspondence with lord Maguire and Sir Phelim ONeale, the most powerful of the
old Irish. By conversation, by letters, by his emissaries, he represented to his
countrymen the motives of a revolt. He observed to them, that, by the rebellion
of the Scots, and factions of the English, the king's authority in Britain was
reduced to so low a condition, that he never could exert himself with any
vigour, in maintaining the English dominion over Ireland; that the catholics, in
the Irish house of commons, assisted by the protestants, had so diminished the
royal prerogative and the power of the lieutenant, as would |much facilitate the
conducting, to its desired effect, any conspiracy or combination, which could be
formed; that the Scots having so successfully thrown off dependence on the crown
of England, and assumed the government into their own hands, had set an example
to the Irish, who had so much greater oppressions to complain of; that the
English planters, who had expelled them their possessions, suppressed their
religion, and bereaved them of their liberties, were but a handful in comparison
of the natives; that they lived in the most supine security, interspersed with
their numerous enemies, trusting to the protection of a small army, which was
itself scattered in inconsiderable divisions throughout the whole kingdom; that
a great body of men, disciplined by the government, were now thrown loose, and
were ready for any daring or desperate enterprize; that though the catholics had
hitherto enjoyed, in some tolerable measure, the exercise of their religion,
from the moderation of their indulgent prince, they must henceforth expect, that
the government will be conducted by other maxims and other principles; that the
puritanical parliament, having at length subdued their sovereign, would no
doubt, as soon as they had consolidated their authority, extend their ambitious
enterprizes to Ireland, and make the catholics in that kingdom feel the same
furious persecution, to which their brethren in England were at present exposed;
and that a revolt in the Irish, tending only to vindicate their native liberty
against the violence of foreign invaders, could never, at any time, be deemed
rebellion; much less during the present confusions, when their prince was, in a
manner, a prisoner, and obedience must be paid, not to him, but to those who had
traiterously usurped his lawful authority[n14].

{#20} ^By^ these considerations, More engaged all the heads of the native Irish
into the conspiracy. The English of the pale, as they were called, or the old
English planters, being all catholics, it was hoped, would afterwards join the
party, which restored their religion to its ancient splendor and authority. The
intention was, that Sir Phelim ONeale and the other conspirators should begin an
insurrection on one day, throughout the provinces, and should attack all the
English settlements; and that, on the same day, lord Maguire and Roger More
should surprize the castle of Dublin. The |commencement of the revolt was fixed
on the approach of winter; that there might be more difficulty in transporting
forces from England. Succours to themselves and supplies of arms they expected
from France, in consequence of a promise made them by cardinal Richelieu. And
many Irish officers, who served in the Spanish troops, had engaged to join them,
as soon as they saw an insurrection entered upon by their catholic brethren.
News, which every day arrived from England, of the fury expressed by the commons
against all papists, struck fresh terror into the Irish nation, and both
stimulated the conspirators to execute their fatal purpose, and gave them
assured hopes of the concurrence of all their countrymen[n15].

{#21} ^Such^ propensity to a revolt was discovered in all the Irish, that it was
deemed unnecessary, as it was dangerous, to entrust the secret to many hands;
and the appointed day drew nigh, nor had any discovery been yet made to the
government. The king, indeed, had received information from his ambassadors,
that something was in agitation among the Irish in foreign parts; but though he
gave warning to the administration in Ireland, the intelligence was entirely
neglected[n16]. Secret rumours, likewise, were heard of some approaching
conspiracy; but no attention was paid to them. The earl of Leicester, whom the
king had appointed lieutenant, remained in London. The two justices, Sir William
Parsons and Sir John Borlace, were men of small abilities; and, by an
inconvenience, common to all factious times, owed their advancement to nothing
but their zeal for the party, by whom every thing was now governed. Tranquil
from their ignorance and inexperience, these men indulged themselves in the most
profound repose, on the very brink of destruction.

{#22} ^But^ they were awakened from their security, on the very day before that
which was appointed for the commencement of hostilities. The castle of Dublin,
by which the capital was commanded, contained arms for 10,000 men, with
thirty-five pieces of cannon, and a proportionable quantity of ammunition: Yet
was this important place guarded, and that too without any care, by no greater
force than fifty men. Maguire and More were already in town with a numerous band
of their partizans: Others were expected |that night: And, next morning, they
were to enter upon, what they esteemed the easiest of all enterprizes, the
surprizal of the castle. Oconolly, an Irishman, but a protestant, betrayed the
conspiracy to Parsons[n17]. The justices and council fled immediately for
safety, into the castle, and re–inforced the guards. The alarm was conveyed to
the city, and all the protestants prepared for defence. More escaped: Maguire
was taken; and Mahone, one of the conspirators, being likewise seized, first
discovered to the justices, the project of a general insurrection, and redoubled
the apprehensions, which already were universally diffused throughout
Dublin[n18].

{#23} #Irish insurrection and massacre.# ^But^ though Oconolly's discovery saved
the castle from a surprize, the confession extorted from Mahone, came too late
to prevent the intended insurrection. ONeal and his confederates had already
taken arms in Ulster. The Irish, every where intermingled with the English,
needed but a hint from their leaders and priests to begin hostilities against a
people whom they hated on account of their religion, and envied for their riches
and prosperity[n19]. The houses, cattle, goods, of the unwary English were first
seized. Those, who heard of the commotions in their neighborhood, instead of
deserting their habitations, and assembling for mutual protection, remained at
home, in hopes of defending their property; and fell thus separately into the
hands of their enemies[n20]. After rapacity had fully exerted itself, cruelty,
and the most barbarous, that ever, in any nation, was known or heard of, begin
its operations. An universal massacre commenced of the English, now defenceless,
and passively resigned to their inhuman foes. No age, no sex, no condition was
spared. The wife weeping for her butchered husband, and embracing her helpless
children, was pierced with them, and perished by the same stroke[n21]. The old,
the young, the vigorous, the infirm, underwent a like fate, and were confounded
in one common ruin. In vain did flight save from the first assault: Destruction
was, every where, let loose, and met the hunted victims at every turn. In vain
was recourse had to relations, to companions, to friends: All connexions were
dissolved, and |death was dealt by that hand, from which protection was implored
and expected. Without provocation, without opposition, the astonished English,
living in profound peace, and full security, were massacred by their nearest
neighbours, with whom they had long upheld a continued intercourse of kindness
and good offices[n22].

{#24} ^But^ death was the lightest punishment, inflicted by those rebels: All
the tortures which wanton cruelty could devise, all the lingering pains of body,
the anguish of mind, the agonies of despair, could not satiate revenge excited
without injury, and cruelty derived from no cause. To enter into particulars
would shock the least delicate humanity. Such enormities, though attested by
undoubted evidence, appear almost incredible. Depraved nature, even perverted
religion, encouraged by the utmost licence, reach not to such a pitch of
ferocity; unless the pity, inherent in human breasts, be destroyed by that
contagion of example, which transports men beyond all the usual motives of
conduct and behaviour.

{#25} ^The^ weaker sex themselves, naturally tender to their own sufferings, and
compassionate to those of others, here emulated their more robust companions, in
the practice of every cruelty[n23]. Even children, taught by the example, and
encouraged by the exhortation, of their parents, essayed their feeble blows on
the dead carcasses of defenceless children of the English[n24]. The very avarice
of the Irish was not a sufficient restraint to their cruelty. Such was their
frenzy, that the cattle, which they had seized, and by rapine made their own,
yet, because they bore the name of English, were wantonly slaughtered, or, when
covered with wounds, turned loose into the woods or desarts[n25].

{#26} ^The^ stately buildings or commodious habitations of the planters, as if
upbraiding the sloth and ignorance of the natives, were consumed with fire, or
laid level with the ground. And where the miserable owners, shut up in their
houses, and preparing for defence, perished in the flames, together with their
wives and children, a double triumph was afforded to their insulting foes[n26].

{#27} ^If^ any where a number assembled together, and, assuming courage from
despair, were resolved to sweeten death by revenge |on their assassins; they
were disarmed by capitulations, and promises of safety, confirmed by the most
solemn oaths. But no sooner had they surrendered, than the rebels, with perfidy
equal to their cruelty, made them share the fate of their unhappy
countrymen[n27].

{#28} ^Others^, more ingenious still in their barbarity, tempted their
prisoners, by the fond love of life, to embrue their hands in the blood of
friends, brothers, parents; and having thus rendered them accomplices in guilt,
gave them that death, which they sought to shun by deserving it[n28].

{#29} ^Amidst^ all these enormities, the sacred name of Religion resounded on
every side; not to stop the hands of these murderers, but to enforce their
blows, and to steel their hearts against every movement of human or social
sympathy. The English, as heretics, abhorred of God, and detestable to all holy
men, were marked out by the priests for slaughter; and, of all actions, to rid
the world of these declared enemies to catholic faith and piety, was represented
as the most meritorious[n29]. Nature, which, in that rude people, was
sufficiently inclined to atrocious deeds, was farther stimulated by precept; and
national prejudices empoisoned by those aversions, more deadly and incurable,
which arose from an enraged superstition. While death finished the sufferings of
each victim, the bigotted assassins, with joy and exultation, still echoed in
his expiring ears, that these agonies were but the commencement of torments,
infinite and eternal[n30].

{#30} ^Such^ were the barbarities, by which Sir Phelim ONeale and the Irish in
Ulster signalized their rebellion: An event, memorable in the annals of human
kind, and worthy to be held in perpetual detestation and abhorrence. The
generous nature of More was shocked at the recital of such enormous cruelties.
He flew to ONeale's camp; but found, that his authority, which was sufficient to
excite the Irish to an insurrection, was too feeble to restrain their
inhumanity. Soon after, he abandoned a cause, polluted by so many crimes; and he
retired into Flanders. Sir Phelim, recommended by the greatness of his family,
and perhaps too, by the unrestrained brutality of his nature, though without any
courage or capacity, acquired the entire ascendant over the northern
rebels[n31]. |The English colonies were totally annihilated in the open country
of Ulster: The Scots, at first, met with more favourable treatment. In order to
engage them to a passive neutrality, the Irish pretended to distinguish between
the British nations; and claiming friendship and consanguinity with the Scots,
extended not over them the fury of their massacres. Many of them found an
opportunity to fly the country: Others retired into places of security, and
prepared themselves for defence: And by this means, the Scottish planters, most
of them at least, escaped with their lives[n32].

{#31} ^From^ Ulster, the flames of rebellion diffused themselves, in an instant,
over the other three provinces of Ireland. In all places death and slaughter
were not uncommon; though the Irish, in these other provinces, pretended to act
with moderation and humanity. But cruel and barbarous was their humanity! Not
content with expelling the English their houses, with despoiling them of their
goodly manors, with wasting their cultivated fields; they stripped them of their
very cloaths, and turned them out, naked and defenceless, to all the severities
of the season[n33]. The heavens themselves, as if conspiring against that
unhappy people were armed with cold and tempest, unusual to the climate, and
executed what the merciless sword had left unfinished[n34]. The roads were
covered with crowds of naked English, hastening towards Dublin and the other
cities, which yet remained in the hands of their countrymen. The feeble age of
children, the tender sex of women, soon sunk under the multiplied rigours of
cold and hunger. Here, the husband, bidding a final adieu to his expiring
family, envied them for fate, which he himself expected so soon to share: There,
the son, having long supported his aged parent, with reluctance obeyed his last
commands, and abandoning him in this uttermost distress, reserved himself to the
hopes of avenging that death, which all his efforts could not prevent or delay.
The astonishing greatness of the calamity deprived the sufferers of any relief
from the view of companions in affliction. With silent tears, or lamentable
cries, they hurried on through the hostile territories; and found every heart,
which was not steeled by native barbarity, |guarded by the more implacable
furies of mistaken piety and religion[n35].

{#32} ^The^ saving of Dublin preserved in Ireland the remains of the English
name. The gates of that city, though timorously opened, received the wretched
supplicants, and presented to the view a scene of human misery, beyond what any
eye had ever before beheld[n36]. Compassion seized the amazed inhabitants,
aggravated with the fear of like calamities; while they observed the numerous
foes, without and within, which every where environed them, and reflected on the
weak resources, by which they were themselves supported. The more vigorous of
the unhappy fugitives, to the number of three thousand, were inlisted into three
regiments: The rest were distributed into the houses; and all care was taken, by
diet and warmth, to recruit their feeble and torpid limbs. Diseases of unknown
name and species, derived from these multiplied distresses, seized many of them,
and put a speedy period to their lives: Others, having now leisure to reflect on
their mighty loss of friends and fortune, cursed that being which they had
saved. Abandoning themselves to despair, refusing all succour, they expired;
without other consolation, than that of receiving among their countrymen, the
honours of a grave, which, to their slaughtered companions, had been denied by
the inhuman barbarians[n37].

{#33} ^By^ some computations, those, who perished by all these cruelties, are
supposed to be a hundred and fifty, or two hundred thousand: By the most
moderate, and probably the most reasonable account, they are made to amount to
40,000; if this estimation itself be not, as is usual in such cases, somewhat
exaggerated.

{#34} ^The^ justices ordered to Dublin all the bodies of the army, which were
not surrounded by the rebels; and they assembled a force of 1500 veterans. They
soon inlisted, and armed from the magazines above 4000 men more. They dispatched
a body of 600 men to throw relief into Tredah, besieged by the Irish. But these
troops, attacked by the enemy, were seized with a panic, and were most of them
put to the sword. Their arms, falling into the hands of the Irish, supplied them
with what they most wanted[n38]. The justices, willing to foment the rebellion,
in a view of profiting by the multiplyed |forfeitures, henceforth thought of
nothing more than providing for their own present security and that of the
capital. The earl of Ormond, their general, remonstrated against such timid, not
to say, base and interested counsels; but was obliged to submit to authority.

{#35} ^The^ English of the pale, who probably were not, at first, in the secret,
pretended to blame the insurrection, and to detest the barbarity, with which it
was accompanied[n39]. By their protestations and declarations, they engaged the
justices to supply them with arms, which they promised to employ in defence of
the government[n40]. But in a little time, the interests of religion were found
more prevalent over them than regard and duty to their mother country. They
chose lord Gormanstone their leader; and, joining the old Irish, rivaled them in
every act of violence towards the English protestants. Besides many smaller
bodies, dispersed over the kingdom, the principal army of the rebels amounted to
twenty thousand men, and threatened Dublin with an immediate siege[n41].

{#36} ^Both^ the English and Irish rebels conspired in one imposture, with which
they seduced many of their deluded countrymen: They pretended authority from the
king and queen, but chiefly from the latter, for their insurrection; and they
affirmed, that the cause of their taking arms was to vindicate royal
prerogative, now invaded by the puritanical parliament[n42]. Sir Phelim ONeale,
having found a royal patent in lord Caufield's house, whom he had murdered, tore
off the seal, and affixed it to a commission, which he had forged for
himself[n43].

{#37} ^The^ king received an account of this insurrection by a messenger,
dispatched from the north of Ireland. He immediately communicated his
intelligence to the Scottish parliament. He expected, that the mighty zeal,
expressed by the Scots for the protestant religion, would immediately engage
them to fly to its defence, where it was so violently invaded: He hoped, that
their horror against popery, a religion, which now appeared in its most horrible
aspect, would second all his exhortations: He had observed with what alacrity
they had twice run to arms, and assembled |troops in opposition to the rights of
their sovereign: He saw with how much greater facility they could now collect
forces, which had been very lately disbanded, and which had been so long enured
to military discipline. The cries of their affrighted and distressed brethren in
Ireland, he promised himself, would powerfully incite them to send over
succours, which could arrive so quickly, and aid them with such promptitude in
this uttermost distress. But the zeal of the Scots, as is usual among religious
sects, was very feeble, when not stimulated either by faction or by interest.
They now considered themselves entirely as a republic, and made no account of
the authority of their prince, which they had utterly annihilated. Conceiving
hopes from the present distresses of Ireland, they resolved to make an
advantageous bargain for the succours, with which they should supply their
neighbouring nation. And they cast their eye towards the English parliament,
with whom they were already so closely connected, and who could alone fulfil any
articles, which might be agreed on. Except dispatching a small body to support
the Scottish colonies in Ulster, they would, therefore, go no farther at
present, than sending commissioners to London, in order to treat with that
power, to whom the sovereign authority was now in reality transferred[n44].

{#38} ^The^ king too, sensible of his utter inability to subdue the Irish
rebels, found himself obliged, in this exigency, to have recourse to the English
parliament, and depend on their assistance for supply. After communicating to
them the intelligence, which he had received, he informed them, that the
insurrection was not, in his opinion, the result of any rash enterprize, but of
a formed conspiracy against the crown of England. To their care and wisdom,
therefore, he said, he committed the conduct and prosecution of the war, which,
in a cause so important to national and religious interests, must of necessity
be immediately entered upon, and vigorously pursued[n45].

{#39} #Meeting of the English parliament.# ^The^ English parliament was now
assembled; and discovered, in every vote, the same dispositions, in which they
had separated. The exalting of their own authority, the diminishing of the
king's, were still the objects pursued by the majority. Every attempt, which had
been made to gain the popular leaders, and by offices |to attach them to the
crown, had failed of success, either for want of skill in conducting it, or by
reason of the slender preferments, which it was then in the king's power to
confer. The ambitious and enterprising patriots disdained to accept, in detail,
of a precarious power; while they deemed it so easy, by one bold and vigorous
assault, to possess themselves for ever of the entire sovereignty. Sensible that
the measures, which they had hitherto pursued, rendered them extremely obnoxious
to the king; were many of them in themselves exceptionable; some of them,
strictly speaking, illegal; they resolved to seek their own security, as well as
greatness, by enlarging popular authority in England. The great necessities, to
which the king was reduced; the violent prejudices, which generally, throughout
the nation, prevailed against him; his facility in making the most important
concessions; the example of the Scots, whose encroachments had totally subverted
monarchy: All these circumstances farther instigated the commons in their
invasion of royal prerogative. And the danger, to which the constitution seemed
to have been so lately exposed, persuaded many, that it never could be
sufficiently secured, but by the entire abolition of that authority, which had
invaded it.

{#40} ^But^ this project, it had not been in the power, scarcely in the
intention, of the popular leaders to execute, had it not been for the passion,
which seized the nation for presbyterian discipline, and for the wild
enthusiasm, which at that time accompanied it. The licence, which the parliament
had bestowed on this spirit, by checking ecclesiastical authority; the
countenance and encouragement, with which they had honoured it; had already
diffused its influence to a wonderful degree: And all orders of men had drunk
deep of the intoxicating poison. In every discourse or conversation, this mode
of religion entered; in all business, it had a share; every elegant pleasure or
amusement, it utterly annihilated; many vices or corruptions of mind, it
promoted; even diseases and bodily distempers were not totally exempted from it;
and it became requisite, we are told, for all physicians to be expert in the
spiritual profession, and, by theological consideration, to allay those
religious terrors, with which their patients were so generally haunted. Learning
itself, which tends so much to enlarge the mind, and humanize the temper, rather
served on this occasion to exalt that epidemical frenzy which prevailed. Rude as
yet, and imperfect, it |supplied the dismal fanaticism with a variety of views,
founded it on some coherency of system, enriched it with different figures of
elocution; advantages with which a people, totally ignorant and barbarous, had
been happily unacquainted.

{#41} ^From^ policy, at first, and inclination, now from necessity, the king
attached himself extremely to the hierarchy: For like reasons, his enemies were
determined, by one and the same effort, to overpower the church and monarchy.

{#42} ^While^ the commons were in this disposition, the Irish rebellion was the
event, which tended most to promote the views, in which all their measures
terminated. A horror against the papists, however innocent, they had constantly
encouraged; a terror from the conspiracies of that sect, however improbable,
they had at all times endeavoured to excite. Here was broken out a rebellion,
dreadful and unexpected; accompanied with circumstances the most detestable, of
which there ever was any record; And what was the peculiar guilt of the Irish
catholics, it was no difficult matter, in the present disposition of men's
minds, to attribute to that whole sect, who were already so much the object of
general abhorrence. Accustomed, in all invectives, to join the prelatical party
with the papists, the people immediately supposed this insurrection to be the
result of their united counsels. And when they heard, that the Irish rebels
pleaded the king's commission for all their acts of violence; bigotry, ever
credulous and malignant, assented without scruple to that gross imposture, and
loaded the unhappy prince with the whole enormity of a contrivance so barbarous
and inhuman[n46].

{#43} ^By^ the difficulties and distresses of the crown, the commons, who
possessed alone the power of supply, had aggrandized themselves; and it seemed a
peculiar happiness, that the Irish rebellion had succeeded, at so critical a
juncture, to the pacification of Scotland. That expression of the king's, by
which he committed to them the care of Ireland, they immediately laid hold of,
and interpreted in the most unlimited sense. They had, on other occasions, been
gradually encroaching on the executive power of the crown, which forms its
principal and most natural branch of authority; but, with regard to Ireland,
they at once assumed it, fully and |entirely, as if delivered over to them by a
regular gift or assignment. And to this usurpation the king was obliged
passively to submit; both because of his inability to resist, and lest he should
still more expose himself to the reproach of favouring the progress of that
odious rebellion.

{#44} ^The^ project of introducing farther innovations in England being once
formed by the leaders among the commons, it became a necessary consequence, that
their operations with regard to Ireland should, all of them, be considered as
subordinate to the former, on whose success, when once undertaken, their own
grandeur, security, and even being, must entirely depend. While they pretended
the utmost zeal against the Irish insurrection, they took no steps towards its
suppression, but such as likewise tended to give them the superiority in those
commotions, which, they foresaw, must so soon be excited in England[n47]. The
extreme contempt, entertained for the natives in Ireland, made the popular
leaders believe, that it would be easy at any time to suppress their rebellion,
and recover that kingdom: Nor were they willing to lose, by too hasty success,
the advantage, which that rebellion would afford them in their projected
encroachments on the prerogative. By assuming the total management of the war,
they acquired the courtship and dependence of every one, who had any connexion
with Ireland, or who was desirous of inlisting in these military enterprizes:
They levied money under pretence of the Irish expedition; but reserved it for
purposes, which concerned them more nearly: They took arms from the king's
magazines; but still kept them with a secret intention of employing them against
himself: Whatever law they deemed necessary for aggrandizing themselves, was
voted, under colour of enabling them to recover Ireland; and if Charles
with-held the royal assent, his refusal was imputed to those pernicious
counsels, which had at first excited the popish rebellion, and which still
threatened total destruction to the protestant interest throughout all his
dominions[n48]. And though no forces were for a long time sent over to Ireland,
and very little money remitted, during the extreme distress of that kingdom; so
strong was the people's attachment to the commons, that the fault |was never
imputed to those pious zealots, whose votes breathed nothing but death and
destruction to the Irish rebels.

{#45} ^To^ make the attack on royal authority by regular approaches, it was
thought proper to frame a general remonstrance of the state of the nation; and
accordingly the committee, which, at the first meeting of parliament, had been
chosen for that purpose, and which had hitherto made no progress in their work,
received fresh injunctions to finish that undertaking.

{#46} #The remonstrance.# ^The^ committee brought into the house that
remonstrance, which has become so memorable, and which was soon afterwards
attended with such important consequences. It was not addressed to the king; but
was openly declared to be an appeal to the people. The harshness of the matter
was equalled by the severity of the language. It consists of many gross
falsehoods, intermingled with some evident truths: Malignant insinuations are
joined to open invectives: Loud complaints of the past, accompanied with jealous
prognostications of the future. Whatever unfortunate, whatever invidious,
whatever suspicious measure, had been embraced by the king from the commencement
of his reign, is insisted on and aggravated with merciless rhetoric: The
unsuccessful expeditions to Cadiz and the isle of Rhé, are mentioned: The
sending of ships to France for the suppression of the hugonots: The forced
loans: The illegal confinement of men for not obeying illegal commands: The
violent dissolution of four parliaments: The arbitrary government which always
succeeded: The questioning, fining, and imprisoning of members for their conduct
in the house: The levying of taxes without consent of the commons: The
introducing of superstitious innovations into the church, without authority of
law: In short, every thing, which, either with or without reason, had given
offence, during the course of fifteen years, from the accession of the king to
the calling of the present parliament. And, though all these grievances had been
already redressed, and even laws enacted for future security against their
return, the praise of these advantages was ascribed, not to the king, but to the
parliament, who had extorted his consent to such salutary statutes. Their own
merits too, they asserted, towards the king, were no less eminent, than towards
the people. Though they had seized his whole revenue, rendered it totally
precarious, and made even their temporary supplies be paid to their own
commissioners, who were |independent of him; they pretended, that they had
liberally supported him in his necessities. By an insult still more egregious,
the very giving of money to the Scots, for levying war against their sovereign,
they represented as an instance of their duty towards him. And all their
grievances, they said, which amounted to no less than a total subversion of the
constitution, proceeded entirely from the formed combination of a popish
faction, who had ever swayed the king's counsels, who had endeavoured, by an
uninterrupted effort, to introduce their superstition into England and Scotland,
and who had now, at last, excited an open and bloody rebellion in Ireland[n49].

{#47} ^This^ remonstrance, so full of acrimony and violence, was a plain signal
for some farther attacks intended on royal prerogative, and a declaration, that
the concessions, already made, however important, were not to be regarded as
satisfactory. What pretensions would be advanced, how unprecedented, how
unlimited, were easily imagined; and nothing less was foreseen, whatever ancient
names might be preserved, than an abolition, almost total, of the monarchical
government of England. The opposition, therefore, which the remonstrance met
with in the house of commons, was great. For above fourteen hours, the debate
was warmly managed; and from the weariness of the king's party, which probably
consisted chiefly of the elderly people, and men of cool spirits, the vote was
at last carried by a small majority of eleven[n50]. #22nd Nov.# Some time after,
the remonstrance was ordered to be printed and published, without being carried
up to the house of peers, for their assent and concurrence.

{#48} #Reasons on both sides.# ^When^ this remonstrance was dispersed, it
excited every-where the same violent controversy, which attended it when
introduced into the house of commons. This parliament, said the partizans of
that assembly, have at length profited by the fatal example of their
predecessors; and are resolved, that the fabric, which they have generously
undertaken to rear for the protection of liberty, shall not be left to future
ages insecure and imperfect. At the time when the petition of right, that
requisite vindication of a violated constitution, was extorted from the
unwilling prince; who but imagined, |that liberty was at last secured, and that
the laws would thenceforth maintain themselves in opposition to arbitrary
authority? But what was the event? A _right_ was indeed acquired to the people,
or rather their ancient right was more exactly defined: But as the _power_ of
invading it still remained in the prince, no sooner did an opportunity offer,
than he totally disregarded all laws and preceding engagements, and made his
will and pleasure the sole rule of government. Those lofty ideas of monarchical
authority, which he has derived from his early education, which are united in
his mind with the irresistible illusions of self-love, which are corroborated by
his mistaken principles of religion, it is in vain to hope, that, in his more
advanced age, he will sincerely renounce, from any subsequent reflection or
experience. Such conversions, if ever they happen, are extremely rare; but to
expect, that they will be derived from necessity, from the jealousy and
resentment of antagonists, from blame, from reproach, from opposition, must be
the result of the fondest and most blind credulity. These violences, however
necessary, are sure to irritate a prince against limitations so cruelly imposed
upon him; and each concession, which he is constrained to make, is regarded as a
temporary tribute paid to faction and sedition, and is secretly attended with a
resolution of seizing every favourable opportunity to retract it. Nor should we
imagine, that opportunities of that kind will not offer in the course of human
affairs. Governments, especially those of a mixed kind, are in continual
fluctuation: The humours of the people change perpetually from one extreme to
another: And no resolution can be more wise, as well as more just, than that of
employing the present advantages against the king, who had formerly pushed much
less tempting ones to the utmost extremities against his people and his
parliament. It is to be feared, that, if the religious rage, which has seized
the multitude, be allowed to evaporate, they will quickly return to the ancient
ecclesiastical establishment; and, with it, embrace those principles of slavery,
which it inculcates with such zeal on its submissive proselytes. Those patriots,
who are now the public idols, may then become the objects of general
detestation; and equal shouts of joy attend their ignominious execution, with
those which second their present advantages and triumphs. Nor ought the
apprehension of such an event to be regarded in them as a selfish consideration:
In their safety is involved the security of the laws: |The patrons of the
constitution cannot suffer without a fatal blow to the constitution: And it is
but justice in the public to protect, at any hazard, those who have so
generously exposed themselves to the utmost hazard for the public interest. What
though monarchy, the ancient government of England, be impaired, during these
contests, in many of its former prerogatives: The laws will flourish the more by
its decay; and it is happy, allowing that matters are really carried beyond the
bounds of moderation, that the current at least runs towards liberty, and that
the error is on that side, which is safest for the general interests of mankind
and society.

{#49} ^The^ best arguments of the royalists against a farther attack on the
prerogative were founded more on opposite ideas, which they had formed of the
past events of this reign, than on opposite principles of government. Some
invasions, they said, and those too of moment, had undoubtedly been made on
national privileges: But were we to look for the cause of these violences, we
should never find it to consist in the wanton tyranny and injustice of the
prince, not even in his ambition or immoderate appetite for authority. The
hostilities with Spain, in which the king, on his accession, found himself
engaged, however imprudent and unnecessary, had proceeded from the advice, and
even importunity of the parliament; who deserted him immediately after they had
embarked him in those warlike measures. A young prince, jealous of honour, was
naturally afraid of being soiled in his first enterprize, and had not as yet
attained such maturity of counsel, as to perceive that his greatest honour lay
in preserving the laws inviolate, and gaining the full confidence of his people.
The rigour of the subsequent parliaments had been extreme with regard to many
articles, particularly tonnage and poundage; and had reduced the king to an
absolute necessity, if he would preserve entire the royal prerogative, of
levying those duties by his own authority, and of breaking through the forms, in
order to maintain the spirit, of the constitution. Having once made so perilous
a step, he was naturally induced to continue, and to consult the public
interest, by imposing ship-money, and other moderate, though irregular, burthens
and taxations. A sure proof, that he had formed no system for enslaving his
people is, that the chief object of his government has been to raise a naval,
not a military force; a project useful, honourable, nay indispensibly requisite,
and in spite of his great |necessities, brought almost to a happy conclusion. It
is now full time to free him from all these necessities, and to apply cordials
and lenitives, after those severities, which have already had their full course
against him. Never was sovereign blessed with more moderation of temper, with
more justice, more humanity, more honour, or a more gentle disposition. What
pity that such a prince should so long have been harassed with rigours,
suspicions, calumnies, complaints, incroachments; and been forced from that
path, in which the rectitude of his principles would have inclined him to have
constantly trod! If some few instances are found of violations made on the
petition of right, which he himself had granted; there is an easier and more
natural way for preventing the return of like inconveniencies, than by a total
abolition of royal authority. Let the revenue be settled, suitably to the
ancient dignity and splendor of the crown; let the public necessities be fully
supplied; let the remaining articles of prerogative be left untouched; and the
king, as he has already lost the power, will lay aside the will, of invading the
constitution. From what quarter can jealousies now arise? What farther security
can be desired or expected? The king's preceding concessions, so far from being
insufficient for public security, have rather erred on the other extreme; and,
by depriving him of all power of self-defence, are the real cause why the
commons are emboldened to raise pretensions hitherto unheard of in the kingdom,
and to subvert the whole system of the constitution. But would they be content
with moderate advantages, is it not evident, that, besides other important
concessions, the present parliament may be continued, till the government be
accustomed to the new track, and every part be restored to full harmony and
concord? By the triennial act a perpetual succession of parliaments is
established, as everlasting guardians to the laws, while the king possesses no
independent power or military force, by which he can be supported in his
invasion of them. No danger remains, but what is inseparable from all free
constitutions, and what forms the very essence of their freedom: The danger of a
change in the people's disposition, and of general disgust, contracted against
popular privileges. To prevent such an evil, no expedient is more proper, than
to contain ourselves within the bounds of moderation, and to consider, that all
extremes, naturally and infallibly, beget each other. In the same manner as the
past usurpations of the crown, |however excusable on account of the necessity or
provocations whence they arose, have excited an immeasurable appetite for
liberty; let us beware, lest our encroachments, by introducing anarchy, make the
people seek shelter under the peaceable and despotic rule of a monarch.
Authority, as well as liberty, is requisite to government; and is even requisite
to the support of liberty itself, by maintaining the laws, which can alone
regulate and protect it. What madness, while every thing is so happily settled
under ancient forms and institutions, now more exactly poised and adjusted, to
try the hazardous experiment of a new constitution, and renounce the mature
wisdom of our ancestors for the crude whimsies of turbulent innovators! Besides
the certain and inconceivable mischiefs of civil war; are not the perils
apparent, which the delicate frame of liberty must inevitably sustain amidst the
furious shock of arms? Whichever side prevails, _she_ can scarcely hope to
remain inviolate, and may suffer no less, or rather greater injuries from the
boundless pretensions of forces engaged in her cause, than from the invasion of
enraged troops, inlisted on the side of monarchy.

{#50} #Nov. 25.# ^The^ king, upon his return from Scotland, was received in
London with the shouts and acclamations of the people, and with every
demonstration of regard and affection[n51]. Sir Richard Gournay, lord mayor, a
man of moderation and authority, had promoted these favourable dispositions, and
had engaged the populace, who so lately insulted the king, and who so soon after
made furious war upon him, to give him these marks of their dutiful attachment.
But all the pleasure, which Charles reaped from this joyous reception, was soon
damped by the remonstrance of the commons, which was presented him, together
with a petition of a like strain. The bad counsels, which he followed, are there
complained of; his concurrence in the Irish rebellion plainly insinuated; the
scheme, laid for the introduction of popery and superstition, inveighed against;
and, as a remedy for all these evils, he is desired to entrust every office and
command to persons, in whom his parliament should have cause to confide[n52]. By
this phrase, which is so often repeated in all the memorials and addresses of
that time, the commons meant themselves and their adherents.

{#51} ^As^ soon as the remonstrance of the commons was published, |the king
dispersed an answer to it. In this contest, he lay under great disadvantages.
Not only the ears of the people were extremely prejudiced against him; the best
topics, upon which he could justify, at least apologize for his former conduct,
were such as it was not safe or prudent for him at this time to employ. So high
was the national idolatry towards parliaments, that to blame the past conduct of
these assemblies, would have been very ill received by the generality of the
people. So loud were the complaints against regal usurpations, that, had the
king asserted the prerogative of supplying, by his own authority, the
deficiencies in government, arising from the obstinacy of the commons, he would
have encreased the clamours, with which the whole nation already resounded.
Charles, therefore, contented himself, with observing, in general, that even
during that period, so much complained of, the people enjoyed a great measure of
happiness, not only comparatively, in respect of their neighbours, but even in
respect of those times, which were justly accounted the most fortunate. He made
warm protestations of sincerity in the reformed religion; he promised indulgence
to tender consciences with regard to the ceremonies of the church; he mentioned
his great concessions to national liberty; he blamed the infamous libels
every-where dispersed against his person and the national religion; he
complained of the general reproaches thrown out in the remonstrance, with regard
to ill counsels, though he had protected no minister from parliamentary justice,
retained no unpopular servant, and conferred offices on no one, who enjoyed not
a high character and estimation in the public. "If, notwithstanding this," he
adds, "any malignant party shall take heart, and be willing to sacrifice the
peace and happiness of their country to their own sinister ends and ambition,
under whatever pretence of religion and conscience; if they shall endeavour to
lessen my reputation and interest, and to weaken my lawful power and authority;
if they shall attempt, by discountenancing the present laws, to loosen the bands
of government, that all disorder and confusion may break in upon us; I doubt not
but God, in his good time, will discover them to me, and that the wisdom and
courage of my high court of parliament will join with me in their suppression
and punishment."[n53] Nothing shows more evidently the hard situation, in which
Charles was |placed, than to observe, that he was obliged to confine himself
within the limits of civility towards subjects, who had transgressed all bounds
of regard, and even of good manners, in the treatment of their sovereign.

{#52} ^The^ first instance of those parliamentary encroachments, which Charles
was now to look for, was, the bill for pressing soldiers to the service of
Ireland. This bill quickly passed the lower house. In the preamble, the king's
power of pressing, a power exercised during all former times, was declared
illegal, and contrary to the liberty of the subject. By a necessary consequence,
the prerogative, which the crown had ever assumed, of obliging men to accept of
any branch of public service, was abolished and annihilated: A prerogative, it
must be owned, not very compatible with a limited monarchy. In order to elude
this law, the king offered to raise 10,000 volunteers for the Irish service: But
the commons were afraid lest such an army should be too much at his devotion.
Charles, still unwilling to submit to so considerable a diminution of power,
came to the house of peers, and offered to pass the law without the preamble; by
which means, he said, that ill-timed question with regard to the prerogative
would for the present be avoided, and the pretensions of each party be left
entire. Both houses took fire at this measure, which, from a similar instance,
while the bill of attainder against Strafford was in dependence, Charles might
foresee, would be received with resentment. The lords, as well as commons,
passed a vote, declaring it to be a high breach of privilege for the king to
take notice of any bill, which was in agitation in either of the houses, or to
express his sentiments with regard to it, before it be presented to him for his
assent in a parliamentary manner. The king was obliged to compose all matters by
an apology[n54].

{#53} ^The^ general question, we may observe, with regard to privileges of
parliament, has always been, and still continues, one of the greatest mysteries
in the English constitution; and, in some respects, notwithstanding the accurate
genius of that government, these privileges are at present as undetermined as
were formerly the prerogatives of the crown. Such privileges as are founded on
|long precedent cannot be controverted: But though it were certain, that former
kings had not in any instance taken notice of bills lying before the houses
(which yet appears to have been very common) it follows not, merely from their
never exerting such a power, that they had renounced it, or never were possessed
of it. Such privileges also as are essential to all free assemblies which
deliberate, they may be allowed to assume, whatever precedents may prevail: But
though the king's interposition, by an offer or advice, does in some degree
overawe or restrain liberty; it may be doubted, whether it imposes such evident
violence as to entitle the parliament, without any other authority or
concession, to claim the privilege of excluding it. But this was the favourable
time for extending privileges; and had none more exorbitant or unreasonable been
challenged, few bad consequences had followed. The establishment of this rule,
it is certain, contributes to the order and regularity, as well as freedom, of
parliamentary proceedings.

{#54} ^The^ interposition of peers in the election of commoners was likewise
about this time declared a breach of privilege; and continues ever since to be
condemned by votes of the commons, and universally practiced throughout the
nation.

{#55} ^Every^ measure pursued by the commons, and, still more, every attempt
made by their partizans, were full of the most inveterate hatred against the
hierarchy, and showed a determined resolution of subverting the whole
ecclesiastical establishment. Besides numberless vexations and persecutions,
which the clergy underwent from the arbitrary power of the lower house; the
peers, while the king was in Scotland, having passed an order for the observance
of the laws with regard to public worship, the commons assumed such authority,
that, by a vote alone of their house, they suspended those laws, though enacted
by the whole legislature: And they particularly forbade bowing at the name of
Jesus; a practice which gave them the highest scandal, and which was one of
their capital objections against the established religion[n55]. They complained
of the king's filling five vacant sees, and considered it as an insult upon
them, that he should complete and strengthen an order, which they intended soon
entirely to abolish[n56]. They had accused |thirteen bishops of high treason,
for enacting canons without consent of parliament[n57], though, from the
foundation of the monarchy, no other method had ever been practised: And they
now insisted, that the peers, upon this general accusation, should sequester
those bishops from their seats in parliament, and commit them to prison. Their
bill for taking away the bishops' votes had last winter been rejected by the
peers: But they again introduced the same bill, though no prorogation had
intervened; and they endeavoured, by some minute alterations, to elude that rule
of parliament, which opposed them. And when they sent up this bill to the lords,
they made a demand, the most absurd in the world, that the bishops, being all of
them parties, should be refused a vote with regard to that question[n58]. After
the resolution was once formed by the commons, of invading the established
government of church and state, it could not be expected, that their
proceedings, in such a violent attempt, would thenceforth be altogether regular
and equitable: But it must be confessed, that, in their attack on the hierarchy,
they still more openly passed all bounds of moderation; as supposing, no doubt,
that the sacredness of the cause would sufficiently atone for employing means
the most irregular and unprecedented. This principle, which prevails so much
among zealots, never displayed itself so openly as during the transactions of
this whole period.

{#56} ^But^, notwithstanding these efforts of the commons, they could not expect
the concurrence of the upper house, either to this law, or to any other, which
they should introduce for the farther limitation of royal authority. The
majority of the peers adhered to the king, and plainly foresaw the depression of
nobility, as a necessary consequence of popular usurpations on the crown. The
insolence, indeed, of the commons, and their haughty treatment of the lords, had
already risen to a great height, and gave sufficient warning to their future
attempts upon that order. They muttered somewhat of their regret that they
should be obliged to save the kingdom alone, and that the house of peers would
have no part in the honour. Nay, they went so far as openly to tell the lords,
"That they themselves were the representative body of the whole kingdom, and
that the peers were nothing but individuals, who held their seats in a
particular capacity: And therefore, if their lordships will |not consent to the
passing of acts necessary for the preservation of the people, the commons,
together with such of the lords as are more sensible of the danger, must join
together, and represent the matter to his majesty."[n59] So violent was the
democratical, enthusiastic spirit diffused throughout the nation, that a total
confusion of all rank and order was justly to be apprehended; and the wonder was
not, that the majority of the nobles should seek shelter under the throne, but
that any of them should venture to desert it. But the tide of popularity seized
many, and carried them wide of the most established maxims of civil policy.
Among the opponents of the king are ranked the earl of Northumberland, lord
admiral, a man of the first family and fortune, and endowed with that dignified
pride, which so well became his rank and station: The earl of Essex, who
inherited all his father's popularity, and having, from his early youth, sought
renown in arms, united to a middling capacity that rigid inflexibility of
honour, which forms the proper ornament of a nobleman and a soldier: Lord
Kimbolton, soon after Earl of Manchester, a person distinguished by humanity,
generosity, affability, and every amiable virtue. These men, finding that their
credit ran high with the nation, ventured to encourage those popular disorders,
which, they vainly imagined, they possessed authority sufficient to regulate and
controul.

{#57} ^In^ order to obtain a majority in the upper house, the commons had
recourse to the populace, who, on other occasions, had done them such important
service. Amidst the greatest security, they affected continual fears of
destruction to themselves and the nation, and seemed to quake at every breath or
rumour of danger. They again, excited the people by never-ceasing enquiries
after conspiracies, by reports of insurrections, by feigned intelligence of
invasions from abroad, by discoveries of dangerous combinations at home among
papists and their adherents. When Charles dismissed the guard, which they had
ordered during his absence, they complained; and, upon his promising them a new
guard, under the command of the earl of Lindesey, they absolutely refused the
offer, and were well pleased to insinuate, by this instance of jealousy, that
their danger chiefly arose from the king himself[n60]. They ordered halberts to
be brought into the hall where they assembled, |and thus armed themselves
against those conspiracies, with which, they pretended, they were hourly
threatened. All stories of plots, however ridiculous, were willingly attended
to, and were dispersed among the multitude, to whose capacity they were well
adapted. Beale, a taylor, informed the commons, that, walking in the fields, he
had hearkened to the discourse of certain persons, unknown to him, and had heard
them talk of a most dangerous conspiracy. A hundred and eight ruffians, as he
learned, had been appointed to murder a hundred and eight lords and commoners,
and were promised rewards for these assassinations, ten pounds for each lord,
forty shillings for each commoner. Upon this notable intelligence, orders were
issued for seizing priests and jesuits, a conference was desired with the lords,
and the deputy-lieutenants of some suspected counties were ordered to put the
people in a posture of defence[n61].

{#58} ^The^ pulpits likewise were called in aid, and resounded with the dangers,
which threatened religion, from the desperate attempts of papists and
malignants. Multitudes flocked towards Westminster, and insulted the prelates
and such of the lords as adhered to the crown. The peers voted a declaration
against those tumults, and sent it to the lower house; but these refused their
concurrence[n62]. Some seditious apprentices, being seized and committed to
prison, immediately received their liberty; by an order of the commons[n63]. The
sheriffs and justices having appointed constables with strong watches to guard
the parliament; the commons sent for the constables, and required them to
discharge the watches, convened the justices, voted their orders a breach of
privilege, and sent one of them to the Tower[n64]. Encouraged by these
intimations of their pleasure, the populace crouded about Whitehall, and threw
out insolent menaces against Charles himself. Several reduced officers and young
gentlemen of the inns of court, during this time of disorder and danger, offered
their service to the king. Between them and the populace there passed frequent
skirmishes, which ended not without bloodshed. By way of reproach, these
gentlemen gave the rabble the appellation of ROUNDHEADS; on account |of the
short cropt hair which they wore: These called the others CAVALIERS. And thus
the nation, which was before sufficiently provided with religious as well as
civil causes of quarrel, was also supplied with party-names, under which the
factions might rendezvous and signalize their mutual hatred[n65].

{#59} ^Meanwhile^ the tumults still continued, and even encreased about
Westminster and Whitehall. The cry incessantly resounded against _bishops and
rotten-hearted lords[n66]._The former especially, being distinguishable by their
habit, and being the object of violent hatred to all the sectaries, were exposed
to the most dangerous insults[n67]. Williams, now created archbishop of York,
having been abused by the populace, #Decemb. 27.# hastily called a meeting of
his brethren. By his advice, a protestation was drawn and addressed to the king
and the house of lords. The bishops there set forth, that though they had an
undoubted right to sit and vote in parliament, yet in coming thither, they had
been menaced, assaulted, affronted, by the unruly multitude, and could no longer
with safety attend their duty in the house. For this reason they protested
against all laws, votes, and resolutions, as null and invalid, which should pass
during the time of their constrained absence. This protestation, which, though
just and legal, was certainly ill-timed, was signed by twelve bishops, and
communicated to the king, who hastily approved of it. As soon as it was
presented to the lords, that house desired a conference with the commons, whom
they informed of this unexpected protestation. The opportunity was seized with
joy and triumph. #Impeachment of the bishops.# An impeachment of high treason
was immediately sent up against the bishops, as endeavouring to subvert the
fundamental laws, and to invalidate the authority of the legislature[n68]. They
were, on the first demand, sequestered from parliament, and committed to
custody. No man, in either house, ventured to speak a word in their vindication;
so much displeased was every one at the egregious imprudence, of which they had
been guilty. One person alone said, that he did not believe them guilty of high
treason; but that they were stark mad, and therefore desired they might be sent
to bedlam[n69].

{#60} #1642.# ^A^ few days after, the king was betrayed into another
indiscretion, much more fatal: An indiscretion, to which all the ensuing
disorders and civil wars ought immediately and directly to be ascribed. This was
the impeachment of lord Kimbolton and the five members.

{#61} ^When^ the commons employed, in their remonstrance, language so severe and
indecent, they had not been actuated entirely by insolence and passion: Their
views were more solid and profound. They considered, that, in a violent attempt,
such as an invasion of the ancient constitution, the more leisure was afforded
the people to reflect, the less would they be inclined to second that rash and
dangerous enterprize; that the peers would certainly refuse their concurrence,
nor were there any hopes of prevailing on them, but by instigating the populace
to tumult and disorder; that the employing of such odious means for so invidious
an end, would, at long-run, lose them all their popularity, and turn the tide of
favour to the contrary party; and that, if the king only remained in
tranquillity, and cautiously eluded the first violence of the tempest, he would,
in the end, certainly prevail, and be able at least to preserve the ancient laws
and constitution. They were therefore resolved, if possible, to excite him to
some violent passion; in hopes that he would commit indiscretions, of which they
might make advantage.

{#62} ^It^ was not long before they succeeded beyond their fondest wishes.
Charles was enraged to find that all his concessions but encreased their
demands; that the people, who were returning to a sense of duty towards him,
were again roused to sedition and tumults; that the blackest calumnies were
propagated against him, and even the Irish massacre ascribed to his counsels and
machinations; and that a method of address was adopted not only unsuitable
towards so great a prince, but which no private gentleman could bear without
resentment. When he considered all these increasing acts of insolence in the
commons, he was apt to ascribe them, in a great measure, to his own indolence
and facility. The queen and the ladies of the court farther stimulated his
passion, and represented, that, if he exerted the vigour, and displayed the
majesty of a monarch, the daring usurpations of his subjects would shrink before
him. Lord Digby, a man of fine parts, but full of levity, and hurried on by
precipitate passions, suggested like counsels; |and Charles, who, though
commonly moderate in his temper, was ever disposed to hasty resolutions, gave
way to the fatal importunity of his friends and servants[n70].

{#63} #Accusations of the five members.# ^Herbert^, attorney general, appeared
in the house of peers, and, in his majesty's name, entered an accusation of high
treason against lord Kimbolton and five commoners, Hollis, Sir Arthur Hazlerig,
Hambden, Pym, and Strode. The articles were, That they had traiterously
endeavoured to subvert the fundamental laws and government of the kingdom, to
deprive the king of his regal power, and to impose on his subjects an arbitrary
and tyrannical authority; that they had endeavoured, by many foul aspersions on
his majesty and his government, to alienate the affections of his people, and
make him odious to them; that they had attempted to draw his late army to
disobedience of his royal commands, and to side with them in their traiterous
designs; that they had invited and encouraged a foreign power to invade the
kingdom; that they had aimed at subverting the rights and very being of
parliament; that in order to complete their traiterous designs, they had
endeavoured, as far as in them lay, by force and terror, to compel the
parliament to join with them, and, to that end, had actually raised and
countenanced tumults against the king and parliament; and that they had
traiterously conspired to levy and actually had levied, war against the
king[n71].

{#64} ^The^ whole world stood amazed at this important accusation, so suddenly
entered upon, without concert, deliberation, or reflection. Some of these
articles of accusation, men said, to judge by appearance, seem to be common
between the impeached members and the parliament; nor did these persons appear
any farther active in the enterprizes, of which they were accused, than so far
as they concurred with the majority in their votes and speeches. Though proofs,
might, perhaps, be produced, of their privately inviting the Scots to invade
England; how could such an attempt be considered as treason, after the act of
oblivion which had passed, and after that both houses, with the king's
concurrence, had voted that nation three hundred thousand pounds for their
brotherly assistance? While the house of peers are scarcely able to |maintain
their independency, or to reject the bills sent them by the commons; will they
ever be permitted by the populace, supposing them inclined, to pass a sentence,
which must totally subdue the lower house, and put an end to their ambitious
undertakings? These five members, at least Pym, Hambden, and Hollis, are the
very heads of the popular party; and if these be taken off, what fate must be
expected by their followers, who are many of them accomplices in the same
treason? The punishment of leaders is ever the last triumph over a broken and
routed party; but surely was never before attempted, in opposition to a faction,
during the full tide of its power and success.

{#65} ^But^ men had not leisure to wonder at the indiscretion of this measure:
Their astonishment was excited by new attempts, still more precipitate and
imprudent. A serjeant at arms, in the king's name, demanded of the house the
five members; and was sent back without any positive answer. Messengers were
employed to search for them, and arrest them. Their trunks, chambers, and
studies, were sealed, and locked. The house voted all these acts of violence to
be breaches of privilege, and commanded every one to defend the liberty of the
members[n72]. The king, irritated by all this opposition, resolved next day to
come in person to the house, with an intention to demand, perhaps seize in their
presence, the persons whom he had accused.

{#66} ^This^ resolution was discovered to the countess of Carlisle, sister of
Northumberland, a lady of spirit, wit, and intrigue[n73]. She privately sent
intelligence to the five members; and they had time to withdraw, a moment before
the king entered. He was accompanied by his ordinary retinue to the number of
above two hundred, armed as usual, some with halberts, some with walking swords.
The king left them at the door, and he himself advanced alone through the hall;
while all the members rose to receive him. The speaker withdrew from his chair,
and the king took possession of it. The speech, which he made, was as follows;
"Gentlemen, I am sorry for this occasion of coming to you. Yesterday, I sent a
serjeant at arms, to demand some, who, by my order, were accused of high
treason. Instead of obedience, I received a message. I must |here declare to
you, that, though no king, that ever was in England, could be more careful of
your privileges than I shall be, yet in cases of treason no person has
privilege. Therefore, am I come to tell you, that I must have these men
wheresoever I can find them. Well, since I see all the birds are flown, I do
expect that you will send them to me as soon as they return. But I assure you,
on the word of a king, I never did intend any force, but shall proceed against
them in a fair and legal way: For I never meant any other. And now since I see I
cannot do what I came for, I think this is no unfit occasion to repeat what I
have said formerly, that whatever I have done in favour and to the good of my
subjects, I do intend to maintain it[n74]."

{#67} ^When^ the king was looking around for the accused members he asked the
speaker, who stood below, whether any of these persons were in the house? The
speaker, falling on his knee, prudently replied: "I have, Sir, neither eyes to
see, nor tongue to speak in this place, but as the house is pleased to direct
me, whose servant I am. And I humbly ask pardon, that I cannot give any other
answer to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me."[n75]

{#68} ^The^ commons were in the utmost disorder; and, when the king was
departing, some members cried aloud, so as he might hear them,
_Privilege!privilege!_ And the house immediately adjourned till next day[n76].

{#69} ^That^ evening, the accused members, to show the greater apprehension,
removed into the city, which was their fortress. The citizens were the whole
night, in arms. Some people, who were appointed for that purpose, or perhaps
actuated by their own terrors, ran from gate to gate, crying out, that the
cavaliers were coming to burn the city, and that the king himself was at their
head.

{#70} ^Next^ morning Charles sent to the mayor, and ordered him to call a
common-council immediately. About ten o'clock, he himself, attended only by
three or four lords, went to Guildhall. He told the common-council, that he was
sorry to hear of the apprehensions entertained of him; that he was come to them
without any guard, in order to show how much he relied on their affections; and
that he had accused certain men of high-treason, against whom he |would proceed
in a legal way, and therefore presumed that they would not meet with protection
in the city. After many other gracious expressions, he told one of the sheriffs;
who of the two was thought the least inclined to his service, that he would dine
with him. He departed the hall without receiving the applause, which he
expected. In passing through the streets, he heard the cry, _Privilege of
parliament! privilege of parliament!_ resounding from all quarters. One of the
populace, more insolent that the rest, drew nigh to his coach, and called out
with a loud voice, _To your tents, O Israel!_ the words employed by the mutinous
Israelites, when they abandoned Rehoboam, their rash and ill-counselled
sovereign[n77].

{#71} ^When^ the house of commons met, they affected the greatest dismay; and
adjourning themselves for some days, ordered a committee to sit in
merchant-taylors hall in the city. The committee made an exact enquiry into all
circumstances attending the king's entry into the house: Every passionate
speech, every menacing gesture of any, even the meanest, of his attendants, was
recorded and aggravated. An intention of offering violence to the parliament, of
seizing the accused members in the very house, and of murdering all who should
make resistance, was inferred. And that unparalleled breach of privilege, so it
was called, was still ascribed to the counsel of papists and their adherents.
This expression, which then recurred every moment in speeches and memorials, and
which, at present, is so apt to excite laughter in the reader, begat at that
time the deepest and most real consternation throughout the kingdom.

{#72} ^A^ letter was pretended to be intercepted, and was communicated to the
committee, who pretended to lay great stress upon it. One catholic there
congratulates another on the accusation of the members; and represents that
incident as a branch of the same pious contrivance, which had excited the Irish
insurrection, and by which the profane heretics would soon be exterminated in
England[n78].

{#73} ^The^ house again met; and, after confirming the votes of their committee,
instantly adjourned, as if exposed to the most eminent perils from the violence
of their enemies. This practice they continued for some time. When the people,
by these affected panics, |were wrought up to a sufficient degree of rage and
terror, it was thought proper, that the accused members should, with a
triumphant and military procession, take their seats in the house. The river was
covered with boats, and other vessels, laden with small pieces of ordnance, and
prepared for fight. Skippon, whom the parliament had appointed, by their own
authority, major-general of the city-militia[n79], conducted the members, at the
head of this tumultuary army, to Westminster-hall. #Tumults.# And when the
populace, by land and by water, passed Whitehall, they still asked with
insulting shouts, _What was become of the king and his cavaliers? And whither
are they fled[n80]?_

{#74} #King leaves London.# ^The^ king, apprehensive of danger from the enraged
multitude, had retired to Hampton-court, deserted by all the world, and
overwhelmed with grief, shame, and remorse, for the fatal measures, into which
he had been hurried. His distressed situation he could no longer ascribe to the
rigors of destiny, or the malignity of enemies: His own precipitancy and
indiscretion must bear the blame of whatever disasters should henceforth befal
him. The most faithful of his adherents, between sorrow and indignation, were
confounded with reflections on what had happened, and what was likely to follow.
Seeing every prospect blasted, faction triumphant, the discontented populace
inflamed to a degree of fury, they utterly despaired of success, in a cause, to
whose ruin friends and enemies seemed equally to conspire.

{#75} ^The^ prudence of the king, in his conduct of this affair, nobody
pretended to justify. The legality of his proceedings met with many and just
apologies; though generally offered to unwilling ears. No maxim of law, it was
said, is more established or more universally allowed, than that privilege of
parliament extends not to treason, felony, or breach of peace; nor has either
house, during former ages, ever pretended, in any of those cases, to interpose
in behalf of its members. Though some inconveniencies should result from the
observance of this maxim; that would not be sufficient, without other authority,
to abolish a principle established by uninterrupted precedent, and founded on
the tacit consent of the whole legislature. "But what are the inconveniencies so
much |dreaded? The king, on pretence of treason, may seize any members of the
opposite faction, and, for a time, gain to his partizans the majority of voices.
But if he seize only a few; will he not lose more friends, by such a gross
artifice, than he confines enemies?" If he seize a great number; is not this
expedient force, open and barefaced? And what remedy, at all times, against such
force, but to oppose to it a force, which is superior? Even allowing that the
king intended to employ violence, not authority, for seizing the members; though
at that time, and ever afterwards, he positively asserted the contrary; yet will
his conduct admit of excuse. That the hall, where the parliament assembles, is
an inviolable sanctuary, was never yet pretended. And if the commons complain of
the affront offered them, by an attempt to arrest their members in their very
presence; the blame must lie entirely on themselves, who had formerly refused
compliance with the king's message, when he peaceably demanded these members.
The sovereign is the great executor of the laws; and his presence was here
legally employed, both in order to prevent opposition, and to protect the house
against those insults which their disobedience had so well merited.

{#76} ^Charles^ knew to how little purpose he should urge these reasons against
the present fury of the commons. He proposed, therefore, by a message, that they
would agree upon a legal method, by which he might carry on his prosecution
against the members, lest farther misunderstandings happen with regard to
privilege. They desired him to lay the grounds of accusation before the house;
and pretended that they must first judge, whether it were proper to give up
their members to a legal trial. The king then informed them, that he would wave,
for the present, all prosecution: By successive messages, he afterwards offered
a pardon to the members; offered to concur in any law that should acquit or
secure them; offered any reparation to the house for the breach of privilege, of
which, he acknowledged, they had reason to complain[n81]. They were resolved to
accept of no satisfaction, unless he would discover his advisers in that illegal
measure: A condition, to which, they knew, that, without rendering himself for
ever vile and contemptible, he could not possibly submit. Meanwhile, they
continued to thunder against the violation of parliamentary privileges, |and, by
their violent outcries, to inflame the whole nation. The secret reason of their
displeasure, however obvious, they carefully concealed. In the king's accusation
of the members, they plainly saw his judgment of late parliamentary proceedings;
and every adherent of the ruling faction dreaded the same fate, should royal
authority be re-established in its ancient lustre. By the most unhappy conduct,
Charles, while he extremely augmented, in his opponents, the will, had also
encreased the ability, of hurting him.

{#77} ^The^ more to excite the people, whose dispositions were already very
seditious, the expedient of petitioning was renewed. A petition from the county
of Buckingham was presented to the house by six thousand subscribers who
promised to live and die in defence of the privileges of parliament[n82]. The
city of London, the county of Essex, that of Hertford, Surrey, Berks, imitated
the example. A petition from the apprentices was graciously received[n83]. Nay,
one was encouraged from the porters; whose numbers amounted, as they said, to
fifteen thousand[n84]. The address of that great body contained the same
articles with all the others; the privileges of parliament, the danger of
religion, the rebellion of Ireland, the decay of trade. The porters farther
desired, that justice might be done upon offenders, as the atrociousness of
their crimes had deserved. And they added, _That if such remedies were any
longer suspended, they should be forced to extremities not fit to be named, and
make good the saying,_ "That necessity has no law."[n85]

{#78} ^Another^ petition was presented by several poor people, or beggars, in
the name of many thousands more; in which the petitioners proposed as a remedy
for the public miseries, _That those noble worthies of the house of peers, who
concur with the happy votes of the commons, may separate themselves from the
rest, and sit and vote as one intire body._ The commons gave thanks for this
petition[n86].

{#79} ^The^ very women were seized with the same rage. A brewer's wife, followed
by many thousands of her sex, brought a petition to the house; in which the
petitioners expressed their terror of the papists and prelates, and their dread
of like massacres, rapes, and outrages, with those which had been committed upon
their sex in Ireland. They had been necessitated, they said, to imitate the
example |of the woman of Tekoah: And they claimed equal right with the men, of
declaring, by petition, their sense of the public cause; because Christ had
purchased them at as dear a rate, and in the free enjoyment of Christ consists
equally the happiness of both sexes. Pym came to the door of the house; and,
having told the female zealots, that their petition was thankfully accepted, and
was presented in a seasonable time, he begged that their prayers for the success
of the commons might follow their petition. Such low arts of popularity were
affected! And by such illiberal cant were the unhappy people incited to civil
discord and convulsions!

{#80} ^In^ the mean time, not only all petitions, which favoured the church or
monarchy, from whatever hand they came, were discouraged; but the petitioners
were sent for, imprisoned, and prosecuted as delinquents: And this unequal
conduct was openly avowed and justified. Whoever desire a change, it was said,
must express their sentiments; for how, otherwise, shall they be known? But
those who favour the established government in church or state, should not
petition; because they already enjoy what they wish for[n87].

{#81} ^The^ king had possessed a great party in the lower house, as appeared in
the vote for the remonstrance; and this party, had every new cause of disgust
been carefully avoided, would soon have become the majority; from the odium
attending the violent measures, embraced by the popular leaders. A great
majority he always possessed in the house of peers, even after the bishops were
confined or chased away; and this majority could not have been overcome, but by
outrages, which, in the end, would have drawn disgrace and ruin on those who
incited them. By the present fury of the people, as by an inundation, were all
these obstacles swept away, and every rampart of royal authority laid level with
the ground. The victory was pursued with impetuosity by the sagacious commons,
who knew the importance of a favourable moment in all popular commotions. The
terror of their authority they extended over the whole nation; and all
opposition, and even all blame vented in private conversation, were treated as
the most atrocious crimes, by these severe inquisitors. Scarcely was it
permitted to find fault with the conduct of any particular member, if |he made a
figure in the house; and reflections, thrown out on Pym, were at this time
treated as breaches of privilege. The populace without doors were ready to
execute, from the least hint, the will of their leaders; nor was it safe for any
member to approach either house, who pretended to controul or oppose the general
torrent. After so undisguised a manner was this violence conducted, that Hollis,
in a speech to the peers, desired to know the names of such members as should
vote contrary to the sentiments of the commons[n88]: And Pym said in the lower
house, that the people must not be restrained in the expressions of their just
desires[n89].

{#82} ^By^ the flight, or terror, or despondency of the king's party, an
undisputed majority remained every-where to their opponents; and the bills sent
up by the commons, which had hitherto stopped with the peers, and would
certainly have been rejected, now passed, and were presented for the royal
assent. These were, the pressing bill with its preamble, and the bill against
the votes of the bishops in parliament. The king's authority was at that time
reduced to the lowest ebb. The queen too, being secretly threatened with an
impeachment, and finding no resource in her husband's protection, was preparing
to retire into Holland. The rage of the people was, on account of her religion,
as well as her spirit and activity, universally levelled against her. Usage, the
most contumelious, she had hitherto borne with silent indignation. The commons,
in their fury against priests, had seized her very confessor; nor would they
release him upon her repeated applications. Even a visit of the prince to his
mother had been openly complained of, and remonstrances against it had been
presented to her[n90]. Apprehensive of attacks still more violent, she was
desirous of facilitating her escape; and she prevailed with the king to pass
these bills, in hopes of appeasing, for a time, the rage of the multitude[n91].

{#83} ^These^ new concessions, however important, the king immediately found to
have no other effect, than had all the preceding ones: They were made the
foundation of demands still more exorbitant. From the facility of his
disposition, from the weakness of his situation, the commons believed, that he
could now refuse them |nothing. And they regarded the least moment of
relaxation, in their invasion of royal authority, as highly impolitic, during
the uninterrupted torrent of their successes. The very moment they were informed
of these last acquisitions, they affronted the queen, by opening some
intercepted letters written to her by lord Digby: They carried up an impeachment
against Herbert, attorney-general, for obeying his master's commands in accusing
their members[n92]. And they prosecuted, with fresh vigour, their plan of the
militia, on which they rested all future hopes of an uncontrouled authority.

{#84} ^The^ commons were sensible, that monarchical government, which, during so
many ages, had been established in England, would soon regain some degree of its
former dignity, after the present tempest was overblown; nor would all their
new-invented limitations be able totally to suppress an authority, to which the
nation had ever been accustomed. The sword alone, to which all human ordinances
must submit, could guard their acquired power, and fully ensure to them personal
safety against the rising indignation of their sovereign. This point, therefore,
became the chief object of their aims. A large magazine of arms being placed in
the town of Hull, they dispatched thither Sir John Hotham, a gentleman of
considerable fortune in the neighbourhood, and of an ancient family; and they
gave him the authority of governor. They sent orders to Goring, governor of
Portsmouth, to obey no commands but such as he should receive from the
parliament. Not content with having obliged the king to displace Lunsford, whom
he had appointed governor of the Tower[n93], they never ceased soliciting him,
till he had also displaced Sir John Biron, a man of unexceptionable character,
and had bestowed that command on Sir John Conyers, in whom alone, they said,
they could repose confidence. After making a fruitless attempt, in which the
peers refused their concurrence, to give public warning, that the people should
put themselves in a posture of defence against the enterprizes of _papists and
other ill-affected persons[n94],_ they now resolved, by a bold and decisive
stroke, to seize at once the whole power of |the sword, and to confer it
entirely on their own creatures and adherents.

{#85} ^The^ severe votes, passed in the beginning of this parliament, against
lieutenants and their deputies, for exercising powers assumed by all their
predecessors, had totally disarmed the crown, and had not left in any magistrate
military authority, sufficient for the defence and security of the nation. To
remedy this inconvenience now appeared necessary. A bill was introduced and
passed the two houses, which restored to lieutenants and deputies the same
powers, of which the votes of the commons had bereaved them; but at the same
time the names of all the lieutenants were inserted in the bill; and these
consisted entirely of men, in whom the parliament could confide. And for their
conduct, they were accountable, by the express terms of the bill, not to the
king, but to the parliament.

{#86} ^The^ policy pursued by the commons, and which had hitherto succeeded to
admiration, was, to astonish the king by the boldness of their enterprizes, to
intermingle no sweetness with their severity, to employ expressions no less
violent than their pretensions, and to make him sensible in what little
estimation they held both his person and his dignity. To a bill so destructive
of royal authority, they prefixed, with an insolence seemingly wanton, a
preamble equally dishonourable to the personal character of the king. These are
the words: "Whereas there has been of late a most dangerous and desperate design
upon the house of commons, which we have just cause to believe an effect of the
bloody counsels of papists and other ill-affected persons, who have already
raised a rebellion in the kingdom of Ireland. And whereas, by reason of many
discoveries, we cannot but fear they will proceed, not only to stir up the like
rebellions and insurrections in this kingdom of England; but also to back them
with forces from abroad, &c."[n95]

{#87} ^Here^ Charles first ventured to put a stop to his concessions; and that
not by a refusal, but a delay. When this demand was made; a demand, which, if
granted, the commons justly regarded as the last they should ever have occasion
to make; he was at Dover, attending the queen and the princess of Orange, in
their embarkation. |He replied, that he had not now leisure to consider a matter
of so great importance, and must therefore respite his answer till his
return[n96]. The parliament instantly dispatched another message to him, with
solicitations still more importunate. They expressed their great grief on
account of his majesty's #22d Feb.# answer to their just and necessary petition.
They represented, that any delay, during dangers and distractions so great and
pressing, was not less unsatisfactory and destructive than an absolute denial.
They insisted, that it was their duty to see put in execution a measure so
necessary for public safety. #28th Feb.# And they affirmed, that the people, in
many counties, had applied to them for that purpose, and, in some places, were,
of themselves and by their own authority, providing against those urgent
dangers, with which they were threatened[n97].

{#88} ^Even^ after this insolence, the king durst not venture upon a flat
denial. Besides excepting to the preamble, which threw such dishonour upon him,
and protesting the innocence of his intentions, when he entered the house of
commons; he only desired that the military authority, if it were defective,
should first be conferred upon the crown; and he promised to bestow commissions,
but such as should be revocable at pleasure, on the same persons whom the
parliament had named in the bill[n98]. By a former message, he had expressed his
wishes, that they would lay before him, in one view, all the concessions, which
they deemed requisite for the settlement of the nation. They pretended, that
they were exposed to perils so dreadful and imminent, that they had not leisure
for such a work[n99]. The expedient, proposed by the king, seemed a sufficient
remedy during this emergence; and yet maintained the prerogatives of the crown
entire and unbroken.

{#89} #1st March.# ^But^ the intentions of the commons were wide of this
purpose, and their panics could be cured by one remedy alone. They instantly
replied, that the dangers and distempers of the nation were such as could endure
no longer delay; and unless the king speedily complied with their demands, they
should be constrained, for the safety of prince and people, to dispose of the
militia by the authority of both houses, and were resolved to do it accordingly.
They asserted, that those parts of the kingdom, which had, from their |own
authority, put themselves in a posture of defence during these prevailing fears
and jealousies, had acted suitably to the declarations and directions of both
houses, and conformably to the laws of the kingdom. And while they thus menaced
the king with their power, they invited him to fix his residence at London,
where, they knew, he would be entirely at mercy[n100].

{#90} "I am so much amazed at this message," said the king in his prompt reply,
"that I know not what to answer. You speak of jealousies and fears! Lay your
hands on your hearts, and ask yourselves, whether I may not likewise be
disturbed with fears and jealousies: And if so, I assure you, that this message
has nothing lessened them."

{#91} "As to the militia, I thought so much of it before I gave that answer, and
am so much assured, that the answer is agreeable to what in justice or reason
you can ask, or I in honour grant, that I shall not alter it in any point."

{#92} "For my residence near you, I wish it might be safe and honourable, and
that I had no cause to absent myself from Whitehall: Ask yourselves whether I
have not[n101]."

{#93} "What would you have? Have I violated your laws? Have I denied to pass any
bill for the ease and security of my subjects? I do not ask what you have done
for me."

{#94} "Have any of my people been transported with fears and apprehensions? I
offer as free and general a pardon as yourselves can devise. All this
considered, there is a judgment of heaven upon this nation, if these
distractions continue."

{#95} "God so deal with me and mine as all my thoughts and intentions are
upright for the maintenance of the true protestant profession, and for the
observance and preservation of the laws; and I hope God will bless and assist
those laws for _my_ preservation."[n102]

{#96} ^No^ sooner did the commons despair of obtaining the king's consent to
their bill, than they instantly voted, that those who advised his majesty's
answer were enemies to the state, and mischievous projectors against the safety
of the nation; that this denial is of such dangerous consequence, that, if his
majesty persist in it, it will hazard the peace and tranquillity of all his
kingdoms, unless |some speedy remedy be applied by the wisdom and authority of
both houses; and that such of the subjects as have put themselves in a posture
of defence against the common danger, have done nothing but what is justifiable,
and approved by the house[n103].

{#97} ^Lest^ the people might be averse to the seconding of all these
usurpations, they were plied anew with rumours of danger, with the terrors of
invasion, with the dread of English and Irish papists; and the most
unaccountable panics were spread throughout the nation. Lord Digby having
entered Kingston in a coach and six, attended by a few livery-servants, the
intelligence was conveyed to London; and it was immediately voted, that he had
appeared in a hostile manner, to the terror and affright of his majesty's
subjects, and had levied war against the king and kingdom[n104]. Petitions from
all quarters loudly demanded of the parliament to put the nation in a posture of
defence; and the county of Stafford in particular expressed such dread of an
insurrection among the papists, that every man, they said, was constrained to
stand upon his guard, not even daring to go to church unarmed[n105].

{#98} #King arrives at York.# ^That^ the same violence by which he had so long
been oppressed, might not still reach him, and extort his consent to the militia
bill, Charles had resolved to remove farther from London: And accordingly,
taking the prince of Wales and the duke of York along with him, he arrived, by
slow journies, at York, which he determined for some time to make the place of
his residence. The distant parts of the kingdom, being removed from that furious
vortex of new principles and opinions, which had transported the capital, still
retained a sincere regard for the church and monarchy; and the king here found
marks of attachment beyond what he had before expected[n106]. From all quarters
of England, the prime nobility and gentry, either personally, or by messages and
letters, expressed their duty towards him; and exhorted him to save himself and
them from that ignominious slavery, with which they were threatened. The small
interval of time, which had passed since the fatal accusation of the members,
had been sufficient to open the eyes of many, and to recover them from the
astonishment, with which at first they had been seized. One rash and passionate
attempt |of the king's seemed but a small counterbalance to so many acts of
deliberate violence, which had been offered to him, and every branch of the
legislature: And, however sweet the sound of liberty, many resolved to adhere to
that moderate freedom transmitted them from their ancestors, and now better
secured by such important concessions; rather than, by engaging in a giddy
search after more independence, run a manifest risk, either of incurring a cruel
subjection, or abandoning all law and order.

{#99} ^Charles^, finding himself supported by a considerable party in the
kingdom, began to speak in a firmer tone, and to retort the accusations of the
commons with a vigour, which he had not before exerted. Notwithstanding their
remonstrances, and menaces, and insults, he still persisted in refusing their
bill; and they proceeded to frame an ordinance, in which, by the authority of
the two houses, without the king's consent, they named lieutenants for all the
counties, and conferred on them the command of the whole military force, of all
the guards, garrisons, and forts of the kingdom. He issued proclamations against
this manifest usurpation; and, as he professed a resolution strictly to observe
the law himself, so was he determined, he said, to oblige every other person to
pay it a like obedience. The name of the king was so essential to all laws, and
so familiar in all acts of executive authority, that, the parliament was afraid,
had they totally omitted it, that the innovation would be too sensible to the
people. In all commands, therefore, which they conferred, they bound the persons
to obey the orders of his majesty, signified by both houses of parliament. And,
inventing a distinction, hitherto unheard of, between the office and the person
of the king; those very forces, which they employed against him, they levied in
his name, and by his authority[n107].

{#100} ^It^ is remarkable how much the topics of argument were now reversed
between the parties. The king, while he acknowledged his former error, of
employing a plea of necessity, in order to infringe the laws and constitution,
warned the parliament not to imitate an example, on which they threw such
violent blame; and the parliament, while they cloathed their personal fears or
ambition under the appearance of national and imminent danger, made unknowingly
an apology for the most exceptionable part of the king's |conduct. That the
liberties of the people were no longer exposed to any peril from royal
authority, so narrowly circumscribed, so exactly defined, so much unsupported by
revenue and by military power, might be maintained upon very plausible topics:
But that the danger, allowing it to have any existence, was not of that kind;
great, urgent, inevitable; which dissolves all law and levels all limitations,
seems apparent from the simplest view of these transactions. So obvious indeed
was the king's present inability to invade the constitution, that the fears and
jealousies, which operated on the people, and pushed them so furiously to arms,
were undoubtedly not of a civil, but of a religious nature. The distempered
imaginations of men were agitated with a continual dread of popery, with a
horror against prelacy, with an antipathy to ceremonies and the liturgy, and
with a violent affection for whatever was most opposite to these objects of
aversion. The fanatical spirit, let loose, confounded all regard to ease,
safety, interest; and dissolved every moral and civil obligation[n108].

{#101} ^Each^ party was now willing to throw on its antagonist the odium of
commencing a civil war; but both of them prepared for an event which they deemed
inevitable. To gain the people's favour and good opinion, was the chief point on
both sides. Never was there a people less corrupted by vice, and more actuated
by principle, than the English during that period: Never were there individuals
who possessed more capacity, more courage, more public spirit, more
disinterested zeal. The infusion of one ingredient, in too large a proportion,
had corrupted all these noble principles, and converted them into the most
virulent poison. To determine his choice in the approaching contests, every man
hearkened with avidity to the reasons proposed on both sides. The war of the pen
preceded that of the sword, and daily sharpened the humours of the opposite
parties. Besides private adventurers without number, the king and parliament
themselves carried on the controversy, by messages, remonstrances, and
declarations; where the nation was really the party, to whom all arguments were
addressed. Charles had here a double advantage. Not only his cause was more
favourable, as supporting the ancient government in church and state |against
the most illegal pretensions: It was also defended with more art and eloquence.
Lord Falkland had accepted the office of secretary; a man who adorned the purest
virtue with the richest gifts of nature, and the most valuable acquisitions of
learning. By him, assisted by the king himself, were the memorials of the royal
party chiefly composed. So sensible was Charles of his superiority in this
particular, that he took care to disperse every where the papers of the
parliament together with his own, that the people might be the more enabled, by
comparison, to form a judgment between them: The parliament, while they
distributed copies of their own, were anxious to suppress all the king's
compositions[n109].

{#102} ^To^ clear up the principles of the constitution, to mark the boundaries
of the powers entrusted by law to the several members, to show what great
improvements the whole political system had received from the king's late
concessions, to demonstrate his entire confidence in his people, and his
reliance on their affections, to point out the ungrateful returns which had been
made him, and the enormous encroachments, insults, and indignities, to which he
had been exposed; these were the topics, which, with so much justness of
reasoning and propriety of expression, were insisted on in the king's
declarations and remonstrances[n110].

{#103} ^Though^ these writings were of consequence, and tended much to reconcile
the nation to Charles, it was evident that they would not be decisive, and that
keener weapons must determine the controversy. To the ordinance of the
parliament concerning the militia, the king opposed his commissions of array.
The counties obeyed the one or the other, according as they stood affected. And
in many counties, where the people were divided, mobbish combats and skirmishes
ensued[n111]. The parliament, on this occasion, went so far as to vote, "That
when the lords and commons in parliament, which is the supreme court of
judicature, shall declare what the law of the land is, to have this not only
questioned, but contradicted, is a high breach of their privileges."[n112] This
was a plain assuming of the whole legislative authority, and exerting it in the
most material article, the government of the militia. Upon the |same principles
they pretended, by a verbal criticism on the tense of a Latin verb, to ravish
from the king his negative voice in the legislature[n113].

{#104} ^The^ magazine of Hull contained the arms of all the forces levied
against the Scots; and Sir John Hotham, the governor, though he had accepted of
a commission from the parliament, was not thought to be much disaffected to the
church and monarchy. Charles, therefore, entertained hopes, that, if he
presented himself at Hull before the commencement of hostilities, Hotham,
overawed by his presence, would admit him with his retinue; after which he might
easily render himself master of the place. But the governor was on his guard. He
shut the gates, and refused to receive the king, who desired leave to enter with
twenty persons only. Charles immediately, proclaimed him traitor, and complained
to the parliament of his disobedience. The parliament avowed and justified the
action[n114].

{#105} #Preparations.# ^The^ county of York levied a guard for the king of 600
men: For the kings of England had hitherto lived among their subjects like
fathers among their children, and had derived all their security from the
dignity of their character, and from the protection of the laws. The two houses,
though they had already levied a guard for themselves; had attempted to seize
all the military power, all the navy, and all the forts of the kingdom; and had
openly employed their authority in every kind of warlike preparations: Yet
immediately voted, "That the king, seduced by wicked counsel, intended to make
war against his parliament, who, in all their consultations and actions, had
proposed no other end, but the care of his kingdoms, and the performance of all
duty and loyalty to his person; that this attempt was a breach of the trust
reposed in him by his people, contrary to his oath, and tending to a dissolution
of the government; and that whoever should assist him in such a war, were
traitors by the fundamental laws of the kingdom."[n115]

{#106} ^The^ armies, which had been every-where raised on pretence of the
service in Ireland, were henceforth more openly inlisted by the parliament for
their own purposes, and the command of them was given to the earl of Essex. In
London no less than four thousand men inlisted in one day[n116]. And the
parliament voted a declaration, which they required every member to subscribe,
that they would live and die with their general.

{#107} #10th June.# ^They^ issued orders for bringing in loans of money and
plate, in order to maintain forces which should defend the king and both houses
of parliament: For this stile they still preserved. Within ten days, vast
quantities of plate were brought to their treasurers. Hardly were there men enow
to receive it, or room sufficient to stow it: And many, with regret, were
obliged to carry back their offerings, and wait till the treasures could find
leisure to receive them. Such zeal animated the pious partizans of the
parliament, especially in the city! The women gave up all the plate and
ornaments of their houses, and even their silver thimbles and bodkins, in order
to support the _good cause_ against the malignants[n117].

{#108} ^Meanwhile^ the splendor of the nobility, with which the king was
environed, much eclipsed the appearance at Westminster. Lord-keeper Littleton,
after sending the great seal before him, had fled to York. Above forty peers of
the first rank attended the king[n118]; whilst the house of lords seldom
consisted of more than sixteen members. Near the moiety too of the lower house
absented themselves from counsels; which they deemed so full of danger. The
commons sent up an impeachment against nine peers, for deserting their duty in
parliament. Their own members also, who should return to them, they voted not to
admit, till satisfied concerning the reason of their absence.

{#109} ^Charles^ made a declaration to the peers, who attended him, that he
expected from them no obedience to any commands which were not warranted by the
laws of the land. The peers answered this declaration by a protest, in which
they declared their resolution to obey no commands but such as were warranted by
that authority[n119]. By these deliberate engagements, so worthy of an English
|prince and English nobility, they meant to confound the furious and tumultuary
resolutions taken by the parliament.

{#110} ^The^ queen, disposing of the crown-jewels in Holland, had been enabled
to purchase a cargo of arms and ammunition. Part of these, after escaping many
perils, arrived safely to the king. His preparations were not near so forward as
those of the parliament. In order to remove all jealousy, he had resolved, that
their usurpations and illegal pretensions should be apparent to the whole world,
and thought, that, to recover the confidence of the people, was a point much
more material to his interest, than the collecting of any magazines, stores or
armies, which might breed apprehensions of violent or illegal counsels. But the
urgent necessity of his situation no longer admitted of delay. He now prepared
himself for defence. With a spirit, activity, and address, which neither the one
party apprehended, nor the other expected, he employed all the advantages which
remained to him, and roused up his adherents to arms. The resources of this
prince's genius encreased in proportion to his difficulties; and he never
appeared greater than when plunged into the deepest perils and distresses. From
the mixed character, indeed, of Charles, arose in part the misfortunes, in which
England was at this time involved. His political errors, or rather weaknesses,
had raised him inveterate enemies: His eminent moral virtues had procured him
zealous partizans: And between the hatred of the one, and the affections of the
other, was the nation agitated with the most violent convulsions.

{#111} ^That^ the king might despair of all composition, the parliament sent him
the conditions, on which they were willing to come to an agreement. Their
demands, contained in nineteen propositions, amounted to a total abolition of
monarchical authority. They required, that no man should remain in the council,
who was not agreeable to parliament; that no deed of the king's should have
validity, unless it passed the council, and was attested under their hand; that
all the officers of state and principal judges should be chosen with consent of
parliament, and enjoy their offices for life; that none of the royal family
should marry without consent of parliament or council; that the laws should be
executed against catholics; that the votes of popish lords should be excluded;
that the reformation of the liturgy and church-government should have place,
according to advice of parliament; that the ordinance, |with regard to the
militia, be submitted to; that the justice of parliament pass upon all
delinquents; that a general pardon be granted, with such exceptions as should be
advised by parliament; that the forts and castles be disposed of by consent of
parliament; and that no peer be made but with consent of both houses[n120].

{#112} "Should I grant these demands," said the king in reply, "I may be waited
on bareheaded; I may have my hand kissed; the title of Majesty may be continued
to me; and _The king's authority, signified by both houses,_ may still be the
stile of your commands; I may have swords and maces carried before me, and
please myself with the sight of a crown and scepter (though even these twigs
would not long flourish, when the stock upon which they grew was dead): But as
to true and real power, I should remain but the outside, but the picture, but
the sign of a king."[n121] War on any terms was esteemed, by the king and all
his counsellors, preferable to so ignominious a peace. Charles accordingly
resolved to support his authority by arms. "His towns," he said, "were taken
from him, his ships, his arms, his money; but there still remained to him a good
cause, and the hearts of his loyal subjects, which, with God's blessing, he
doubted not, would recover all the rest." Collecting therefore some forces, he
advanced southwards; #25th Aug.# and at Nottingham he erected his royal
standard, the open signal of discord and civil war throughout the kingdom.

{#n46} It is now so universally allowed, notwithstanding some muttering to the
contrary, that the king had no hand in the Irish rebellion, that it will be
superfluous to insist on a point which seems so clear. I shall only suggest a
very few arguments, among an infinite number which occur. (1) Ought the
affirmation of perfidious, infamous rebels ever to have passed for any
authority? (2) Nobody can tell us what the words of the pretended commission
were. That commission which we find in Rushworth, vol. v. p. 400, and in
Milton's Works, Toland's edition, is plainly an imposture; because it pretends
to be dated in October 1641, yet mentions facts which happened not till some
months after. It appears that the Irish rebels, observing some inconsistence in
their first forgery, were obliged to forge this commission anew, yet could not
render it coherent or probable. (3) Nothing could be more obviously pernicious
to the king's cause than the Irish rebellion; because it increased his
necessities, and rendered him still more dependent on the parliament, who had
before sufficiently shown on what terms they would assist him. (4) The instant
the king heard of the rebellion, which was a very few days after its
commencement, he wrote to the parliament, and gave over to them the management
of the war. Had he built any projects on that rebellion, would he not have
waited some time, to see how they would succeed? Would he presently have adopted
a measure which was evidently so hurtful to his authority? (5) What can be
imagined to be the king's projects? To raise the Irish to arms, I suppose, and
bring them over to England for his assistance. But is it not plain, that the
king never intended to raise war in England? Had that been his intention, would
he have rendered the parliament perpetual? Does it not appear, by the whole
train of events, that the parliament forced him into the war? (6) The king
conveyed to the justices intelligence which ought to have prevented the
rebellion. (7) The Irish catholics, in all their future transactions with the
king, where they endeavour to excuse their insurrection, never had the assurance
to plead his commission. Even amongst themselves they dropped that pretext. It
appears that Sir Phelim Oneale, chiefly, and he only at first, promoted that
imposture. See Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. No. l00, 111, 112, 114, 115, 121, 132,
137. (8) Oneale himself confessed the imposture on his trial and at his
execution. See Nalson, vol. ii. p. 528. Maguire, at his execution, made a like
confession. (9) It is ridiculous to mention the justification which Charles II.
gave to the marquis of Antrim, as if he had acted by his father's commission.
Antrim had no hand in the first rebellion and the massacre. He joined not the
rebels till two years after: It was with the king's consent; and he did
important service, in sending over a body of men to Montrose.

{#n108} The great courage and conduct, displayed by many of the popular leaders,
have commonly inclined men to do them, in one respect, more honour than they
deserve, and to suppose, that, like able politicians, they employed pretences
which they secretly despised, in order to serve their selfish purposes. It is,
however, probable, if not certain, that they were, generally speaking, the dupes
of their own zeal. Hypocrisy, quite pure and free from fanaticism, is perhaps,
except among men fixed in a determined philosophical scepticism, then unknown,
as rare as fanaticism entirely purged from all mixture of hypocrisy. So
congenial to the human mind are religious sentiments, that it is impossible to
counterfeit long these holy fervours, without feeling some share of the assumed
warmth. And, on the other hand, so precarious and temporary, from the frailty of
human nature, is the operation of these spiritual views, that the religious
ecstasies, if constantly employed, must often be counterfeit, and must be warped
by those more familiar motives of interest and ambition, which insensibly gain
upon the mind. This indeed seems the key to most of the celebrated characters of
that age. Equally full of fraud and of ardour, these pious patriots talked
perpetually of seeking the Lord, yet still pursued their own purposes; and have
left a memorable lesson to posterity, how delusive, how destructive, that
principle is by which they were animated.With regard to the people, we can
entertain no doubt, that the controversy was, on their part, entirely
theological. The generality of the nation could never have flown out into such
fury, in order to obtain new privileges and acquire greater liberty than they
and their ancestors had ever been acquainted with. Their fathers had been
entirely satisfied with the government of Elizabeth: Why should they have been
thrown into such extreme rage against Charles, who, from the beginning of his
reign, wished only to maintain such a government? And why not, at least,
compound matters with him, when, by all his laws, it appeared, that he had
agreed to depart from it? Especially, as he had put it entirely out of his power
to retract that resolution. It is in vain, therefore, to dignify this civil war
and the parliamentary authors of it, by supposing it to have any other
considerable foundation than theological zeal, that great and noted source of
animosity among men. The royalists also were very commonly zealots; but as they
were, at the same time, maintaining the established constitution, in state as
well as church, they had an object, which was natural, and which might produce
the greatest passion, even without any considerable mixture of theological
fervour. _The former part of this note was, in the first editions, a part of the
text._

{#n110} In some of these declarations, supposed to be penned by Lord Falkland,
is found the first regular definition of the constitution, according to our
present ideas of it, that occurs in any English composition; at least any
published by authority. The three species of government, monarchical,
aristocratical, and democratical, are there plainly distinguished, and the
English government is expressly said to be none of them pure, but all of them
mixed and tempered together. This stile, though the sense of it was implied in
many institutions, no former king of England would have used, and no subject
would have been permitted to use. Banks and the crown-lawyers against Hambden,
in the case of ship-money, insist plainly and openly on the king's absolute and
sovereign power: And the opposite lawyers do not deny it: They only assert, that
the subjects have also a fundamental property in their goods, and that no part
of them can be taken but by their own consent in parliament. But that the
parliament was instituted to check and controul the king, and share the supreme
power, would, in all former times, have been esteemed very blunt and indiscreet,
if not illegal, language. We need not be surprised that governments should long
continue, though the boundaries of authority, in their several branches, be
implicit, confused, and undetermined. This is the case all over the world. Who
can draw an exact line between the spiritual and temporal powers in catholic
states? What code ascertained the precise authority of the Roman senate, in
every occurrence? Perhaps the English is the first mixed government, where the
authority of every part has been very accurately defined: And yet there still
remain many very important questions between the two houses, that, by common
consent, are buried in a discreet silence. The king's power is, indeed, more
exactly limited; but this period, of which we now treat, is the time at which
that accuracy commenced. And it appears from Warwick and Hobbes, that many
royalists blamed this philosophical precision in the king's penman, and thought
that the veil was very imprudently drawn off the mysteries of government. It is
certain, that liberty reaped mighty advantages from these controversies and
enquiries; and the royal authority itself became more secure, within those
provinces which were assigned to it. _Since the first publication of this
history, the sequel of Lord Clarendon has been published; where that nobleman
asserts, that he himself was the author of most of these remonstrances and
memorials of the king._

{#n113} The king, by his coronation oath, promises that he would maintain the
laws and customs which the people had chosen, _quas vulgus elegerit:_ The
parliament pretended, that _elegerit_ meant _shall chuse;_ and consequently,
that the king had no right to refuse any bills which should be presented him.
