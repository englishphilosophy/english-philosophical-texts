{#1} #1603.# THE crown of England was never transmitted from father to son with
greater tranquillity, than it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart.
During the whole reign of Elizabeth, the eyes of men had been employed in search
of her successor; and when old age made the prospect of her death more
immediate, there appeared none but the king of Scots, who could advance any just
claim or pretension to the throne. He was great grand-son of Margaret, elder
daughter of Henry VII. and, on the failure of the male-line, his hereditary
right remained unquestionable. If the religion of Mary queen of Scots, and the
other prejudices contracted against her, had formed any considerable obstacle to
her succession; these objections, being entirely personal, had no place with
regard to her son. Men also considered, that, though the title, derived from
blood, had been frequently violated since the Norman conquest, such licences had
proceeded more from force or intrigue, than from any deliberate maxims of
government. The lineal heir had still in the end prevailed; and both his
exclusion and restoration had been commonly attended with such convulsions, as
|were sufficient to warn all prudent men not lightly to give way to such
irregularities. If the will of Henry VIII. authorised by act of parliament, had
tacitly excluded the Scottish line; the tyranny and caprices of that monarch had
been so signal, that a settlement of this nature, unsupported by any just
reason, had no authority with the people. Queen Elizabeth too, with her dying
breath, had recognized the undoubted title of her kinsman James; and the whole
nation seemed to dispose themselves with joy and pleasure for his reception.
Though born and educated amidst a foreign and hostile people, men hoped, from
his character of moderation and wisdom, that he would embrace the maxims of an
English monarch; and the prudent foresaw greater advantages, resulting from a
union with Scotland, than disadvantages from submitting to a prince of that
nation. The alacrity, with which the English looked towards the successor, had
appeared so evident to Elizabeth, that, concurring with other causes, it
affected her with the deepest melancholy; and that wise princess, whose
penetration and experience had given her the greatest insight into human
affairs, had not yet sufficiently weighed the ingratitude of courtiers, and
levity of the people.

{#2} ^As^ victory abroad, and tranquillity at home, had attended this princess,
she left the nation in such flourishing circumstances, that her successor
possessed every advantage, except that of comparison with her illustrious name,
when he mounted the throne of England. #First transactions of this reign.# The
king's journey from Edinburgh to London, immediately afforded to the inquisitive
some circumstances of comparison, which even the natural partiality in favour of
their new sovereign, could not interpret to his advantage. As he passed along,
all ranks of men flocked about him, from every quarter; allured by interest or
curiosity. Great were the rejoicings, and loud and hearty the acclamations which
resounded from all sides; and every one could remember how the affability and
popular manners of their queen displayed themselves, amidst such concourse and
exultation of her subjects. But James, though sociable and familiar with his
friends and courtiers, hated the bustle of a mixt multitude; and though far from
disliking flattery, yet was he still fonder of tranquillity and ease. He issued
therefore a proclamation, forbidding this resort of people, on pretence of the
scarcity of |provisions, and other inconveniencies, which, he said, would
necessarily attend it[n1].

{#3} ^He^ was not, however, insensible to the great flow of affection, which
appeared in his new subjects; and being himself of an affectionate temper, he
seems to have been in haste to make them some return of kindness and good
offices. To this motive, probably, we are to ascribe that profuseness of titles,
which was observed in the beginning of his reign; when in six weeks time, after
his entrance into the kingdom, he is computed to have bestowed knighthood on no
less than 237 persons. If Elizabeth's frugality of honours, as well as of money,
had formerly been repined at, it began now to be valued and esteemed: And every
one was sensible, that the king, by his lavish and premature conferring of
favours, had failed of obliging the persons, on whom he bestowed them. Titles of
all kinds became so common, that they were scarcely marks of distinction; and
being distributed, without choice or deliberation, to persons unknown to the
prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility and good-nature, than of
any determined friendship or esteem.

{#4} ^A^ pasquinade was affixed to St. Paul's, in which an art was promised to
be taught, very necessary to assist frail memories, in retaining the names of
the new nobility[n2].

{#5} ^We^ may presume, that the English would have thrown less blame on the
king's facility in bestowing favours, had these been confined entirely to their
own nation, and had not been shared out, in too unequal proportions, to his old
subjects. James, who, through his whole reign, was more guided by temper and
inclination than by the rules of political prudence, had brought with him great
numbers of his Scottish courtiers; whose impatience and importunity were apt, in
many particulars, to impose on the easy nature of their master, and extort
favours, of which, it is natural to imagine, his English subjects would loudly
complain. The duke of Lenox, the earl of Marre, lord Hume, lord Kinloss, Sir
George Hume, secretary Elphinstone[n3], were immediately added to the English
privy council. Sir George Hume, whom he created earl of Dunbar, was his declared
favourite as long as that nobleman lived, and was one of the wisest and most
virtuous, though the least |powerful, of all those whom the king ever honoured
with that distinction. Hay, some time after, was created Viscount Doncaster,
then earl of Carlisle, and got an immense fortune from the crown; all of which
he spent in a splendid and courtly manner. Ramsay obtained the title of Earl of
Holderness; and many others, being raised, on a sudden, to the highest
elevation, encreased, by their insolence, that envy, which naturally attended
them, as strangers and ancient enemies.

{#6} ^It^ must, however, be owned, in justice to James, that he left almost all
the chief offices in the hands of Elizabeth's ministers, and trusted the conduct
of political concerns, both foreign and domestic, to his English subjects. Among
these, secretary Cecil, created successively Lord Essindon, Viscount Cranborne,
and Earl of Salisbury, was always regarded as his prime minister and chief
counsellor. Though the capacity and penetration of this minister were
sufficiently known, his favour with the king created surprize on the accession
of that monarch. The secret correspondence into which he had entered with James,
and which had sensibly contributed to the easy reception of that prince in
England, laid the foundation of Cecil's credit; and while all his former
associates, Sir Walter Raleigh, lord Grey, lord Cobham, were discountenanced on
account of their animosity against Essex, as well as for other reasons, this
minister was continued in employment, and treated with the greatest confidence
and regard.

{#7} ^The^ capacity of James and his ministers in negociation was immediately
put to trial, on the appearance of ambassadors from almost all the princes and
states of Europe, in order to congratulate him on his accession, and to form
with him new treaties and alliances. Beside ministers from Venice, Denmark, the
Palatinate; Henry Frederic of Nassau, assisted by Barnevelt the Pensionary of
Holland, was ambassador from the states of the United Provinces. Aremberg was
sent by Archduke Albert; and Taxis was expected in a little time from Spain. But
he who most excited the attention of the public, both on account of his own
merit and that of his master, was the marquess of Rosni, afterwards duke of
Sully, prime minister and favourite of Henry IV. of France.

{#8} #State of Europe.# ^When^ the dominions of the house of Austria devolved on
Philip II. all Europe was struck with terror; lest the power of a family, which
had been raised by fortune, should now be carried to an |immeasurable height, by
the wisdom and conduct of this monarch. But never were apprehensions found in
the event to be more groundless. Slow without prudence, ambitious without
enterprize, false without deceiving any body, and refined without any true
judgment; such was the character of Philip, and such the character, which,
during his life-time, and after his death, he impressed on the Spanish councils.
Revolted or depopulated provinces, discontented or indolent inhabitants, were
the spectacles, which those dominions, lying in every climate of the globe,
presented to Philip III. a weak prince, and to the duke of Lerma, a minister,
weak and odious. But though military discipline, which still remained, was what
alone gave some appearance of life and vigour to that languishing body; yet so
great was the terror, produced by former power and ambition, that the reduction
of the house of Austria was the object of men's vows, throughout all the states
of Christendom. It was not perceived, that the French empire, now united in
domestic peace, and governed by the most heroic and most amiable prince, that
adorns modern history, was become, of itself, a sufficient counterpoise to the
Spanish greatness. Perhaps, that prince himself did not perceive it, when he
proposed, by his minister, a league with James, #Rosni's negociations.# in
conjunction with Venice, the United Provinces, and the northern crowns; in order
to attack the Austrian dominions on every side, and depress the exorbitant power
of that ambitious family[n4]. But the genius of the English monarch was not
equal to such vast enterprizes. The love of peace was his ruling passion; and it
was his peculiar felicity, that the conjunctures of the times rendered the same
object, which was agreeable to him, in the highest degree advantageous to his
people.

{#9} ^The^ French ambassador, therefore, was obliged to depart from these
extensive views, and to concert with James the means of providing for the safety
of the United Provinces: Nor was this object altogether without its
difficulties. The king, before his accession, had entertained scruples with
regard to the revolt of the Low-Countries, and being commonly open and
sincere[n5], he had, on many occasions, gone so far as to give to the Dutch the
appellation of rebels[n6]: But having conversed more fully with English
|ministers and courtiers, he found their attachment to that republic so strong,
and their opinion of common interest so established, that he was obliged to
sacrifice to politics his sense of justice; a quality, which, even when
erroneous, is respectable as well as rare in a monarch. He therefore agreed with
Rosni to support secretly the states-general, in concert with the king of
France; lest their weakness and despair should oblige them to submit to their
old master. The articles of the treaty were few and simple. It was stipulated,
that the two kings should allow the Dutch to levy forces in their respective
dominions; and should underhand remit to that republic the sum of 1,400,000
livres a-year for the pay of these forces: That the whole sum should be advanced
by the king of France; but that the third of it should be deducted from the debt
due by him to queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniards attacked either of the
princes, they agreed to assist each other; Henry with a force of ten thousand
men, James with that of six. This treaty, one of the wisest and most equitable
concluded by James, during the course of his reign, was more the work of the
prince himself, than any of his ministers[n7].

{#10} #Raleigh's conspiracy.# ^Amidst^ the great tranquillity, both foreign and
domestic, with which the nation was blest, nothing could be more surprising than
the discovery of a conspiracy to subvert the government, and to fix on the
throne Arabella Stuart, a near relation of the king's by the family of Lenox,
and descended equally from Henry VII. Every thing remains still mysterious in
this conspiracy; and history can give us no clue to unravel it. Watson and
Clarke, two catholic priests, were accused of the plot: Lord Grey, a puritan:
Lord Cobham, a thoughtless man, of no fixt principle: And Sir Walter Raleigh,
suspected to be of that philosophical sect, who were then extremely rare in
England, and who have since received the appellation of _free thinkers._
Together with these, Mr. Broke, brother to lord Cobham, Sir Griffin Markham, Mr.
Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What cement could unite men of such discordant
principles in so dangerous a combination; what end they proposed, or what means
proportioned to an undertaking of this nature, has never yet been explained, and
cannot easily be imagined. As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were commonly believed,
after the queen's |death, to have opposed proclaiming the king, till conditions
should be made with him; they were upon that account extremely obnoxious to the
court and ministry; and the people were apt, at first, to suspect, that the plot
was merely a contrivance of secretary Cecil, to get rid of his old confederates,
now become his most inveterate enemies. But the confession, as well as trial of
the criminals, put the matter beyond doubt[n8]. And though no one could find any
marks of a concerted enterprize, it appeared, that men of furious and ambitious
spirits, meeting frequently together, and believing all the world discontented
like themselves, had entertained very criminal projects, and had even entered,
some of them at least, into a correspondence with Aremberg, the Flemish
ambassador, in order to give disturbance to the new settlement.

{#11} ^The^ two priests[n9] and Broke[n10] were executed: Cobham, Grey, and
Markham were pardoned[n11], after they had laid their heads upon the block[n12].
Raleigh too was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in confinement many
years afterwards.

{#12} ^It^ appears from Sully's Memoirs, that Raleigh secretly offered his
services to the French ambassador; and we may thence presume, that, meeting with
a repulse from that quarter, he had recourse, for the same unwarrantable
purposes, to the Flemish minister. Such a conjecture we are now enabled to form;
but it must be confessed, that, on his trial, there appeared no proof of this
transaction, nor indeed any circumstance which could justify his condemnation.
He was accused by Cobham alone, in a sudden fit of passion, upon hearing, that
Raleigh, when examined, had pointed out some circumstances, by which Cobham's
guilt might be known and ascertained. This accusation Cobham afterwards
retracted; and soon after, he retracted his retractation. Yet upon the written
evidence of this single witness, a man of no honour or understanding, and so
contradictory in his testimony; not confronted with Raleigh; not supported by
any concurring circumstance; was that great man, contrary to all law and equity,
found guilty by the jury. His name was at that time extremely odious in England;
and every man was pleased to give sentence against the capital enemy of Essex,
the favourite of the people.

{#13} ^Sir^ Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attorney-general, managed the
cause for the crown, and threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse, as may be deemed
a great reflection, not only on his own memory, but even, in some degree, on the
manners of the age. Traitor, monster, viper, and spider of hell, are the terms,
which he employs against one of the most illustrious men of the kingdom, who was
under trial for life and fortune, and who defended himself with temper,
eloquence, and courage[n13].

{#14} #1604.# ^The^ next occupation of the king was entirely according to his
heart's content. He was employed, in dictating magisterially to an assembly of
divines concerning points of faith and discipline, and in receiving the
applauses of these holy men for his superior zeal and learning. The religious
disputes between the church and the puritans had induced him to call a
conference at Hampton-court, on pretence of finding expedients, which might
reconcile both parties.

{#15} ^Though^ the severities of Elizabeth towards the catholics had much
weakened that party, whose genius was opposite to the prevailing spirit of the
nation; like severities had had so little influence on the puritans, who were
encouraged by that spirit, that no less than seven hundred and fifty clergymen
of that party signed a petition to the king on his accession; and many more
seemed willing to adhere to it[n14]. They all hoped, that James, having received
his education in Scotland, and having sometimes professed an attachment to the
church, established there, would at least abate the rigour of the laws enacted
in support of the ceremonies and against puritans; if he did not show more
particular grace and encouragement to that sect. But the king's disposition had
taken strongly a contrary biass. The more he knew the puritanical clergy, the
less favour he bore to them. He had remarked in their Scottish brethren a
violent turn towards republicanism, and a zealous attachment to civil liberty;
principles nearly allied to that religious enthusiasm, with which they were
actuated. He had found, that being mostly persons of low birth and mean
education, the same lofty pretensions, which attended them in their familiar
addresses to their Maker, of whom they believed themselves the peculiar
|favourites, induced them to use the utmost freedoms with their earthly
sovereign. In both capacities, of monarch and of theologian, he had experienced
the little complaisance, which they were disposed to show him; whilst they
controuled his commands, disputed his tenets, and to his face, before the whole
people, censured his conduct and behaviour. If he had submitted to the indignity
of courting their favour, he treasured up, on that account, the stronger
resentment against them, and was determined to make them feel, in their turn,
the weight of his authority. Though he had often met with resistance and faction
and obstinacy in the Scottish nobility, he retained no ill will to that order;
or rather showed them favour and kindness in England, beyond what reason and
sound policy could well justify: But the ascendant, which the presbyterian
clergy had assumed over him, was what his monarchical pride could never
thoroughly digest[n15].

{#16} ^He^ dreaded likewise the popularity, which attended this order of men in
both kingdoms. As useless austerities and self-denial are imagined, in many
religions, to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being, who created us solely
for happiness, James remarked, that the rustic severity of these clergymen and
of their whole sect had given them, in the eyes of the multitude, the appearance
of sanctity and virtue. Strongly inclined himself to mirth and wine and sports
of all kinds, he apprehended their censure for his manner of life, free and
disengaged. And, being thus averse, from temper as well as policy, to the sect
of puritans, he was resolved, if possible, to prevent its farther growth in
England.

{#17} ^But^ it was the character of James's councils, throughout his whole
reign, that they were more wise and equitable, in their end, than prudent and
political, in the means. Though justly sensible, that no part of civil
administration required greater care or a nicer judgment than the conduct of
religious parties; he had not perceived, that, in the same proportion as this
practical knowledge of theology is requisite, the speculative refinements in it
are mean, |and even dangerous in a monarch. By entering zealously into frivolous
disputes, James gave them an air of importance and dignity, which they could not
otherwise have acquired; and being himself inlisted in the quarrel, he could no
longer have recourse to contempt and ridicule, the only proper method of
appeasing it. The church of England had not yet abandoned the rigid doctrines of
grace and predestination: The puritans had not yet separated themselves from the
church, nor openly renounced episcopacy. Though the spirit of the parties was
considerably different, the only appearing subjects of dispute were concerning
the cross in baptism, the ring in marriage, the use of the surplice, and the
bowing at the name of Jesus. #Conference at Hampton–court.# These were the
mighty questions, which were solemnly agitated in the conference at
Hampton-court between some bishops and dignified clergymen on the one hand, and
some leaders of the puritanical party on the other; the king and his ministers
being present[n16].

{#18} #4th Jan.# ^The^ puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain of a
partial and unfair management of the dispute; as if the search after truth were
in any degree the object of such conferences, and a candid indifference, so rare
even among private enquirers in _philosophical_ questions, could ever be
expected among princes and prelates, in a _theological_ controversy. The king,
it must be confessed, from the beginning of the conference, showed the strongest
propensity to the established church, and frequently inculcated a maxim, which,
though it has some foundation, is to be received with great limitations, NO
BISHOP, NO KING. The bishops, in their turn, were very liberal of their praises
towards the royal disputant; and the archbishop of Canterbury said, that_
undoubtedly his majesty spake by the special assistance of God's spirit[n17]._ A
few alterations in the liturgy were agreed to, and both parties separated with
mutual dissatisfaction.

{#19} ^It^ had frequently been the practice of the puritans to form certain
assemblies, which they called _prophesyings;_ where alternately, as moved by the
spirit, they displayed their zeal in prayers and exhortations, and raised their
own enthusiasm, as well as that of their audience, to the highest pitch, from
that social contagion, which has so mighty an influence on holy fervours, and
from the |mutual emulation, which arose in those trials of religious eloquence.
Such dangerous societies had been suppressed by Elizabeth; and the ministers in
this conference moved the king for their revival. But James sharply replied, _If
you aim at a_ Scottish _presbytery it agrees as well with monarchy as God and
the devil. There_ Jack _and_ Tom _and_ Will _and_ Dick _shall meet and censure
me and my council. Therefore I reiterate my former speech:_ Le Roi s'avisera.
_Stay, I pray, for one seven years before you demand; and then, if you find me
grow pursie and fat, I may perchance hearken unto you. For that government will
keep me in breath, and give me work enough[n18]._ Such were the political
considerations, which determined the king in his choice among religious parties.

{#20} #A parliament.# ^The^ next assembly, in which James displayed his learning
and eloquence, was one that showed more spirit of liberty than appeared among
his bishops and theologians. The parliament was now ready to assemble; #19th
March.# being so long delayed on account of the plague, which had broken out in
London, and raged to such a degree, that above 30,000 persons are computed to
have died of it in a year; though the city contained at that time little more
than 150,000 inhabitants.

{#21} ^The^ speech which the king made on opening the parliament, fully displays
his character, and proves him to have possessed more knowledge and better parts
than prudence or any just sense of decorum and propriety[n19]. Though few
productions of the age surpass this performance either in style or matter; it
wants that majestic brevity and reserve, which becomes a king in his addresses
to the great council of the nation. It contains, however, a remarkable stroke of
candor, where he confesses his too great facility in yielding to the
solicitations of suitors[n20]: A fault, which he promises to correct, but which
adhered to him, and distressed him, during the whole course of his reign.

{#22} ^The^ first business, in which the commons were engaged, was of the utmost
importance to the preservation of their privileges; and neither temper nor
resolution were wanting in their conduct of it.

{#23} ^In^ the former periods of the English government, the house of commons
was of so small weight in the balance of the constitution, |that little
attention had been given, either by the crown, the people, or the house itself,
to the choice and continuance of the members. It had been usual, after
parliaments were prolonged beyond one session, for the chancellor to exert a
discretionary authority, of issuing new writs to supply the place of any
members, whom he judged incapable of attending, either on account of their
employment, their sickness, or other impediment. This practice gave that
minister, and consequently the prince, an unlimited power of modeling at
pleasure the representatives of the nation; yet so little jealousy had it
created, that the commons, of themselves, without any court influence or
intrigue, and contrary to some former votes of their own, confirmed it in the
twenty-third of Elizabeth[n21]. At that time, though some members, whose places
had been supplied on account of sickness, having now recovered their health,
appeared in the house, and claimed their seat; such was the authority of the
chancellor, that, merely out of respect to him, his sentence was adhered to, and
the new members were continued in their places. Here a most dangerous
prerogative was conferred on the crown: But to show the genius of that age, or
rather the channels in which power then ran, the crown put very little value on
this authority; insomuch that two days afterwards, the chancellor, of himself,
resigned it back to the commons, and gave them power to judge of a particular
vacancy in their house. And when the question, concerning the chancellor's new
writs, was again brought on the carpet towards the end of the session, the
commons were so little alarmed at the precedent, that, though they re-admitted
some old members, whose seats had been vacated, on account of slight
indispositions, yet they confirmed the chancellor's sentence, in instances where
the distemper appeared to have been dangerous and incurable[n22]. Nor did they
proceed any farther, in vindication of their privileges, than to vote, _that
during the sitting of parliament, there do not, at any time, any writ go out for
chusing or returning any member without the warrant of the house._ In
Elizabeth's reign we may remark, and the reigns preceding, sessions of
parliament were not usually the twelfth part so long as the vacations; and
during the latter, the chancellor's power, if he pleased to exert it, was
|confirmed, at least left, by this vote, as unlimited and unrestrained as ever.

{#24} ^In^ a subsequent parliament, the absolute authority of the queen was
exerted in a manner still more open; and began for the first time to give alarm
to the commons. New writs having been issued by the chancellor, when there was
no vacancy, and a controversy arising upon that incident; the queen sent a
message to the house, informing them, that it were impertinent for them to deal
in such matters. These questions, she said, belonged only to the chancellor; and
she had appointed him to confer with the judges, in order to settle all disputes
with regard to elections. The commons had the courage, a few days after, to vote
"That it was a most perilous precedent, where two knights of a county were duly
elected, if any new writ should issue out for a second election, without order
of the house itself; that the discussing and adjudging of this and such like
differences belonged only to the house; and that there should be no message sent
to the lord chancellor, not so much as to enquire what he had done in the
matter, because it was conceived to be a matter derogatory to the power and
privilege of the house."[n23] This is the most considerable, and almost only
instance of parliamentary liberty, which occurs during the reign of that
princess.

{#25} ^Outlaws^, whether on account of debts or crimes, had been declared by the
judges[n24], incapable of enjoying a seat in the house, where they must
themselves be lawgivers; but this opinion of the judges had been frequently
over-ruled. I find, however, in the case of Vaughan[n25], who was questioned for
an outlawry, that, having proved all his debts to have been contracted by
suretiship, and to have been, most of them, honestly compounded, he was allowed,
on account of these favourable circumstances, to keep his seat: Which plainly
supposes, that, otherwise, it would have been vacated, on account of the
outlawry[n26].

{#26} ^When^ James summoned this parliament, he issued a proclamation[n27]; in
which, among many general advices, which, like a kind tutor, he bestowed on his
people, he strictly enjoins them not to chuse any outlaw for their
representative. And he adds; _If any person take upon him the place of knight,
citizen, or burgess, not being duly elected, according to the laws and statutes
in that behalf provided, and according to the purport, effect, and true meaning
of this our proclamation, then every person so offending to be fined or
imprisoned for the same._ A proclamation here was plainly put on the same
footing with a law, and that in so delicate a point as the right of elections:
Most alarming circumstances, had there not been reason to believe, that this
measure, being entered into so early in the king's reign proceeded more from
precipitation and mistake, than from any serious design of invading the
privileges of parliament[n28].

{#27} ^Sir^ Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the county of Bucks; and his
return, as usual, was made into chancery. The chancellor, pronouncing him an
outlaw, vacated his seat, and issued writs for a new election[n29]. Sir John
Fortescue was chosen in his place by the county: But the first act of the house
was to reverse the chancellor's sentence, and restore Sir Francis to his seat.
At the king's suggestion, the lords desired a conference on the subject; but
were absolutely refused by the commons, as the question entirely regarded their
own privileges[n30]. The commons, however, agreed to make a remonstrance to the
king by the mouth of their speaker; in which they maintained that, though the
returns were by form made into chancery, yet the sole right of judging with
regard to elections belonged to the house itself, not to the chancellor[n31].
James was not satisfied, and ordered a conference between |the house and the
judges, whose opinion in this case was opposite to that of the commons. This
conference, he said, he commanded as an _absolute_ king[n32]; an epithet, we are
apt to imagine, not very grateful to English ears, but one to which they had
already been somewhat accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth[n33]. He added,
_That all their privileges were derived from his grant, and hoped they would not
turn them against him[n34];_ a sentiment, which, from her conduct, it is
certain, that princess had also entertained, and which was the reigning
principle of her courtiers and ministers, and the spring of all her
administration.

{#28} ^The^ commons were in some perplexity. Their eyes were now opened, and
they saw the consequences of that power, which had been assumed by the
chancellor, and to which their predecessors had, in some instances, blindly
submitted. _By this course,_ said a member, _the free election of the counties
is taken away, and none shall be chosen but such as shall please the king and
council. Let us, therefore, with fortitude, understanding, and sincerity, seek
to maintain our privilege. This cannot be construed any contempt in us, but
merely a maintenance of our common rights, which our ancestors have left us, and
which it is just and fit for us to transmit to our posterity[n35]._ Another
said[n36], _This may be called a_ quo warranto _to seize all our liberties. A
chancellor,_ added a third, _by this course may call a parliament consisting of
what persons he pleases. Any suggestion, by any person, may be the cause of
sending a new writ. It is come to this plain question, whether the chancery or
parliament ought to have authority[n37]._

{#29} ^Notwithstanding^ this watchful spirit of liberty, which now appeared in
the commons, their deference for majesty was so great, that they appointed a
committee to confer with the judges before the king and council. There, the
question of law began to appear, in James's eyes, a little more doubtful than he
had hitherto imagined it; and in order to extricate himself with some honour, he
proposed, that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set aside, and a writ be
issued, by warrant of the house, for a new election. Goodwin gave his consent;
and the commons embraced the expedient; but in such a manner, that, while they
showed their regard |for the king, they secured for the future the free
possession of their seats, and the right, which they claimed, of judging solely
in their own elections and returns[n38].

{#30} ^A^ power like this, so essential to the exercise of all their other
powers, themselves so essential to public liberty, cannot fairly be deemed an
encroachment in the commons; but must be regarded as an inherent privilege,
happily rescued from that ambiguity, which the negligence of some former
parliaments had thrown upon it.

{#31} ^At^ the same time, the commons, in the case of Sir Thomas Shirley,
established their power of punishing, as well the persons at whose suit any
member is arrested, as the officers, who either arrest or detain him. Their
asserting of this privilege admits of the same reflection[n39].

{#32} ^About^ this period, the minds of men, throughout Europe, especially in
England, seem to have undergone a general, but insensible revolution. Though
letters had been revived in the preceding age, they were chiefly cultivated by
those sedentary professions; nor had they, till now, begun to spread themselves,
in any degree, among men of the world. Arts, both mechanical and liberal, were
every day receiving great improvements. Navigation had extended itself over the
whole globe. Travelling was secure and agreeable. And the general system of
politics, in Europe, was become more enlarged and comprehensive.

{#33} ^In^ consequence of this universal fermentation, the ideas of men enlarged
themselves on all sides; and the several constituent parts of the gothic
governments, which seem to have lain long unactive, began, every where, to
operate and encroach on each other. On the continent, where the necessity of
discipline had begotten standing armies, the princes commonly established an
unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or intrigue, the liberties of the
people. In England, the love of freedom, which, unless checked, flourishes
extremely in all liberal natures, acquired new force, and was regulated by more
enlarged views, suitably to that cultivated understanding, which became, every
day, more common, among men of birth and education. A familiar acquaintance with
the precious remains of antiquity excited in every generous breast a passion for
a limited constitution, and begat an emulation |of those manly virtues, which
the Greek and Roman authors, by such animating examples, as well as pathetic
expressions, recommend to us. The severe though popular, government of Elizabeth
had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds: But when a new and a
foreign family succeeded to the throne, and a prince less dreaded and less
beloved; symptoms immediately appeared of a more free and independent genius in
the nation.

{#34} ^Happily^ this prince possessed neither sufficient capacity to perceive
the alteration, nor sufficient art and vigour to check it in its early advances.
Jealous of regal, because conscious of little personal authority, he had
established within his own mind a speculative system of absolute government,
which few of his subjects, he believed, and none but traitors and rebels, would
make any scruple to admit. On which-ever side he cast his eye, everything
concurred to encourage his prejudices. When he compared himself with the other
hereditary sovereigns of Europe, he imagined, that, as he bore the same rank, he
was entitled to equal prerogatives; not considering the innovations lately
introduced by them, and the military force, by which their authority was
supported. In England, that power, almost unlimited, which had been exercised
for above a century, especially during the late reign, he ascribed solely to
royal birth and title; not to the prudence and spirit of the monarchs, nor to
the conjunctures of the times. Even the opposition, which he had struggled with
in Scotland, encouraged him still farther in his favourite notions; while he
there saw, that the same resistance, which opposed regal authority, violated all
law and order, and made way, either for the ravages of a barbarous nobility, or
for the more intolerable insolence of seditious preachers. In his own person,
therefore, he thought all legal power to be centered, by an hereditary and a
divine right: And this opinion might have proved dangerous, if not fatal, to
liberty; had not the firmness of the persuasion, and its seeming evidence,
induced him to trust solely to his right, without making the smallest provision
either of force or politics, in order to support it.

{#35} ^Such^ were the opposite dispositions of parliament and prince, at the
commencement of the Scottish line; dispositions just beginning to exist and to
appear in the parliament[n40], but thoroughly established and openly avowed on
the part of the prince.

{#36} ^The^ spirit and judgment of the house of commons appeared, not only in
defence of their own privileges, but also in their endeavour, though, at this
time, in vain, to free trade from those shackles, which the high exerted
prerogative, and even, in this respect, the ill-judged tyranny of Elizabeth, had
imposed upon it.

{#37} ^James^ had already, of his own accord, called in and annulled all the
numerous patents for monopolies, which had been granted by his predecessor, and
which extremely fettered every species of domestic industry: But the exclusive
companies still remained; another species of monopoly, by which almost all
foreign trade, except that to France, was brought into the hands of a few
rapacious engrossers, and all prospect of future improvement in commerce was for
ever sacrificed to a little temporary advantage of the sovereign. These
companies, though arbitrarily erected, had carried their privileges so far, that
almost all the commerce of England was centered in London; and it appears, that
the customs of that port amounted to 110,000-l. a-year, while those of all the
kingdom beside yielded only seventeen thousand[n41]. Nay, the whole trade of
London was confined to about 200 citizens[n42], who were easily enabled, by
combining among themselves, to fix whatever price they pleased both to the
exports and imports of the nation. The committee, appointed to examine this
enormous grievance, one of the greatest which we read of in English story,
insist on it as a fact well known and avowed, however contrary to present
received opinion, that shipping and seamen had sensibly decayed during all the
preceding reign[n43]. And though nothing be more common than complaints of the
decay of trade even during the most flourishing periods; yet is this a
consequence which might naturally result from such arbitrary establishments, at
a time when the commerce of all the other nations of Europe, except that of
Scotland, enjoyed full liberty and indulgence.

{#38} ^While^ the commons were thus attempting to give liberty to the trading
part of the nation, they also endeavoured to free the landed property from the
burthen of wardships[n44], and to remove |those remains of the feudal tenures,
under which the nation still laboured. A just regard was shown to the crown on
the conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy, sought for, considered as a
matter of right, but merely of grace and favour. The profit, which the king
reaped both from wards and from respite of homage, was estimated; and it was
intended to compound for these prerogatives by a secure and independent revenue.
But after some debates in the house, and some conferences with the lords, the
affair was found to contain more difficulties than could easily, at that time,
be surmounted; and it was not then brought to any conclusion.

{#39} ^The^ same fate attended an attempt of a like nature, to free the nation
from the burthen of purveyance. This prerogative had been much abused by the
purveyors[n45], and the commons shewed some intention to offer the king fifty
thousand pounds a-year for the abolition of it.

{#40} ^Another^ affair of the utmost consequence was brought before the
parliament, where the commons shewed a greater spirit of independence than any
true judgment of national interest. The union of the two kingdoms was zealously,
and even impatiently urged by the king[n46]. He justly regarded it as the
peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated the bloody animosities of
these hostile nations, and had reduced the whole island under one government;
enjoying tranquillity within itself, and security from all foreign invasions. He
hoped, that, while his subjects of both kingdoms reflected on past disasters,
besides regarding his person as infinitely precious, they would entertain the
strongest desire of securing themselves against the return of like calamities,
by a thorough union of laws, parliaments, and privileges. He considered not,
that this very reflection operated, as yet, in a contrary manner, on men's
prejudices, and kept alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which had
been carried to the greatest extremities, and required time to allay it. The
more urgent the king appeared in promoting so useful a measure, the more
backward was the English parliament in concurring with him; while they ascribed
his excessive zeal, to that partiality, in favour of his ancient subjects, of
which they thought, that, on other occasions, they had reason to |complain.
Their complaisance for the king, therefore, carried them no farther than to
appoint forty-four English to meet with thirty-one Scottish commissioners, in
order to deliberate concerning the terms of a union; but without any power of
making advances towards the establishment of it[n47].

{#41} ^The^ same spirit of independence, and perhaps not better judgment,
appeared in the house of commons, when the question of supply was brought before
them, by some members, attached to the court. In vain was it urged, that, though
the king received a supply, which had been voted to Elizabeth, and which had not
been collected before her death; yet he found it burthened with a debt
contracted by the queen, equal to the full amount of it: That peace was not yet
thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland was still expensive to him:
That on his journey from Scotland amidst such a concourse of people, and on that
of the queen and royal family, he had expended considerable sums: And that, as
the courtiers had looked for greater liberalities from the prince on his
accession, and had imposed on his generous nature; so the prince, in his turn,
would expect at the beginning, some mark of duty and attachment from his people
and some consideration of his necessities. No impression was made on the house
of commons by these topics; and the majority appeared fully determined to refuse
all supply. The burthen of government, at that time, lay surprisingly light upon
the people: And that very reason, which to us, at this distance, may seem a
motive of generosity, was the real cause why the parliament was, on all
occasions, so remarkably frugal and reserved. They were not, as yet, accustomed
to open their purses in so liberal a manner as their successors, in order to
supply the wants of their sovereign; and the smallest demand, however requisite,
appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant. The commons seem also to
have been desirous of reducing the crown to still farther necessities, by their
refusing a bill, sent down to them by the lords, for entailing the crown lands
for ever on the king's heirs and successors[n48]. The dissipation, made by
Elizabeth, had probably taught James the necessity of this law, and shewn them
the advantage of refusing it.

{#42} ^In^ order to cover a disappointment with regard to supply, which might
bear a bad construction both at home and abroad, James sent a message to the
house[n49], in which he told them, that he desired no supply; and he was very
forward in refusing what was never offered him. #7th July.# Soon after, he
prorogued the parliament, not without discovering, in his speech, visible marks
of dissatisfaction. Even so early in his reign, he saw reason to make public
complaints of the restless and encroaching spirit of the puritanical party, and
of the malevolence, with which they endeavoured to inspire the commons. Nor were
his complaints without foundation, or the puritans without interest; since the
commons, now finding themselves free from the arbitrary government of Elizabeth,
made application for a conference with the lords, and presented a petition to
the king; the purport of both which was to procure, in favour of the puritans, a
relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws[n50]. The use of the surplice and of the
cross in baptism is there chiefly complained of; but the remedy seems to have
been expected solely from the king's dispensing power[n51]. In the papers, which
contain this application and petition, we may also see proofs of the violent
animosity of the commons against the catholics, together with the intolerating
spirit of that assembly[n52].

{#43} #Peace with Spain. 18th Aug.# ^This^ summer, the peace with Spain was
finally concluded, and was signed by the Spanish ministers at London[n53]. In
the conferences, previous to this treaty, the nations were found to have so few
claims on each other, that, except on account of the support given by England to
the Low-Country provinces, the war might appear to have been continued more on
account of personal animosity between Philip and Elizabeth, than any contrariety
of political interests between their subjects. Some articles in the treaty,
which seemed prejudicial to the Dutch commonwealth, were never executed by the
king; and as the Spaniards made no complaints on that head, it appeared, that,
by secret agreement, the king had expressly reserved the power of sending
assistance to the Hollanders[n54]. The constable of Castile came into England to
ratify the |peace; and on the part of England, the earl of Hertford was sent
into the Low-Countries for the same purpose, and the earl of Nottingham, high
admiral, into Spain. The train of the latter was numerous and splendid; and the
Spaniards, it is said, were extremely surprized, when they beheld the blooming
countenances and graceful appearance of the English, whom their bigotry,
inflamed by the priests, had represented as so many monsters and infernal
demons.

{#44} ^Though^ England, by means of her naval force, was perfectly secure,
during the later years of the Spanish war, James shewed an impatience to put an
end to hostilities; and soon after his accession, before any terms of peace were
concerted or even proposed by Spain, he recalled all the letters of marque[n55],
which had been granted by queen Elizabeth. Archduke Albert had made some
advances of a like nature[n56], which invited the king to take this friendly
step. But what is remarkable; in James's proclamation for that purpose, he
plainly supposes, that, as he had himself, while king of Scotland, always lived
in amity with Spain, peace was attached to his person, and that merely by his
accession to the crown of England, without any articles of treaty or agreement,
he had ended the war between the kingdoms[n57]. This ignorance of the law of
nations may appear surprising in a prince, who was thirty-six years of age, and
who had reigned from his infancy; did we not consider that a king of Scotland,
who lives in close friendship with England, has few transactions to manage with
foreign princes, and has little opportunity of acquiring experience. Unhappily
for James, his timidity, his prejudices, his indolence, his love of amusement,
particularly of hunting, to which he was much addicted, ever prevented him from
making any progress in the knowledge or practice of foreign politics, and in a
little time diminished that regard, which all the neighbouring nations had paid
to England, during the reign of his predecessor[n58].

{#n28} The duke of Sully tells us, that it was a maxim of James, that no prince
in the first year of his reign should begin any considerable undertaking. A
maxim reasonable in itself, and very suitable to his cautious, not to say timid
character. The facility, with which he departed from this pretension, is another
proof, that his meaning was innocent. But had the privileges of parliament been
at that time exactly ascertained, or royal power fully limited, could such an
imagination ever have been entertained by him as to think, that his proclamation
could regulate parliamentary elections?

{#n32} Sir Charles Cornwallis the king's ambassador at Madrid, when pressed by
the duke of Lerma to enter into a league with Spain, said to that minister;
_though his majesty was an_ absolute _king, and therefore not bound to give an
account to any, of his actions; yet that so gracious and regardful a prince he
was of the love and contentment of his own subjects, as I assured myself he
would not think it fit to do any thing of so great consequence without
acquainting them with his intentions._ Winwood, vol. ii. p. 222. Sir Walter
Raleigh has this passage in the preface to his History of the World. _Philip II.
by strong hand and main force, attempted to make himself not only an_ absolute
monarch _over the Netherlands, like unto the kings and monarchs of England and
France, but Turk like, to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental
laws, privileges and ancient rights._ We meet with this passage in Sir John
Davis's question concerning impositions, p. 161. "Thus we see by this
comparison, that the king of England doth lay but his little finger upon his
subjects, when other princes and states do lay their heavy loins upon their
people: What is the reason of this difference? From whence cometh it? assuredly
not from a different power or prerogative? For the king of England is as
absolute a monarch as any emperor or king in the world, and hath as many
prerogatives, incident to his crown." Coke, in Cawdry's case, says, "That by the
ancient laws of this realm, England is an _absolute_ empire and monarchy; and
that the king is furnished with plenary and entire power, prerogative, and
jurisdiction, and is supreme governor over all persons within this realm."
Spencer, speaking of some grants of the English kings to the Irish corporations,
says, "All which, though at the time of their first grant they were tolerable,
and perhaps reasonable, yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient. But all
these will easily be cut off, with the superior power of her majesty's
prerogative, against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforced."
State of Ireland, p. 1537. edit. 1706. The same author in p. 1660, proposes a
plan for the civilization of Ireland; that the queen should create a provost
marshal in every county, who might ride about with eight or ten followers in
search of stragglers and vagabonds: The first time he catches any, he may punish
them more lightly, by the stocks; the second time, by whipping; but the third
time, he may hang them, without trial or process, on the first bough: And he
thinks, that this authority may more safely be entrusted to the provost marshal
than to the sheriff: Because the latter magistrate, having a profit by the
escheats of felons, may be tempted to hang innocent persons. Here a real
absolute, or rather despotic power is pointed out; and we may infer from all
these passages, either that the word _absolute_ bore a different sense from what
it does at present, or that men's ideas of the English, as well as Irish
government were then different. This latter inference seems juster. The word,
being derived from the French, bore always the same sense as in that language.
An absolute monarchy in Charles I.'s answer to the nineteen propositions is
opposed to a limited; and the king of England is acknowledged not to be
absolute. So much had matters changed even before the civil war. In Sir John
Fortescue's treatise of absolute and limited monarchy, a book written in the
reign of Edward the IVth, the word _absolute_ is taken in the same sense as at
present; and the government of England is also said not to be absolute. They
were the princes of the house of Tudor chiefly, who introduced that
administration, which had the appearance of absolute government. The princes
before them were restrained by the barons; as those after them by the house of
commons. The people had, properly speaking, little liberty in either of these
ancient governments, but least, in the more ancient.

{#n38} Even this parliament, which shewed so much spirit and good-sense in the
affair of Goodwin, made a strange concession to the crown, in their fourth
session. Toby Mathews, a member, had been banished by order of the council upon
direction from his majesty. The parliament not only acquiesced in this arbitrary
proceeding, but issued writs for a new election. Such novices were they, as yet,
in the principles of Liberty! See Journ. 14 Feb. 1609. Mathews was banished by
the king, on account of his change of religion to popery. The king had an
indulgence to those who had been educated catholics; but could not bear the new
converts. It was probably the animosity of the commons against the papists,
which made them acquiesce in this precedent, without reflecting on the
consequences! The jealousy of Liberty, though rouzed, was not yet thoroughly
enlightened.

{#n39} Journ. 6th and 7th May, 1604.

{#n40} At that time, men of genius and of enlarged minds had adopted the
principles of liberty, which were, as yet, pretty much unknown to the generality
of the people. Sir Matthew Hales has published a remonstrance against the king's
conduct towards the parliament during this session. The remonstrance is drawn
with great force of reasoning and spirit of liberty; and was the production of
Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Edwin Sandys, two men of the greatest parts and
knowledge in England. It is drawn in the name of the commons; but as there is no
hint of it in the journals, we must conclude, either that the authors, sensible
that the strain of the piece was much beyond the principles of the age, had not
ventured to present it to the house, or that it had been, for that reason,
rejected. The dignity and authority of the commons are strongly insisted upon in
this remonstrance; and it is there said, that their submission to the ill
treatment, which they received during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign, had
proceeded from their tenderness towards her age and her sex. But the authors are
mistaken in these facts: For the house received and submitted to as bad
treatment in the beginning and middle of that reign. The government was equally
arbitrary in Mary's reign, in Edward's, in Harry the eighth and seventh's. And
the farther we go back into history, though there might be more of a certain
irregular kind of liberty among the barons, the commons were still of less
authority.

{#n52} This parliament passed an act of recognition of the king's title in the
most ample terms. They recognized and acknowledged, that immediately upon the
dissolution and decease of Elizabeth, late queen of England, the imperial crown
thereof did, by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted succession, descend
and come to his most excellent majesty, as being lineally, justly, and lawfully
next and sole heir of the blood royal of this realm. 1 James I. cap. 1. The
puritans, though then prevalent, did not think proper to dispute this great
constitutional point. In the recognition of queen Elizabeth the parliament
declares, that the queen's highness is, and in very deed and of most mere right
ought to be, by the laws of God and by the laws and statutes of this realm, our
most lawful and rightful sovereign, liege lady and queen, &c. It appears then,
that, if king James's _divine right_ be not mentioned by parliament, the
omission came merely from chance; and because that phrase did not occur to the
compiler of the recognition; his title being plainly the same with that of his
predecessor, who was allowed to have a divine right.
