£4 _Of the component parts of our reasonings concerning cause and effect._ £4

{#1,pages=82-3} THO' the mind in its reasonings from causes or effects carries
its view beyond those objects, which it sees or remembers, it must never lose
sight of them entirely, nor reason merely upon its own ideas, without some
mixture of impressions, or at least of ideas of the memory, which are equivalent
to impressions. When we infer effects from causes, we must |establish the
existence of these causes; which we have only two ways of doing, either by an
immediate perception of our memory or senses, or by an inference from other
causes; which causes again we must ascertain in the same manner, either by a
present impression, or by an inference from _their_ causes, and so on, till we
arrive at some object, which we see or remember. 'Tis impossible for us to carry
on our inferences _in infinitum_; and the only thing, that can stop them, is an
impression of the memory or senses, beyond which there is no room for doubt or
enquiry.

{#2,pages=83} ^To^ give an instance of this, we may chuse any point of history,
and consider for what reason we either believe or reject it. Thus we believe
that ^C{ae}sar^ was kill'd in the senate-house on the _ides_ of _March_; and
that because this fact is establish'd on the unanimous testimony of historians,
who agree to assign this precise time and place to that event. Here are certain
characters and letters present either to our memory or senses; which characters
we likewise remember to have been us'd as the signs of certain ideas; and these
ideas were either in the minds of such as were immediately present at that
action, and receiv'd the ideas directly from its existence; or they were deriv'd
from the testimony of others, and that again from another testimony, by a
visible gradation, 'till we arrive at those who were eye-witnesses and
spectators of the event. 'Tis obvious all this chain of argument or connexion of
causes and effects, is at first founded on those characters or letters, which
are seen or remember'd, and that without the authority either of the memory or
senses our whole reasoning wou'd be chimerical and without foundation. Every
link of the chain wou'd in that case hang upon another; but there wou'd not be
any thing fix'd to one end of it, capable of sustaining the whole; and
consequently there wou'd be no belief nor evidence. And this actually is the
case with all _hypothetical_ arguments, or reasonings upon a supposition; there
being in them, neither any present impression, nor belief of a real existence.

{#3,pages=84} ^I need^ not observe, that 'tis no just objection to the present
doctrine, that we can reason upon our past conclusions or principles, without
having recourse to those impressions, from which they first arose. For even
supposing these impressions shou'd be entirely effac'd from the memory, the
conviction they produc'd may still remain; and 'tis equally true, that all
reasonings concerning causes and effects are originally deriv'd from some
impression; in the same manner, as the assurance of a demonstration proceeds
always from a comparison of ideas, tho' it may continue after the comparison is
forgot.
