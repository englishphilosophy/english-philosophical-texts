£4 _Of the probability of causes._ £4

{#1,pages=130} WHAT I have said concerning the probability of chances can serve
to no other purpose, than to assist us in explaining the probability of causes;
since 'tis commonly allow'd by philosophers, that what the vulgar call chance is
nothing but a secret and conceal'd cause. That species of probability,
therefore, is what we must chiefly examine.

{#2,pages=130-1} ^The^ probabilities of causes are of several kinds; but are all
deriv'd from the same origin, _viz. the association of ideas to a present
impression_. As the habit, which produces the association, arises from the
frequent conjunction of objects, it must arrive at its perfection by degrees,
and must acquire new force from each instance, that falls under our observation.
The first instance has little or no force: The second makes some addition to it:
The third becomes still more sensible; and 'tis by these slow steps, that our
judgment arrives at a full assurance. But before it attains this pitch of
perfection, it passes thro' several inferior degrees, and in all |of them is
only to be esteem'd a presumption or probability. The gradation, therefore, from
probabilities to proofs is in many cases insensible; and the difference betwixt
these kinds of evidence is more easily perceiv'd in the remote degrees, than in
the near and contiguous.

{#3,pages=131} '^Tis^ worthy of remark on this occasion, that tho' the species
of probability here explain'd be the first in order, and naturally takes place
before any entire proof can exist, yet no one, who is arriv'd at the age of
maturity, can any longer be acquainted with it. 'Tis true, nothing is more
common than for people of the most advanc'd knowledge to have attain'd only an
imperfect experience of many particular events; which naturally produces only an
imperfect habit and transition: But then we must consider, that the mind, having
form'd another observation concerning the connexion of causes and effects, gives
new force to its reasoning from that observation; and by means of it can build
an argument on one single experiment, when duly prepar'd and examin'd. What we
have found once to follow from any object, we conclude will for ever follow from
it; and if this maxim be not always built upon as certain, 'tis not for want of
a sufficient number of experiments, but because we frequently meet with
instances to the contrary; which leads us to the second species of probability,
where there is a _contrariety_ in our experience and observation.

{#4,pages=131} '^Twou^'^d^ be very happy for men in the conduct of their lives
and actions, were the same objects always conjoin'd together, and we had nothing
to fear but the mistakes of our own judgment, without having any reason to
apprehend the uncertainty of nature. But as 'tis frequently found, that one
observation is contrary to another, and that causes and effects follow not in
the same order, of which we have had experience, we are oblig'd to vary our
reasoning on account of this uncertainty, and take into consideration the
contrariety of events. The first question, that occurs on this head, is
concerning the nature and causes of the contrariety.

{#5,pages=132} ^The^ vulgar, who take things according to their first
appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the
causes, as makes them often fail of their usual influence, tho' they meet with
no obstacle nor impediment in their operation. But philosophers observing, that
almost in every part of nature there is contain'd a vast variety of springs and
principles, which are hid, by reason of their minuteness or remoteness, find
that 'tis at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any
contingency in the cause, but from the secret operation of contrary causes. This
possibility is converted into certainty by farther observation, when they
remark, that upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects always betrays a
contrariety of causes, and proceeds from their mutual hindrance and opposition.
A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than
to say, that commonly it does not go right: But an artizan easily perceives,
that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same influence on
the wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of dust,
which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of several
parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim, that the connexion betwixt all
causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its seeming uncertainty in
some instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary causes.

{#6,pages=132-3} ^But^ however philosophers and the vulgar may differ in their
explication of the contrariety of events, their inferences from it are always of
the same kind, and founded on the same principles. A contrariety of events in
the past may give us a kind of hesitating belief for the future after two
several ways. _First_, By producing an imperfect habit and transition from the
present impression to the related idea. When the conjunction of any two objects
is frequent, without being entirely constant, the mind is determin'd to pass
from one object to the other; but not with so entire a habit, as when the union
is uninterrupted, and all the instances we have |ever met with are uniform and
of a piece. We find from common experience, in our actions as well as
reasonings, that a constant perseverance in any course of life produces a strong
inclination and tendency to continue for the future; tho' there are habits of
inferior degrees of force, proportion'd to the inferior degrees of steadiness
and uniformity in our conduct.

{#7,pages=133} ^There^ is no doubt but this principle sometimes takes place, and
produces those inferences we draw from contrary ph{ae}nomena; tho' I am
perswaded, that upon examination we shall not find it to be the principle, that
most commonly influences the mind in this species of reasoning. When we follow
only the habitual determination of the mind, we make the transition without any
reflection, and interpose not a moments delay betwixt the view of one object and
the belief of that, which is often found to attend it. As the custom depends not
upon any deliberation, it operates immediately, without allowing any time for
reflection. But this method of proceeding we have but few instances of in our
probable reasonings; and even fewer than in those, which are deriv'd from the
uninterrupted conjunction of objects. In the former species of reasoning we
commonly take knowingly into consideration the contrariety of past events; we
compare the different sides of the contrariety, and carefully weigh the
experiments, which we have on each side: Whence we may conclude, that our
reasonings of this kind arise not _directly_ from the habit, but in an _oblique_
manner; which we must now endeavour to explain.

{#8,pages=133-4} '^Tis^ evident, that when an object is attended with contrary
effects, we judge of them only by our past experience, and always consider those
as possible, which we have observ'd to follow from it. And as past experience
regulates our judgment concerning the possibility of these effects, so it does
that concerning their probability; and that effect, which has been the most
common, we always esteem the most likely. Here then are two things to be
consider'd, _viz._ the _reasons_ which determine us to make the past a standard
for the future, and |the _manner_ how we extract a single judgment from a
contrariety of past events.

{#9,pages=134} ^First^ we may observe, that the supposition, _that the future
resembles the past_, is not founded on arguments of any kind, but is deriv'd
entirely from habit, by which we are determined to expect for the future the
same train of objects, to which we have been accustom'd. This habit or
determination to transfer the past to the future is full and perfect; and
consequently the first impulse of the imagination in this species of reasoning
is endow'd with the same qualities.

{#10,pages=134} ^But^, _secondly_, when in considering past experiments we find
them of a contrary nature, this determination, tho' full and perfect in itself,
presents us with no steady object, but offers us a number of disagreeing images
in a certain order and proportion. The first impulse, therefore, is here broke
into pieces, and diffuses itself over all those images, of which each partakes
an equal share of that force and vivacity, that is deriv'd from the impulse. Any
of these past events may again happen; and we judge, that when they do happen,
they will be mix'd in the same proportion as in the past.

{#11,pages=134-5} ^If^ our intention, therefore, be to consider the proportions
of contrary events in a great number of instances, the images presented by our
past experience must remain in their _first form_, and preserve their first
proportions. Suppose, for instance, I have found by long observation, that of
twenty ships, which go to sea, only nineteen return. Suppose I see at present
twenty ships that leave the port: I transfer my past experience to the future,
and represent to myself nineteen of these ships as returning in safety, and one
as perishing. Concerning this there can be no difficulty. But as we frequently
run over those several ideas of past events, in order to form a judgment
concerning one single event, which appears uncertain; this consideration must
change the _first form_ of our ideas, and draw together the divided images
presented by experience; since 'tis to _it_ we refer the determination of that
particular event, upon which we reason. |Many of these images are suppos'd to
concur, and a superior number to concur on one side. These agreeing images unite
together, and render the idea more strong and lively, not only than a mere
fiction of the imagination, but also than any idea, which is supported by a
lesser number of experiments. Each new experiment is as a new stroke of the
pencil, which bestows an additional vivacity on the colours, without either
multiplying or enlarging the figure. This operation of the mind has been so
fully explain'd in treating of the probability of chance, that I need not here
endeavour to render it more intelligible. Every past experiment may be
consider'd as a kind of chance; it being uncertain to us, whether the object
will exist conformable to one experiment or another: And for this reason every
thing that has been said on the one subject is applicable to both.

{#12,pages=135} ^Thus^ upon the whole, contrary experiments produce an imperfect
belief, either by weakening the habit, or by dividing and afterwards joining in
different parts, that _perfect_ habit, which makes us conclude in general, that
instances, of which we have no experience, must necessarily resemble those of
which we have.

{#13,pages=135} ^To^ justify still farther this account of the second species of
probability, where we reason with knowledge and reflection from a contrariety of
past experiments, I shall propose the following considerations, without fearing
to give offence by that air of subtilty, which attends them. Just reasoning
ought still, perhaps, to retain its force, however subtile; in the same manner
as matter preserves its solidity in the air, and fire, and animal spirits, as
well as in the grosser and more sensible forms.

{#14,pages=135} ^First^, We may observe, that there is no probability so great
as not to allow of a contrary possibility; because otherwise 'twou'd cease to be
a probability, and wou'd become a certainty. That probability of causes, which
is most extensive, and which we at present examine, depends on a contrariety of
experiments; and 'tis evident an experiment in the past proves at least a
possibility for the future.

{#15,pages=136} ^Secondly^, The component parts of this possibility and
probability are of the same nature, and differ in number only, but not in kind.
It has been observ'd, that all single chances are entirely equal, and that the
only circumstance, which can give any event, that is contingent, a superiority
over another, is a superior number of chances. In like manner, as the
uncertainty of causes is discover'd by experience, which presents us with a view
of contrary events, 'tis plain, that {~~as->when~~} we transfer the past to the
future, the known to the unknown, every past experiment has the same weight, and
that 'tis only a superior number of them, which can throw the ballance on any
side. The possibility, therefore, which enters into every reasoning of this
kind, is compos'd of parts, which are of the same nature both among themselves,
and with those, that compose the opposite probability.

{#16,pages=136} ^Thirdly^, We may establish it as a certain maxim, that in all
moral as well as natural ph{ae}nomena, wherever any cause consists of a number
of parts, and the effect encreases or diminishes, according to the variation of
that number, the effect, properly speaking, is a compounded one, and arises from
the union of the several effects, that proceed from each part of the cause. Thus
because the gravity of a body encreases or diminishes by the encrease or
diminution of its parts, we conclude that each part contains this quality and
contributes to the gravity of the whole. The absence or presence of a part of
the cause is attended with that of a proportionable part of the effect. This
connexion or constant conjunction sufficiently proves the one part to be the
cause of the other. As the belief, which we have of any event, encreases or
diminishes according to the number of chances or past experiments, 'tis to be
consider'd as a compounded effect, of which each part arises from a
proportionable number of chances or experiments.

{#17,pages=136-7} ^Let^ us now join these three observations, and see what
conclusion we can draw from them. To every probability there is an opposite
possibility. This possibility is compos'd of parts, that are entirely of the
same nature with those of the |probability; and consequently have the same
influence on the mind and understanding. The belief, which attends the
probability, is a compounded effect, and is form'd by the concurrence of the
several effects, which proceed from each part of the probability. Since
therefore each part of the probability contributes to the production of the
belief, each part of the possibility must have the same influence on the
opposite side; the nature of these parts being entirely the same. The contrary
belief, attending the possibility, implies a view of a certain object, as well
as the probability does an opposite view. In this particular both these degrees
of belief are alike. The only manner then, in which the superior number of
similar component parts in the one can exert its influence, and prevail above
the inferior in the other, is by producing a stronger and more lively view of
its object. Each part presents a particular view; and all these views uniting
together produce one general view, which is fuller and more distinct by the
greater number of causes or principles, from which it is deriv'd.

{#18,pages=137} ^The^ component parts of the probability and possibility, being
alike in their nature, must produce like effects; and the likeness of their
effects consists in this, that each of them presents a view of a particular
object. But tho' these parts be alike in their nature, they are very different
in their quantity and number; and this difference must appear in the effect as
well as the similarity. Now as the view they present is in both cases full and
entire, and comprehends the object in all its parts, 'tis impossible that in
this particular there can be any difference; nor is there any thing but a
superior vivacity in the probability, arising from the concurrence of a superior
number of views, which can distinguish these effects.

{#19,pages=137-8} ^Here^ is almost the same argument in a different light. All
our reasonings concerning the probability of causes are founded on the
transferring of past to future. The transferring of any past experiment to the
future is sufficient |to give us a view of the object; whether that experiment
be single, or combin'd with others of the same kind; whether it be entire, or
oppos'd by others of a contrary kind. Suppose, then, it acquires both these
qualities of combination and opposition, it loses not upon that account its
former power of presenting a view of the object, but only concurs with and
opposes other experiments, that have a like influence. A question, therefore,
may arise concerning the manner both of the concurrence and opposition. As to
the _concurrence_, there is only the choice left betwixt these two hypotheses.
_First_, That the view of the object, occasion'd by the transference of each
past experiment, preserves itself entire, and only multiplies the number of
views. Or, _secondly_, That it runs into the other similar and correspondent
views, and gives them a superior degree of force and vivacity. But that the
first hypothesis is erroneous, is evident from experience, which informs us,
that the belief, attending any reasoning, consists in one conclusion, not in a
multitude of similar ones, which wou'd only distract the mind, and in many cases
wou'd be too numerous to be comprehended distinctly by any finite capacity. It
remains, therefore, as the only reasonable opinion, that these similar views run
into each other, and unite their forces; so as to produce a stronger and clearer
view, than what arises from any one alone. This is the manner, in which past
experiments concur, when they are transfer'd to any future event. As to the
manner of their _opposition_, 'tis evident, that as the contrary views are
incompatible with each other, and 'tis impossible the object can at once exist
conformable to both of them, their influence becomes mutually destructive, and
the mind is determin'd to the superior only with that force, which remains after
substracting the inferior.

{#20,pages=138-9} ^I am^ sensible how abstruse all this reasoning must appear to
the generality of readers, who not being accustom'd to such profound reflections
on the intellectual faculties of the mind, will be apt to reject as chimerical
whatever strikes not in |with the common receiv'd notions, and with the easiest
and most obvious principles of philosophy. And no doubt there are some pains
requir'd to enter into these arguments; tho' perhaps very little are necessary
to perceive the imperfection of every vulgar hypothesis on this subject, and the
little light, which philosophy can yet afford us in such sublime and such
curious speculations. Let men be once fully perswaded of these two principles,
_That there is nothing in any object, consider'd in itself, which can afford us
a reason for drawing a conclusion beyond it_; and, _That even after the
observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we have no
reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have
had experience;_ I say, let men be once fully convinc'd of these two principles,
and this will throw them so loose from all common systems, that they will make
no difficulty of receiving any, which may appear the most extraordinary. These
principles we have found to be sufficiently convincing, even with regard to our
most certain reasonings from causation: But I shall venture to affirm, that with
regard to these conjectural or probable reasonings they still acquire a new
degree of evidence.

{#21,pages=139} ^First^, 'Tis obvious, that in reasonings of this kind, 'tis not
the object presented to us, which, consider'd in itself, affords us any reason
to draw a conclusion concerning any other object or event. For as this latter
object is suppos'd uncertain, and as the uncertainty is deriv'd from a conceal'd
contrariety of causes in the former, were any of the causes plac'd in the known
qualities of that object, they wou'd no longer be conceal'd, nor wou'd our
conclusion be uncertain.

{#22,pages=139-40} ^But^, _secondly_, 'tis equally obvious in this species of
reasoning, that if the transference of the past to the future were founded
merely on a conclusion of the understanding, it cou'd never occasion any belief
or assurance. When we transfer contrary experiments to the future, we can only
repeat these contrary experiments with their particular |proportions; which
cou'd not produce assurance in any single event, upon which we reason, unless
the fancy melted together all those images that concur, and extracted from them
one single idea or image, which is intense and lively in proportion to the
number of experiments from which it is deriv'd, and their superiority above
their antagonists. Our past experience presents no determinate object; and as
our belief, however faint, fixes itself on a determinate object, 'tis evident
that the belief arises not merely from the transference of past to future, but
from some operation of the _fancy_ conjoin'd with it. This may lead us to
conceive the manner, in which that faculty enters into all our reasonings.

{#23,pages=140-1} ^I shall^ conclude this subject with two reflections, which
may deserve our attention. The _first_ may be explain'd after this manner. When
the mind forms a reasoning concerning any matter of fact, which is only
probable, it casts its eye backward upon past experience, and transferring it to
the future, is presented with so many contrary views of its object, of which
those that are of the same kind uniting together, and running into one act of
the mind, serve to fortify and inliven it. But suppose that this multitude of
views or glimpses of an object proceeds not from experience, but from a
voluntary act of the imagination; this effect does not follow, or at least,
follows not in the same degree. For tho' custom and education produce belief by
such a repetition, as is not deriv'd from experience, yet this requires a long
tract of time, along with a very frequent and _undesign'd_ repetition. In
general we may pronounce, that a person, who wou'd[n23] _voluntarily_ repeat any
idea in his mind, tho' supported by one past experience, wou'd be no more
inclin'd to believe the existence of its object, than if he had contented
himself with one survey of it. Beside the effect of design; each act of the
mind, being separate and independent, has a separate influence, and joins not
its force with that of its fellows. Not being united by any common object,
producing them, |they have no relation to each other; and consequently make no
transition or union of forces. This ph{ae}nomenon we shall understand better
afterwards.

{#24,pages=141-2} ^My^ _second_ reflection is founded on those large
probabilities, which the mind can judge of, and the minute differences it can
observe betwixt them. When the chances or experiments on one side amount to ten
thousand, and on the other to ten thousand and one, the judgment gives the
preference to the latter, upon account of that superiority; tho' 'tis plainly
impossible for the mind to run over every particular view, and distinguish the
superior vivacity of the image arising from the superior number, where the
difference is so inconsiderable. We have a parallel instance in the affections.
'Tis evident, according to the principles above-mentioned, that when an object
produces any passion in us, which varies according to the different quantity of
the object; I say, 'tis evident, that the passion, properly speaking, is not a
simple emotion, but a compounded one, of a great number of weaker passions,
deriv'd from a view of each part of the object. For otherwise 'twere impossible
the passion shou'd encrease by the encrease of these parts. Thus a man, who
desires a thousand pound, has in reality a thousand or more desires, which
uniting together, seem to make only one passion; tho' the composition evidently
betrays itself upon every alteration of the object, by the preference he gives
to the larger number, if superior only by an unite. Yet nothing can be more
certain, than that so small a difference wou'd not be discernible in the
passions, nor cou'd render them distinguishable from each other. The difference,
therefore, of our conduct in preferring the greater number depends not upon our
passions, but upon custom, and _general rules_. We have found in a multitude of
instances, that the augmenting the numbers of any sum augments the passion,
where the numbers are precise and the difference sensible. The mind can perceive
from its immediate feeling, that three guineas produce a greater passion than
two; and _this_ it transfers to |larger numbers, because of the resemblance; and
by a general rule assigns to a thousand guineas, a stronger passion than to nine
hundred and ninety nine. These general rules we shall explain presently.

{#25,pages=142} ^But^ beside these two species of probability, which are deriv'd
from an _imperfect_ experience and from _contrary_ causes, there is a third
arising from ^Analogy^, which differs from them in some material circumstances.
According to the hypothesis above explain'd all kinds of reasoning from causes
or effects are founded on two particulars, _viz._ the constant conjunction of
any two objects in all past experience, and the resemblance of a present object
to any one of them. The effect of these two particulars is, that the present
object invigorates and inlivens the imagination; and the resemblance, along with
the constant union, conveys this force and vivacity to the related idea; which
we are therefore said to believe, or assent to. If you weaken either the union
or resemblance, you weaken the principle of transition, and of consequence that
belief, which arises from it. The vivacity of the first impression cannot be
fully convey'd to the related idea, either where the conjunction of their
objects is not constant, or where the present impression does not perfectly
resemble any of those, whose union we are accustom'd to observe. In those
probabilities of chance and causes above-explained, 'tis the constancy of the
union, which is diminish'd; and in the probability deriv'd from analogy, 'tis
the resemblance only, which is affected. Without some degree of resemblance, as
well as union, 'tis impossible there can be any reasoning: but as this
resemblance admits of many different degrees, the reasoning becomes
proportionably more or less firm and certain. An experiment loses of its force,
when transferr'd to instances, which are not exactly resembling; tho' 'tis
evident it may still retain as much as may be the foundation of probability, as
long as there is any resemblance remaining.
