{#1,pages=173} ACCORDING to the precedent doctrine, there are no objects, which
by the mere survey, without consulting experience, we can determine to be the
causes of any other; and no objects, which we can certainly determine in the
same manner not to be the causes. Any thing may produce any thing. Creation,
annihilation, motion, reason, volition; all these may arise from one another, or
from any other object we can imagine. Nor will this appear strange, if we
compare two principles explain'd above, _that the constant conjunction of
objects determines their causation_, and[n33] _that properly speaking, no
objects are contrary to each other, but existence and non-existence_. Where
objects are not contrary, nothing hinders them from having that constant
conjunction, on which the relation of cause and effect totally depends.

{#2,pages=173} ^Since^ therefore 'tis possible for all objects to become causes
or effects to each other, it may be proper to fix some general rules, by which
we may know when they really are so.

{#3,pages=173} 1. ^The^ cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time.

{#4,pages=173} 2. ^The^ cause must be prior to the effect.

{#5,pages=173} 3. ^There^ must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect.
'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.

{#6,pages=173-4} 4. ^The^ same cause always produces the same effect, and the
same effect never arises but from the same cause. This principle we derive from
experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical reasonings. For when
by any clear experiment we have discover'd the causes or effects of any
ph{ae}nomenon, we immediately extend our observation to |every ph{ae}nomenon of
the same kind, without waiting for that constant repetition, from which the
first idea of this relation is deriv'd.

{#7,pages=174} 5. ^There^ is another principle, which hangs upon this, _viz._
that where several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by
means of some quality, which we discover to be common amongst them. For as like
effects imply like causes, we must always ascribe the causation to the
circumstance, wherein we discover the resemblance.

{#8,pages=174} 6. ^The^ following principle is founded on the same reason. The
difference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from that
particular, in which they differ. For as like causes always produce like
effects, when in any instance we find our expectation to be disappointed, we
must conclude that this irregularity proceeds from some difference in the
causes.

{#9,pages=174} 7. ^When^ any object encreases or diminishes with the encrease or
diminution of its cause, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd
from the union of the several different effects, which arise from the several
different parts of the cause. The absence or presence of one part of the cause
is here suppos'd to be always attended with the absence or presence of a
proportionable part of the effect. This constant conjunction sufficiently
proves, that the one part is the cause of the other. We must, however, beware
not to draw such a conclusion from a few experiments. A certain degree of heat
gives pleasure; if you diminish that heat, the pleasure diminishes; but it does
not follow, that if you augment it beyond a certain degree, the pleasure will
likewise augment; for we find that it degenerates into pain.

{#10,pages=174-5} 8. ^The^ eighth and last rule I shall take notice of is, that
an object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any effect,
is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be assisted by some other
principle, which may forward its influence and operation. For as like effects
necessarily follow from like causes, and in a contiguous time and place, |their
separation for a moment shews, that these causes are not compleat ones.

{#11,pages=175} ^Here^ is all the ^Logic^ I think proper to employ in my
reasoning; and perhaps even this was not very necessary, but might have been
supply'd by the natural principles of our understanding. Our scholastic
head-pieces and logicians shew no such superiority above the mere vulgar in
their reason and ability, as to give us any inclination to imitate them in
delivering a long system of rules and precepts to direct our judgment, in
philosophy. All the rules of this nature are very easy in their invention, but
extremely difficult in their application; and even experimental philosophy,
which seems the most natural and simple of any, requires the utmost stretch of
human judgment. There is no ph{ae}nomenon in nature, but what is compounded and
modify'd by so many different circumstances, that in order to arrive at the
decisive point, we must carefully separate whatever is superfluous, and enquire
by new experiments, if every particular circumstance of the first experiment was
essential to it. These new experiments are liable to a discussion of the same
kind; so that the utmost constancy is requir'd to make us persevere in our
enquiry, and the utmost sagacity to choose the right way among so many that
present themselves. If this be the case even in natural philosophy, how much
more in moral, where there is a much greater complication of circumstances, and
where those views and sentiments, which are essential to any action of the mind,
are so implicit and obscure, that they often escape our strictest attention, and
are not only unaccountable in their causes, but even unknown in their existence?
I am much afraid, lest the small success I meet with in my enquiries will make
this observation bear the air of an apology rather than of boasting.

{#12,pages=175-6} ^If^ any thing can give me security in this particular, 'twill
be the enlarging the sphere of my experiments as much as possible; for which
reason it may be proper in this place |to examine the reasoning faculty of
brutes, as well as that of human creatures.
