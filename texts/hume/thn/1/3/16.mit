{#1,pages=176} NEXT to the ridicule of denying an evident truth, is that of
taking much pains to defend it; and no truth appears to me more evident, than
that beasts are endow'd with thought and reason as well as men. The arguments
are in this case so obvious, that they never escape the most stupid and
ignorant.

{#2,pages=176} ^We^ are conscious, that we ourselves, in adapting means to ends,
are guided by reason and design, and that 'tis not ignorantly nor casually we
perform those actions, which tend to self-preservation, to the obtaining
pleasure, and avoiding pain. When therefore we see other creatures, in millions
of instances, perform like actions, and direct them to like ends, all our
principles of reason and probability carry us with an invincible force to
believe the existence of a like cause. 'Tis needless in my opinion to illustrate
this argument by the enumeration of particulars. The smallest attention will
supply us with more than are requisite. The resemblance betwixt the actions of
animals and those of men is so entire in this respect, that the very first
action of the first animal we shall please to pitch on, will afford us an
incontestable argument for the present doctrine.

{#3,pages=176-7} ^This^ doctrine is as useful as it is obvious, and furnishes us
with a kind of touchstone, by which we may try every system in this species of
philosophy. 'Tis from the resemblance of the external actions of animals to
those we ourselves perform, that we judge their internal likewise to resemble
ours; and the same principle of reasoning, carry'd one step farther, will make
us conclude that since our internal actions resemble each other, the causes,
from which they are deriv'd, |must also be resembling. When any hypothesis,
therefore, is advanc'd to explain a mental operation, which is common to men and
beasts, we must apply the same hypothesis to both; and as every true hypothesis
will abide this trial, so I may venture to affirm, that no false one will ever
be able to endure it. The common defect of those systems, which philosophers
have employ'd to account for the actions of the mind, is, that they suppose such
a subtility and refinement of thought, as not only exceeds the capacity of mere
animals, but even of children and the common people in our own species; who are
notwithstanding susceptible of the same emotions and affections as persons of
the most accomplish'd genius and understanding. Such a subtility is a clear
proof of the falshood, as the contrary simplicity of the truth, of any system.

{#4,pages=177} ^Let^ us therefore put our present system concerning the nature
of the understanding to this decisive trial, and see whether it will equally
account for the reasonings of beasts as for these of the human species.

{#5,pages=177} ^Here^ we must make a distinction betwixt those actions of
animals, which are of a vulgar nature, and seem to be on a level with their
common capacities, and those more extraordinary instances of sagacity, which
they sometimes discover for their own preservation, and the propagation of their
species. A dog, that avoids fire and precipices, that shuns strangers, and
caresses his master, affords us an instance of the first kind. A bird, that
chooses with such care and nicety the place and materials of her nest, and sits
upon her eggs for a due time, and in a suitable season, with all the precaution
that a chymist is capable of in the most delicate projection, furnishes us with
a lively instance of the second.

{#6,pages=177-8} ^As^ to the former actions, I assert they proceed from a
reasoning, that is not in itself different, nor founded on different principles,
from that which appears in human nature. 'Tis necessary in the first place, that
there be some |impression immediately present to their memory or senses, in
order to be the foundation of their judgment. From the tone of voice the dog
infers his master's anger, and foresees his own punishment. From a certain
sensation affecting his smell, he judges his game not to be far distant from
him.

{#7,pages=178} ^Secondly^, The inference he draws from the present impression is
built on experience, and on his observation of the conjunction of objects in
past instances. As you vary this experience, he varies his reasoning. Make a
beating follow upon one sign or motion for some time, and afterwards upon
another; and he will successively draw different conclusions, according to his
most recent experience.

{#8,pages=178} ^Now^ let any philosopher make a trial, and endeavour to explain
that act of the mind, which we call _belief_, and give an account of the
principles, from which it is deriv'd, independent of the influence of custom on
the imagination, and let his hypothesis be equally applicable to beasts as to
the human species; and after he has done this, I promise to embrace his opinion.
But at the same time I demand as an equitable condition, that if my system be
the only one, which can answer to all these terms, it may be receiv'd as
entirely satisfactory and convincing. And that 'tis the only one, is evident
almost without any reasoning. Beasts certainly never perceive any real connexion
among objects. 'Tis therefore by experience they infer one from another. They
can never by any arguments form a general conclusion, that those objects, of
which they have had no experience, resemble those of which they have. 'Tis
therefore by means of custom alone, that experience operates upon them. All this
was sufficiently evident with respect to man. But with respect to beasts there
cannot be the least suspicion of mistake; which must be own'd to be a strong
confirmation, or rather an invincible proof of my system.

{#9,pages=178-9} ^Nothing^ shews more the force of habit in reconciling us to
any ph{ae}nomenon, than this, that men are not astonish'd at the operations of
their own reason, at the same time, that |they admire the _instinct_ of animals,
and find a difficulty in explaining it, merely because it cannot be reduc'd to
the very same principles. To consider the matter aright, reason is nothing but a
wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a
certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to
their particular situations and relations. This instinct, 'tis true, arises from
past observation and experience; but can any one give the ultimate reason, why
past experience and observation produces such an effect, any more than why
nature alone shou'd produce it? Nature may certainly produce whatever can arise
from habit: Nay, habit is nothing but one of the principles of nature, and
derives all its force from that origin.
