{#1,pages=98} HAVING thus explain'd the nature of belief, and shewn that it
consists in a lively idea related to a present impression; let us now proceed to
examine from what principles it is deriv'd, and what bestows the vivacity on the
idea.

{#2,pages=98-9} ^I wou^'^d^ willingly establish it as a general maxim in the
science of human nature, _that when any impression becomes present to us, it not
only transports the mind to such ideas as are related to it, but likewise
communicates to them a share of its force and vivacity_. All the operations of
the mind depend in a great measure on its disposition, when it performs them;
and according as the spirits are more or less elevated, and the attention more
or less fix'd, the action will always have more or less vigour and vivacity.
When therefore any object is presented, which elevates and enlivens the thought,
every action, to which the mind applies itself, will be more strong and vivid,
as long as that disposition continues. Now 'tis evident the continuance of the
disposition depends entirely |on the objects, about which the mind is employ'd;
and that any new object naturally gives a new direction to the spirits, and
changes the disposition; as on the contrary, when the mind fixes constantly on
the same object, or passes easily and insensibly along related objects, the
disposition has a much longer duration. Hence it happens, that when the mind is
once inliven'd by a present impression, it proceeds to form a more lively idea
of the related objects, by a natural transition of the disposition from the one
to the other. The change of the objects is so easy, that the mind is scarce
sensible of it, but  applies itself to the conception of the related idea with
all the force and vivacity it acquir'd from the present impression.

{#3,pages=99} ^If^ in considering the nature of relation, and that facility of
transition, which is essential to it, we can satisfy ourselves concerning the
reality of this ph{ae}nomenon, 'tis well: But I must confess I place my chief
confidence in experience to prove so material a principle. We may, therefore,
observe, as the first experiment to our present purpose, that upon the
appearance of the picture of an absent friend, our idea of him is evidently
inliven'd by the _resemblance_, and that every passion, which that idea
occasions, whether of joy or sorrow, acquires new force and vigour. In producing
this effect there concur both a relation and a present impression. Where the
picture bears him no resemblance, or at least was not intended for him, it never
so much as conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the
person; tho' the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of the other;
it feels its idea to be rather weaken'd than inliven'd by that transition. We
take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend, when 'tis set before us; but
when 'tis remov'd, rather choose to consider him directly, than by reflexion in
an image, which is equally distant and obscure.

{#4,pages=99-100} ^The^ ceremonies of the _Roman Catholic_ religion may be
consider'd as experiments of the same nature. The devotees of that strange
superstition usually plead in excuse of the |mummeries, with which they are
upbraided, that they feel the good effect of those external motions, and
postures, and actions, in inlivening their devotion, and quickening their
fervour, which otherwise wou'd decay away, if directed entirely to distant and
immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in
sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the immediate
presence of these types, than 'tis possible for us to do, merely by an
intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible objects have always a greater
influence on the fancy than any other; and this influence they readily convey to
those ideas, to which they are related, and which they resemble. I shall only
infer from these practices, and this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance
in inlivening the idea is very common; and as in every case a resemblance and a
present impression must concur, we are abundantly supply'd with experiments to
prove the reality of the foregoing principle.

{#5,pages=100} ^We^ may add force to these experiments by others of a different
kind, in considering the effects of _contiguity_, as well as of _resemblance_.
'Tis certain, that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and that upon
our approach to any object; tho' it does not discover itself to our senses; it
operates upon the mind with an influence that imitates an immediate
impression{++[n21]++}. The thinking on any object readily transports the mind to
what is contiguous; but 'tis only the actual presence of an object, that
transports it with a superior vivacity. When I am a few miles from home,
whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues
distant; tho' even at that distance the reflecting on any thing in the
neighbourhood of my friends and family naturally produces an idea of them. But
as in this latter case, both the objects of the mind are ideas; not-withstanding
there is an easy transition betwixt them; that transition alone is not able to
give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate
impression.

{#6,pages=100-1} ^No^ one can doubt but causation has the same influence as |the
other two relations of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are fond
of the relicts of saints and holy men, for the same reason that they seek after
types and images, in order to inliven their devotion, and give them a more
intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives, which they desire to
imitate. Now 'tis evident, one of the best relicks a devotee cou'd procure,
wou'd be the handy-work of a saint; and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to
be consider'd in this light, 'tis because they were once at his disposal, and
were mov'd and affected by him; in which respect they are to be consider'd as
imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a shorter chain of consequences
than any of those, from which we learn the reality of his existence. This
ph{ae}nomenon clearly proves, that a present impression with a relation of
causation may enliven any idea, and consequently produce belief or assent,
according to the precedent definition of it.

{#7,pages=101} ^But^ why need we seek for other arguments to prove, that a
present impression with a relation or transition of the fancy may inliven any
idea, when this very instance of our reasonings from cause and effect will alone
suffice to that purpose? 'Tis certain we must have an idea of every matter of
fact, which we believe. 'Tis certain, that this idea arises only from a relation
to a present impression. 'Tis certain, that the belief super-adds nothing to the
idea, but only changes our manner of conceiving it, and renders it more strong
and lively. The present conclusion concerning the influence of relation is the
immediate consequence of all these steps; and every step appears to me sure and
infallible. There enters nothing into this operation of the mind but a present
impression, a lively idea, and a relation or association in the fancy betwixt
the impression and idea; so that there can be no suspicion of mistake.

{#8,pages=101-2} ^In^ order to put this whole affair in a fuller light, let us
consider it as a question in natural philosophy, which we must determine by
experience and observation. I suppose there |is an object presented, from which
I draw a certain conclusion, and form to myself ideas, which I am said to
believe or assent to. Here 'tis evident, that however that object, which is
present to my senses, and that other, whose existence I infer by reasoning, may
be thought to influence each other by their particular powers or qualities; yet
as the ph{ae}nomenon of belief, which we at present examine, is merely internal,
these powers and qualities, being entirely unknown, can have no hand in
producing it. 'Tis the present impression, which is to be consider'd as the true
and real cause of the idea, and of the belief which attends it. We must
therefore endeavour to discover by experiments the particular qualities, by
which 'tis enabled to produce so extraordinary an effect.

{#9,pages=102} ^First^ then I observe, that the present impression has not this
effect by its own proper power and efficacy, and when consider'd alone, as a
single perception, limited to the present moment. I find, that an impression,
from which, on its first appearance, I can draw no conclusion, may afterwards
become the foundation of belief, when I have had experience of its usual
consequences. We must in every case have observ'd the same impression in past
instances, and have found it to be constantly conjoin'd with some other
impression. This is confirm'd by such a multitude of experiments, that it admits
not of the smallest doubt.

{#10,pages=102-3} ^From^ a second observation I conclude, that the belief, which
attends the present impression, and is produc'd by a number of past impressions
and conjunctions; that this belief, I say, arises immediately, without any new
operation of the reason or imagination. Of this I can be certain, because I
never am conscious of any such operation, and find nothing in the subject, on
which it can be founded. Now as we call every thing ^custom^, which proceeds
from a past repetition, without any new reasoning or conclusion, we may
establish it as a certain truth, that all the belief, which follows upon any
present impression, is deriv'd solely from that origin. When we are accustom'd
to see two im|pressions conjoin'd together, the appearance or idea of the one
immediately carries us to the idea of the other.

{#11,pages=103} ^Being^ fully satisfy'd on this head, I make a third set of
experiments, in order to know, whether any thing be requisite, beside the
customary transition, towards the production of this ph{ae}nomenon of belief. I
therefore change the first impression into an idea; and observe, that tho' the
customary transition to the correlative idea still remains, yet there is in
reality no belief nor perswasion. A present impression, then, is absolutely
requisite to this whole operation; and when after this I compare an impression
with an idea, and find that their only difference consists in their different
degrees of force and vivacity, I conclude upon the whole, that belief is a more
vivid and intense conception of an idea, proceeding from its relation to a
present impression.

{#12,pages=103} ^Thus^ all probable reasoning is nothing but a species of
sensation. 'Tis not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and
sentiment, but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinc'd of any principle,
'tis only an idea, which strikes more strongly upon me. When I give the
preference to one set of arguments above another, I do nothing but decide from
my feeling concerning the superiority of their influence. Objects have no
discoverable connexion together; nor is it from any other principle but custom
operating upon the imagination, that we can draw any inference from the
appearance of one to the existence of another.

{#13,pages=103-4} '^Twill^ here be worth our observation, that the past
experience, on which all our judgments concerning cause and effect depend, may
operate on our mind in such an insensible manner as never to be taken notice of,
and may even in some measure be unknown to us. A person, who stops short in his
journey upon meeting a river in his way, foresees the consequences of his
proceeding forward; and his knowledge of these consequences is convey'd to him
by past experience, which informs him of such certain conjunctions of causes and
effects. But can we think, that on this occasion he reflects  |on any past
experience, and calls to remembrance instances, that he has seen or heard of, in
order to discover the effects of water on animal bodies? No surely; this is not
the method, in which he proceeds in his reasoning. The idea of sinking is so
closely connected with that of water, and the idea of suffocating with that of
sinking, that the mind makes the transition without the assistance of the
memory. The custom operates before we have time for reflection. The objects seem
so inseparable, that we interpose not a moment's delay in passing from the one
to the other. But as this transition proceeds from experience, and not from any
primary connexion betwixt the ideas, we must necessarily acknowledge, that
experience may produce a belief and a judgment of causes and effects by a secret
operation, and without being once thought of. This removes all pretext, if there
yet remains any, for asserting that the mind is convinc'd by reasoning of that
principle, _that instances of which we have no experience, must necessarily
resemble those, of which we have_. For we here find, that the understanding or
imagination can draw inferences from past experience, without reflecting on it;
much more without forming any principle concerning it, or reasoning upon that
principle.

{#14,pages=104-5} ^In^ general we may observe, that in all the most establish'd
and uniform conjunctions of causes and effects, such as those of gravity,
impulse, solidity, &c. the mind never carries its view expressly to consider any
past experience: Tho' in other associations of objects, which are more rare and
unusual, it may assist the custom and transition of ideas by this reflection.
Nay we find in some cases, that the reflection produces the belief without the
custom; or more properly speaking, that the reflection produces the custom in an
_oblique_ and _artificial_ manner. I explain myself. 'Tis certain, that not only
in philosophy, but even in common life, we may attain the knowledge of a
particular cause merely by one experiment, provided it be made with judgment,
and after a careful removal of all foreign and superfluous circumstances. |Now
as after one experiment of this kind, the mind, upon the appearance either of
the cause or the effect, can draw an inference concerning the existence of its
correlative; and as a habit can never be acquir'd merely by one instance; it may
be thought, that belief cannot in this case be esteem'd the effect of custom.
But this difficulty will vanish, if we consider, that tho' we are here suppos'd
to have had only one experiment of a particular effect, yet we have many
millions to convince us of this principle; _that like objects, plac'd in like
circumstances, will always produce like effects_; and as this principle has
establish'd itself by a sufficient custom, it bestows an evidence and firmness
on any opinion, to which it can be apply'd. The connexion of the ideas is not
habitual after one experiment; but this connexion is comprehended under another
principle, that is habitual; which brings us back to our hypothesis. In all
cases we transfer our experience to instances, of which we have no experience,
either _expressly_ or _tacitly_, either _directly_ or _indirectly_.

{#15,pages=105-6} ^I must^ not conclude this subject without observing, that
'tis very difficult to talk of the operations of the mind with perfect propriety
and exactness; because common language has seldom made any very nice
distinctions among them, but has generally call'd by the same term all such as
nearly resemble each other. And as this is a source almost inevitable of
obscurity and confusion in the author; so it may frequently give rise to doubts
and objections in the reader, which otherwise he wou'd never have dream'd of.
Thus my general position, that an opinion or belief is _nothing but a strong and
lively idea deriv'd from a present impression related to it_, may be liable to
the following objection, by reason of a little ambiguity in those words _strong
and lively_. It may be said, that not only an impression may give rise to
reasoning, but that an idea may also have the same influence; especially upon my
principle, _that all our ideas are deriv'd from correspondent impressions_. For
suppose I form at present an idea, of which I have forgot the correspondent
im|pression, I am able to conclude from this idea, that such an impression did
once exist; and as this conclusion is attended with belief, it may be ask'd,
from whence are the qualities of force and vivacity deriv'd, which constitute
this belief? And to this I answer very readily, _from the present idea_. For as
this idea is not here consider'd, as the representation of any absent object,
but as a real perception in the mind, of which we are intimately conscious, it
must be able to bestow on whatever is related to it the same quality, call it
_firmness, or solidity, or force, or vivacity_, with which the mind reflects
upon it, and is assur'd of its present existence. The idea here supplies the
place of an impression, and is entirely the same, so far as regards our present
purpose.

{#16,pages=106} ^Upon^ the same principles we need not be surpriz'd to hear of
the remembrance of an idea; that is, of the idea of an idea, and of its force
and vivacity superior to the loose conceptions of the imagination. In thinking
of our past thoughts we not only delineate out the objects, of which we were
thinking, but also conceive the action of the mind in the meditation, that
certain _je-ne-scai-quoi_, of which 'tis impossible to give any definition or
description, but which every one sufficiently understands. When the memory
offers an idea of this, and represents it as past, 'tis easily conceiv'd how
that idea may have more vigour and firmness, than when we think of a past
thought, of which we have no remembrance.

{#17,pages=106} ^After^ this any one will understand how we may form the idea of
an impression and of an idea, and how we may believe the existence of an
impression and of an idea.
