£4 _Of the impressions of the senses and memory._ £4

{#1,pages=84} IN this kind of reasoning, then, from causation, we employ
materials, which are of a mix'd and heterogeneous nature, and which, however
connected, are yet essentially different from each other. All our arguments
concerning causes and effects consist both of an impression of the memory or
senses, and of the idea of that existence, which produces the object of the
impression, or is produc'd by it. Here therefore we have three things to
explain, _viz. First_, The original impression. _Secondly_, The transition to
the idea of the connected cause or effect. _Thirdly_, The nature and qualities
of that idea.

{#2,pages=84} ^As^ to those _impressions_, which arise from the _senses_, their
ultimate cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and
'twill always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise
immediately from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind,
or are deriv'd from the author of our being. Nor is such a question any way
material to our present purpose. We may draw inferences from the coherence of
our perceptions, whether they be true or false; whether they represent nature
justly, or be mere illusions of the senses.

{#3,pages=85} ^When^ we search for the characteristic, which distinguishes the
_memory_ from the imagination, we must immediately perceive, that it cannot lie
in the simple ideas it presents to us; since both these faculties borrow their
simple ideas from the impressions, and can never go beyond these original
perceptions. These faculties are as little distinguish'd from each other by the
arrangement of their complex ideas. For tho' it be a peculiar property of the
memory to preserve the original order and position of its ideas, while the
imagination transposes and changes them, as it pleases; yet this difference is
not sufficient to distinguish them in their operation, or make us know the one
from the other; it being impossible to recal the past impressions, in order to
compare them with our present ideas, and see whether their arrangement be
exactly similar. Since therefore the memory is known, neither by the order of
its _complex_ ideas, nor the nature of its _simple_ ones; it follows, that the
difference betwixt it and the imagination lies in its superior force and
vivacity. A man may indulge his fancy in feigning any past scene of adventures;
nor wou'd there be any possibility of distinguishing this from a remembrance of
a like kind, were not the ideas of the imagination fainter and more obscure.

{#4,pages=627-8} {++^It^ frequently happens, that when two men have been engag'd
in any scene of action, the one shall remember it much better than the other,
and shall have all the difficulty in the world to make his companion recollect
it. He runs over several circumstances in vain; mentions the time, the place,
|the company, what was said, what was done on all sides; till at last he hits on
some lucky circumstance, that revives the whole, and gives his friend a perfect
memory of every thing. Here the person that forgets receives at first all the
ideas from the discourse of the other, with the same circumstances of time and
place; tho' he considers them as mere fictions of the imagination. But as soon
as the circumstance is mention'd, that touches the memory, the very same ideas
now appear in a new light, and have, in a manner, a different feeling from what
they had before. Without any other alteration, beside that of the feeling, they
become immediately ideas of the memory, and are assented to.++}

{#5,pages=628/85-6} {++^Since^, therefore, the imagination can represent all
the same objects that the memory can offer to us, and since those faculties are
only distinguish'd by the different _feeling_ of the ideas they present, it may
be proper to consider what is the nature of that feeling. And here I believe
every one will readily agree with me, that the ideas of the memory are more
_strong_ and _lively_ than those of the fancy. ++}|A painter, who intended to
represent a passion or emotion of any kind, wou'd endeavour to get a sight of a
person actuated by a like emotion, in order to enliven his ideas, and give them
a force and vivacity superior to what is found in those, which are mere fictions
of the imagination. The more recent this memory is, the clearer is the idea; and
when after a long interval he would return to the contemplation of his object,
he always finds its idea to be much decay'd, if not wholly obliterated. We are
frequently in doubt concerning the ideas of the memory, as they become very weak
and feeble; and are at a loss to determine whether any image proceeds from the
fancy or the memory, when it is not drawn in such lively colours as distinguish
that latter faculty. I think, I remember such an event, says one; but am not
|sure. A long tract of time has almost worn {++it++} out of my memory, and
leaves me uncertain whether or not it be the pure offspring of my fancy.

{#6,pages=86} ^And^ as an idea of the memory, by losing its force and vivacity,
may degenerate to such a degree, as to be taken for an idea of the imagination;
so on the other hand an idea of the imagination may acquire such a force and
vivacity, as to pass for an idea of the memory, and counterfeit its effects on
the belief and judgment. This is noted in the case of liars; who by the frequent
repetition of their lies, come at last to believe and remember them, as
realities; custom and habit having in this case, as in many others, the same
influence on the mind as nature, and infixing the idea with equal force and
vigour.

{#7,pages=86} ^Thus^ it appears, that the _belief_ or _assent_, which always
attends the memory and senses, is nothing but the vivacity of those perceptions
they present; and that this alone distinguishes them from the imagination. To
believe is in this case to feel an immediate impression of the senses, or a
repetition of that impression in the memory. 'Tis merely the force and
liveliness of the perception, which constitutes the first act of the judgment,
and lays the foundation of that reasoning, which we build upon it, when we trace
the relation of cause and effect.
