{#1,pages=69-70} THERE are[n15] seven different kinds of philosophical relation,
_viz. resemblance, identity, relations of time and place, proportion in quantity
or number, degrees in any quality, contrariety, and causation_. These relations
may be divided into two classes; into such as depend entirely on the ideas,
which we compare together, and such as may be chang'd without any change in the
ideas. 'Tis from the idea of a triangle, that we discover the relation of
equality, which its three angles bear to two right ones; and this relation is
invariable, as long as our idea remains the same. On the contrary, the relations
of _contiguity_ and _distance_ betwixt two objects may be chang'd merely by an
alteration of their place, without any change on the objects themselves or on
their ideas; and the place {--it--} depends on a hundred different accidents,
which cannot be foreseen by the mind. 'Tis the same case with _identity_ and
_causation_. Two objects, tho' perfectly resembling each other, and even
appearing in the same place at different times, may be numerically different:
And as the power, by which one object produces another, is never discoverable
merely from their idea, 'tis evident _cause_ and _effect_ are relations, of
which we receive information from experience, and not from any abstract
reasoning or reflection. There is no single ph{ae}nomenon, even the most simple,
|which can be accounted for from the qualities of the objects, as they appear to
us; or which we cou'd foresee without the help of our memory and experience.

{#2,pages=70} ^It^ appears, therefore, that of these seven philosophical
relations, there remain only four, which depending solely upon ideas, can be the
objects of knowledge and certainty. These four are _resemblance, contrariety,
degrees in quality, and  proportions in quantity or number_. Three of these
relations are discoverable at first sight, and fall more properly under the
province of intuition than demonstration. When any objects _resemble_ each
other, the resemblance will at first strike the eye, or rather the mind; and
seldom requires a second examination. The case is the same with _contrariety_,
and with the _degrees_ of any _quality_. No one can once doubt but existence and
non-existence destroy each other, and are perfectly incompatible and contrary.
And tho' it be impossible to judge exactly of the degrees of any quality, such
as colour, taste, heat, cold, when the difference betwixt them is very small;
yet 'tis easy to decide, that any of them is superior or inferior to another,
when their difference is considerable. And this decision we always pronounce at
first sight, without any enquiry or reasoning.

{#3,pages=70} ^We^ might proceed, after the same manner, in fixing the
_proportions_ of _quantity_ or _number_, and might at one view observe a
superiority or inferiority betwixt any numbers, or figures; especially where the
difference is very great and remarkable. As to equality or any exact proportion,
we can only guess at it from a single consideration; except in very short
numbers, or very limited portions of extension; which are comprehended in an
instant, and where we perceive an impossibility of falling into any considerable
error. In all other cases we must settle the proportions with some liberty, or
proceed in a more _artificial_ manner.

{#4,pages=70-1} ^I have^ already observ'd, that geometry, or the _art_, by which
we fix the proportions of figures; tho' it much excels both in universality and
exactness, the loose judgments of |the senses and imagination; yet never attains
a perfect precision and exactness. It's first principles are still drawn from
the general appearance of the objects; and that appearance can never afford us
any security, when we examine the prodigious minuteness of which nature is
susceptible. Our ideas seem to give a perfect assurance, that no two right lines
can have a common segment; but if we consider these ideas, we shall find, that
they always suppose a sensible inclination of the two lines, and that where the
angle they form is extremely small, we have no standard of a right line so
precise as to assure us of the truth of this proposition. 'Tis the same case
with most of the primary decisions of the mathematics.

{#5,pages=71} ^There^ remain, therefore, algebra and arithmetic as the only
sciences, in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of
intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and  certainty. We are possest
of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of
numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine
their relations, without any possibility of error. When two numbers are so
combin'd, as that the one has always an unite answering to every unite of the
other, we pronounce them equal; and 'tis for want of such a standard of equality
in extension, that geometry can scarce be esteem'd a perfect and infallible
science.

{#6,pages=71-2} ^But^ here it may not be amiss to obviate a difficulty, which
may arise from my asserting, that tho' geometry falls short of that perfect
precision and certainty, which are peculiar to arithmetic and algebra, yet it
excels the imperfect judgments of our senses and imagination. The reason why I
impute any defect to geometry, is, because its original and fundamental
principles are deriv'd merely from appearances; and it may perhaps be imagin'd,
that this defect must always attend it, and keep it from ever reaching a greater
exactness in the comparison of objects or ideas, than what our eye or
imagination alone is able to attain. I own that this defect so |far attends it,
as to keep it from ever aspiring to a full certainty: But since these
fundamental principles depend on the easiest and least deceitful appearances,
they bestow on their consequences a degree of exactness, of which these
consequences are singly incapable. 'Tis impossible for the eye to determine the
angles of a chiliagon to be equal to 1996 right angles, or make any conjecture,
that approaches this proportion; but when it determines, that right lines cannot
concur; that we cannot draw more than one right line between two given points;
it's mistakes can never be of any consequence. And this is the nature and use of
geometry, to run us up to such appearances, as, by reason of their simplicity,
cannot lead us into any considerable error.

{#7,pages=72-3} ^I shall^ here take occasion to propose a second observation
concerning our demonstrative reasonings, which is suggested by the same subject
of the mathematics. 'Tis usual with mathematicians, to pretend, that those
ideas, which are their objects, are of so refin'd and spiritual a nature, that
they fall not under the conception of the fancy, but must be comprehended by a
pure and intellectual view, of which the superior faculties of the soul are
alone capable. The same notion runs thro' most parts of philosophy, and is
principally made use of to explain our abstract ideas, and to shew how we can
form an idea of a triangle, for instance, which shall neither be an isosceles
nor scalenum, nor be confin'd to any particular length and proportion of sides.
'Tis easy to see, why philosophers are so fond of this notion of some spiritual
and refin'd perceptions; since by that means they cover many of their
absurdities, and may refuse to submit to the decisions of clear ideas, by
appealing to such as are obscure and uncertain. But to destroy this artifice, we
need but reflect on that principle so oft insisted on, _that all our ideas are
copy'd from our impressions_. For from thence we may immediately conclude, that
since all impressions are clear and precise, the ideas, which are copy'd from
them, must be of the same nature, and can never, but from our fault, con|tain
any thing so dark and intricate. An idea is by its very nature weaker and
fainter than an impression; but being in every other respect the same, cannot
imply any very great mystery. If its weakness render it obscure, 'tis our
business to remedy that defect, as much as possible, by keeping the idea steady
and precise; and till we have done so, 'tis in vain to pretend to reasoning and
philosophy.
