£4 _Of personal identity._ £4

{#1,pages=251} THERE are some philosophers, who imagine we are every moment
intimately conscious of what we call our ^Self^; that we feel its existence and
its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a
demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity. The strongest
sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead of distracting us from
this view, only fix it the more intensely, and make us consider their influence
on _self_ either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a farther proof of this
were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be deriv'd from any fact, of
which we are so intimately conscious; nor is there any thing, of which we can be
certain, if we doubt of this.

{#2,pages=251-2} ^Unluckily^ all these positive assertions are contrary to that
very experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of _self_,
after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what impression cou'd this idea
be deriv'd? This question 'tis impossible to answer without a manifest
contradiction and absurdity; and yet 'tis a question, which must necessarily be
answer'd, if we wou'd have the idea of self pass for clear and intelligible. It
must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea. But self or
person is not any one impression, but that to which our several impressions and
ideas are suppos'd to have a reference. If any impression gives rise to the idea
of self, that impression must continue invariably the same, thro' the whole
course of our lives; since self is suppos'd to exist after that manner. But
there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain |and pleasure, grief and
joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same
time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these impressions, or from any other,
that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently there is no such idea.

{#3,pages=252} ^But^ farther, what must become of all our particular perceptions
upon this hypothesis? All these are different, and distinguishable, and
separable from each other, and may be separately consider'd, and may exist
separately, and have no need of any thing to support their existence. After what
manner, therefore, do they belong to self; and how are they connected with it?
For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call _myself_, I always
stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade,
love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch _myself_ at any time without
a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my
perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible
of _myself_, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions
remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor
hate after the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely annihilated, nor do
I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one
upon serious and unprejudic'd reflection, thinks he has a different notion of
_himself_, I must confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him
is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially
different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and
continu'd, which he calls _himself_; tho' I am certain there is no such
principle in me.

{#4,pages=252-3} ^But^ setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may
venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or
collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an
inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes
cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions. Our thought |is
still more variable than our sight; and all our other senses and faculties
contribute to this change; nor is there any single power of the soul, which
remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment. The mind is a kind of
theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass,
re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and
situations. There is properly no _simplicity_ in it at one time, nor _identity_
in different; whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity
and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the
successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most
distant notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the
materials, of which it is compos'd.

{#5,pages=253} ^What^ then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity
to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an
invariable and uninterrupted existence thro' the whole course of our lives? In
order to answer this question, we must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as
it regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the
concern we take in ourselves. The first is our present subject; and to explain
it perfectly we must take the matter pretty deep, and account for that identity,
which we attribute to plants and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt
it, and the identity of a self or person.

{#6,pages=253-5} ^We^ have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable
and uninterrupted thro' a suppos'd variation of time; and this idea we call that
of _identity_ or _sameness_. We have also a distinct idea of several different
objects existing in succession, and connected together by a close relation; and
this to an accurate view affords as perfect a notion of _diversity_, as if there
was no manner of relation among the objects. But tho' these two ideas of
identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves perfectly
distinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our common way of
thinking they are generally confounded with each other. That action |of the
imagination, by which we consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and
that by which we reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the
same to the feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought requir'd in the
latter case than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the
mind from one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it
contemplated one continu'd object. This resemblance is the cause of the
confusion and mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead
of that of related objects. However at one instant we may consider the related
succession as variable or interrupted, we are sure the next to ascribe to it a
perfect identity, and regard it as invariable and uninterrupted. Our propensity
to this mistake is so great from the resemblance above-mention'd, that we fall
into it before we are aware; and tho' we incessantly correct ourselves by
reflection, and return to a more accurate method of thinking, yet we cannot long
sustain our philosophy, or take off this biass from the imagination. Our last
resource is to yield to it, and boldly assert that these different related
objects are in effect the same, however interrupted and variable. In order to
justify to ourselves this absurdity, we often feign some new and unintelligible
principle, that connects the objects together, and prevents their interruption
or variation. Thus we feign the continu'd existence of the perceptions of our
senses, to remove the interruption; and run into the notion of a _soul_, and
_self_, and _substance_, to disguise the variation. But we may farther observe,
that where we do not give rise to such a fiction, our propension to confound
identity with relation is so great, that we are apt to imagine[n50] something
unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their relation; and this I
take to be the case |with regard to the identity we ascribe to plants and
vegetables. And even when this does not take place, we still feel a propensity
to confound these ideas, tho' we are not able fully to satisfy ourselves in that
particular, nor find any thing invariable and uninterrupted to justify our
notion of identity.

{#7,pages=255} ^Thus^ the controversy concerning identity is not merely a
dispute of words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper sense, to
variable or interrupted objects, our mistake is not confin'd to the expression,
but is commonly attended with a fiction, either of something invariable and
uninterrupted, or of something mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a
propensity to such fictions. What will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the
satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to shew from daily experience and
observation, that the objects, which are variable or interrupted, and yet are
suppos'd to continue the same, are such only as consist of a succession of
parts, connected together by resemblance, contiguity, or causation. For as such
a succession answers evidently to our notion of diversity, it can only be by
mistake we ascribe to it an identity; and as the relation of parts, which leads
us into this mistake, is really nothing but a quality, which produces an
association of ideas, and an easy transition of the imagination from one to
another, it can only be from the resemblance, which this act of the mind bears
to that, by which we contemplate one continu'd object, that the error arises.
Our chief business, then, must be to prove, that all objects, to which we
ascribe identity, without observing their invariableness and uninterruptedness,
are such as consist of a succession of related objects.

{#8,pages=255-6} ^In^ order to this, suppose any mass of matter, of which the
parts are contiguous and connected, to be plac'd before us; 'tis plain we must
attribute a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the parts continue
uninterruptedly and invariably the same, whatever motion or change of place we
may observe either in the whole or in any of the parts. But supposing some very
_small_ or _inconsiderable_ part to be added |to the mass, or substracted from
it; tho' this absolutely destroys the identity of the whole, strictly speaking;
yet as we seldom think so accurately, we scruple not to pronounce a mass of
matter the same, where we find so trivial an alteration. The passage of the
thought from the object before the change to the object after it, is so smooth
and easy, that we scarce perceive the transition, and are apt to imagine, that
'tis nothing but a continu'd survey of the same object.

{#9,pages=256} ^There^ is a very remarkable circumstance, that attends this
experiment; which is, that tho' the change of any considerable part in a mass of
matter destroys the identity of the whole, yet we must measure the greatness of
the part, not absolutely, but by its _proportion_ to the whole. The addition or
diminution of a mountain wou'd not be sufficient to produce a diversity in a
planet; tho' the change of a very few inches wou'd be able to destroy the
identity of some bodies. 'Twill be impossible to account for this, but by
reflecting that objects operate upon the mind, and break or interrupt the
continuity of its actions not according to their real greatness, but according
to their proportion to each other: And therefore, since this interruption makes
an object cease to appear the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress of the
thought, which constitutes the imperfect identity.

{#10,pages=256} ^This^ may be confirm'd by another ph{ae}nomenon. A change in
any considerable part of a body destroys its identity; but 'tis remarkable, that
where the change is produc'd _gradually_ and _insensibly_ we are less apt to
ascribe to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no other, than that the
mind, in following the successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage
from the surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another,
and at no particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which
continu'd perception, it ascribes a continu'd existence and identity to the
object.

{#11,pages=257} ^But^ whatever precaution we may use in introducing the changes
gradually, and making them proportionable to the whole, 'tis certain, that where
the changes are at last observ'd to become considerable, we make a scruple of
ascribing identity to such different objects. There is, however, another
artifice, by which we may induce the imagination to advance a step farther; and
that is, by producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination
to some _common end_ or purpose. A ship, of which a considerable part has been
chang'd by frequent reparations, is still consider'd as the same; nor does the
difference of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it. The
common end, in which the parts conspire, is the same under all their variations,
and affords an easy transition of the imagination from one situation of the body
to another.

{#12,pages=257} ^But^ this is still more remarkable, when we add a _sympathy_ of
parts to their _common end_, and suppose that they bear to each other, the
reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their actions and operations.
This is the case with all animals and vegetables; where not only the several
parts have a reference to some general purpose, but also a mutual dependance on,
and connexion with each other. The effect of so strong a relation is, that tho'
every one must allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and animals
endure a _total_ change, yet we still attribute identity to them, while their
form, size, and substance are entirely alter'd. An oak, that grows from a small
plant to a large tree, is still the same oak; tho' there be not one particle of
matter, or figure of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man, and is
sometimes fat, sometimes lean, without any change in his identity.

{#13,pages=257-8} ^We^ may also consider the two following ph{ae}nomena, which
are remarkable in their kind. The first is, that tho' we commonly be able to
distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet it
sometimes happens, that we confound them, and in our thinking and reasoning
|employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who hears a noise, that is frequently
interrupted and renew'd, says, it is still the same noise; tho' 'tis evident the
sounds have only a specific identity or resemblance, and there is nothing
numerically the same, but the cause, which produc'd them. In like manner it may
be said without breach of the propriety of language, that such a church, which
was formerly of brick, fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church
of free-stone, and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor
materials are the same, nor is there any thing common to the two objects, but
their relation to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet this alone is
sufficient to make us denominate them the same. But we must observe, that in
these cases the first object is in a manner annihilated before the second comes
into existence; by which means, we are never presented in any one point of time
with the idea of difference and multiplicity; and for that reason are less
scrupulous in calling them the same.

{#14,pages=258} ^Secondly^, We may remark, that tho' in a succession of related
objects, it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden nor
entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are in their
nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden transition, than
wou'd otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus as the nature of a river
consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty
hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the
same during several ages. What is natural and essential to any thing is, in a
manner, expected; and what is expected makes less impression, and appears of
less moment, than what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change of
the former kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial
alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the thought,
has less influence in destroying the identity.

{#15,pages=259} ^We^ now proceed to explain the nature of _personal identity_,
which has become so great a question in philosophy, especially of late years in
_England_, where all the abstruser sciences are study'd with a peculiar ardour
and application. And here 'tis evident, the same method of reasoning must be
continu'd, which has so successfully explain'd the identity of plants, and
animals, and ships, and houses, and of all the compounded and changeable
productions either of art or nature. The identity, which we ascribe to the mind
of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe
to vegetables and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin,
but must proceed from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.

{#16,pages=259-60} ^But^ lest this argument shou'd not convince the reader;
tho'; in my opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning,
which is still closer and more immediate. 'Tis evident, that the identity, which
we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not
able to run the several different perceptions into one, and make them lose their
characters of distinction and difference, which are essential to them. 'Tis
still true, that every distinct perception, which enters into the composition of
the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and distinguishable, and
separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive. But,
as, notwithstanding this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole
train of perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises
concerning this relation of identity; whether it be something that really binds
our several perceptions together, or only associates their ideas in the
imagination. That is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the
identity of a person, we observe some real bond among his perceptions, or only
feel one among the ideas we form of them. This question we might easily decide,
if we wou'd recollect what has been already prov'd at large, that the
understanding never observes any real connexion among |objects, and that even
the union of cause and effect, when strictly examin'd, resolves itself into a
customary association of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that
identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and uniting
them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to them, because of
the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we reflect upon them. Now the
only qualities, which can give ideas an union in the imagination, are these
three relations above-mention'd. These are the uniting principles in the ideal
world, and without them every distinct object is separable by the mind, and may
be separately consider'd, and appears not to have any more connexion with any
other object, than if disjoin'd by the greatest difference and remoteness. 'Tis,
therefore, on some of these three relations of resemblance, contiguity and
causation, that identity depends; and as the very essence of these relations
consists in their producing an easy transition of ideas; it follows, that our
notions of personal identity, proceed entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted
progress of the thought along a train of connected ideas, according to the
principles above-explain'd.

{#17,pages=260} ^The^ only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what
relations this uninterrupted progress of our thought is produc'd, when we
consider the successive existence of a mind or thinking person. And here 'tis
evident we must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and must drop
contiguity, which has little or no influence in the present case.

{#18,pages=260-1} ^To^ begin with _resemblance_; suppose we cou'd see clearly
into the breast of another, and observe that succession of perceptions, which
constitutes his mind or thinking principle, and suppose that he always preserves
the memory of a considerable part of past perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing
cou'd more contribute to the bestowing a relation on this succession amidst all
its variations. For what {++is++} the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up
the images of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily resembles its
object, |must not the frequent placing of these resembling perceptions in the
chain of thought, convey the imagination more easily from one link to another,
and make the whole seem like the continuance of one object? In this particular,
then, the memory not only discovers the identity, but also contributes to its
production, by producing the relation of resemblance among the perceptions. The
case is the same whether we consider ourselves or others.

{#19,pages=261} ^As^ to _causation_; we may observe, that the true idea of the
human mind, is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or different
existences, which are link'd together by the relation of cause and effect, and
mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other. Our impressions
give rise to their correspondent ideas; and these ideas in their turn produce
other impressions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a third, by
which it is expell'd in its turn. In this respect, I cannot compare the soul
more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the
several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and
subordination, and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic
in the incessant changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may
not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner
the same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his
impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures,
his several parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this
view our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with
regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each
other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or
pleasures.

{#20,pages=261-2} ^As^ memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent
of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be consider'd, upon that account
chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd
have any notion of |causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and
effects, which constitute our self or person. But having once acquir'd this
notion of causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes, and
consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory, and can comprehend
times, and circumstances, and actions, which we have entirely forgot, but
suppose in general to have existed. For how few of our past actions are there,
of which we have any memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his
thoughts and actions on the first of _January_ 1715, the 11th of _March_ 1719,
and the 3d of _August_ 1733? Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot
the incidents of these days, that the present self is not the same person with
the self of that time; and by that means overturn all the most establish'd
notions of personal identity? In this view, therefore, memory does not so much
_produce_ as _discover_ personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause
and effect among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on those, who
affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity, to give a reason why
we can thus extend our identity beyond our memory.

{#21,pages=262} ^The^ whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which is
of great importance in the present affair, _viz._ that all the nice and subtile
questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be decided, and are to
be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical difficulties. Identity
depends on the relations of ideas; and these relations produce identity, by
means of that easy transition they occasion. But as the relations, and the
easiness of the transition may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just
standard, by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they
acquire or lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning the
identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except so far as the relation
of parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary principle of union, as we have
already observ'd.

{#22,pages=263} ^What^ I have said concerning the first origin and uncertainty
of our notion of identity, as apply'd to the human mind, may be extended with
little or no variation to that of _simplicity_. An object, whose different
co-existent parts are bound together by a close relation, operates upon the
imagination after much the same manner as one perfectly simple and indivisible,
and requires not a much greater stretch of thought in order to its conception.
From this similarity of operation we attribute a simplicity to it, and feign a
principle of union as the support of this simplicity, and the center of all the
different parts and qualities of the object.

{#23,pages=263} ^Thus^ we have finish'd our examination of the several systems
of philosophy, both of the intellectual and {~~moral->natural~~} world; and in
our miscellaneous way of reasoning have been led into several topics; which will
either illustrate and confirm some preceding part of this discourse, or prepare
the way for our following opinions. 'Tis now time to return to a more close
examination of our subject, and to proceed in the accurate anatomy of human
nature, having fully explain'd the nature of our judgment and understanding.

{#n50,pages=254} If the reader is desirous to see how a great genius may be
influenc'd by these seemingly trivial principles of the imagination, as well as
the mere vulgar, let him read my Lord _Shaftsbury_'s reasonings concerning the
uniting principle of the universe, and the identity of plants and animals. See
his _Moralists:_ or, _Philosophical rhapsody_.
