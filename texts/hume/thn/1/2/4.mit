{#1,pages=39} OUR system concerning space and time consists of two parts, which
are intimately connected together. The first depends on this chain of reasoning.
The capacity of the mind is not infinite; consequently no idea of extension or
duration consists of an infinite number of parts or inferior ideas, but of a
finite number, and these simple and indivisible: 'Tis therefore possible for
space and time to exist conformable to this idea: And if it be possible, 'tis
certain they actually do exist conformable to it; since their infinite
divisibility is utterly impossible and contradictory.

{#2,pages=39-40} ^The^ other part of our system is a consequence of this. The
parts, into which the ideas of space and time resolve themselves, become at last
indivisible; and these indivisible parts, being nothing in themselves, are
inconceivable when not fill'd with something real and existent. The ideas of
space and time are therefore no separate or distinct ideas, |but merely those of
the manner or order, in which objects exist: Or, in other words, 'tis impossible
to conceive either a vacuum and extension without matter, or a time, when there
was no succession or change in any real existence. The intimate connexion
betwixt these parts of our system is the reason why we shall examine together
the objections, which have been urg'd against both of them, beginning with those
against the finite divisibility of extension.

{#3,pages=40} I. ^The^ first of these objections, which I shall take notice of,
is more proper to prove this connexion and dependance of the one part upon the
other, than to destroy either of them. It has often been maintain'd in the
schools, that extension must be divisible, _in infinitum_, because the system of
mathematical points is absurd; and that system is absurd, because a mathematical
point is a non-entity, and consequently can never by its conjunction with others
form a real existence. This wou'd be perfectly decisive, were there no medium
betwixt the infinite divisibility of matter, and the non-entity of mathematical
points. But there is evidently a medium, _viz._ the bestowing a colour or
solidity on these points; and the absurdity of both the extremes is a
demonstration of the truth and reality of this medium. The system of _physical_
points, which is another medium, is too absurd to need a refutation. A real
extension, such as a physical point is suppos'd to be, can never exist without
parts, different from each other; and wherever objects are different, they are
distinguishable and separable by the imagination.

{#4,pages=40-1} II. ^The^ second objection is deriv'd from the necessity there
wou'd be of _penetration_, if extension consisted of mathematical points. A
simple and indivisible atom, that touches another, must necessarily penetrate
it; for 'tis impossible it can touch it by its external parts, from the very
supposition of its perfect simplicity, which excludes all parts. It must
therefore touch it intimately, and in its whole essence, _secundum se, tota, &
totaliter_; which is the very definition of |penetration. But penetration is
impossible: Mathematical points are of consequence equally impossible.

{#5,pages=41} ^I answer^ this objection by substituting a juster idea of
penetration. Suppose two bodies containing no void within their circumference,
to approach each other, and to unite in such a manner that the body, which
results from their union, is no more extended than either of them; 'tis this we
must mean when we talk of penetration. But 'tis evident this penetration is
nothing but the annihilation of one of these bodies, and the preservation of the
other, without our being able to distinguish particularly which is preserv'd and
which annihilated. Before the approach we have the idea of two bodies. After it
we have the idea only of one. 'Tis impossible for the mind to preserve any
notion of difference betwixt two bodies of the same nature existing in the same
place at the same time.

{#6,pages=41} ^Taking^ then penetration in this sense, for the annihilation of
one body upon its approach to another, I ask any one, if he sees a necessity,
that a colour'd or tangible point shou'd be annihilated upon the approach of
another colour'd or tangible point? On the contrary, does he not evidently
perceive, that from the union of these points there results an object, which is
compounded and divisible, and may be distinguish'd into two parts, of which each
preserves its existence distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to
the other? Let him aid his fancy by conceiving these points to be of different
colours, the better to prevent their coalition and confusion. A blue and a red
point may surely lie contiguous without any penetration or annihilation. For if
they cannot, what possibly can become of them? Whether shall the red or the blue
be annihilated? Or if these colours unite into one, what new colour will they
produce by their union?

{#7,pages=41-2} ^What^ chiefly gives rise to these objections, and at the same
time renders it so difficult to give a satisfactory answer to them, is the
natural infirmity and unsteadiness both of |our imagination and senses, when
employ'd on such minute objects. Put a spot of ink upon paper, and retire to
such a distance, that the spot becomes altogether invisible; you will find, that
upon your return and nearer approach the spot first becomes visible by short
intervals; and afterwards becomes always visible; and afterwards acquires only a
new force in its colouring without augmenting its bulk; and afterwards, when it
has encreas'd to such a degree as to be really extended, 'tis still difficult
for the imagination to break it into its component parts, because of the
uneasiness it finds in the conception of such a minute object as a single point.
This infirmity affects most of our reasonings on the present subject, and makes
it almost impossible to answer in an intelligible manner, and in proper
expressions, many questions which may arise concerning it.

{#8,pages=42} III. ^There^ have been many objections drawn from the
_mathematics_ against the indivisibility of the parts of extension; tho' at
first sight that science seems rather favourable to the present doctrine; and if
it be contrary in its _demonstrations_, 'tis perfectly conformable in its
_definitions_. My present business then must be to defend the definitions, and
refute the demonstrations.

{#9,pages=42} ^A surface^ is _defin'd_ to be length and breadth without depth: A
line to be length without breadth or depth: A point to be what has neither
length, breadth nor depth. 'Tis evident that all this is perfectly
unintelligible upon any other supposition than that of the composition of
extension by indivisible points or atoms. How else cou'd any thing exist without
length, without breadth, or without depth?

{#10,pages=42-3} ^Two^ different answers, I find, have been made to this
argument; neither of which is in my opinion satisfactory. The first is, that the
objects of geometry, those surfaces, lines and points, whose proportions and
positions it examines, are mere ideas in the mind; and not only never did, but
never can exist in nature. They never did exist; for no one will pretend to draw
a line or make a surface entirely |conformable to the definition: They never can
exist; for we may produce demonstrations from these very ideas to prove, that
they are impossible.

{#11,pages=43} ^But^ can any thing be imagin'd more absurd and contradictory
than this reasoning? Whatever can be conceiv'd by a clear and distinct idea
necessarily implies the possibility of existence; and he who pretends to prove
the impossibility of its existence by any argument deriv'd from the clear idea,
in reality asserts, that we have no clear idea of it, because we have a clear
idea. 'Tis in vain to search for a contradiction in any thing that is distinctly
conceiv'd by the mind. Did it imply any contradiction, 'tis impossible it cou'd
ever be conceiv'd.

{#12,pages=43} ^There^ is therefore no medium betwixt allowing at least the
possibility of indivisible points, and denying their idea; and 'tis on this
latter principle, that the second answer to the foregoing argument is founded.
It has been[n10] pretended, that tho' it be impossible to conceive a length
without any breadth, yet by an abstraction without a separation, we can consider
the one without regarding the other; in the same manner as we may think of the
length of the way betwixt two towns, and overlook its breadth. The length is
inseparable from the breadth both in nature and in our minds; but this excludes
not a partial consideration, and a _distinction of reason_, after the manner
above explain'd.

{#13,pages=43} ^In^ refuting this answer I shall not insist on the argument,
which I have already sufficiently explain'd, that if it be impossible for the
mind to arrive at a _minimum_ in its ideas, its capacity must be infinite, in
order to comprehend the infinite number of parts, of which its idea of any
extension wou'd be compos'd. I shall here endeavour to find some new absurdities
in this reasoning.

{#14,pages=43-4} ^A surface^ terminates a solid; a line terminates a surface; a
point terminates a line; but I assert, that if the _ideas_ of a point, line or
surface were not indivisible, 'tis impossible we |shou'd ever conceive these
terminations. For let these ideas be suppos'd infinitely divisible; and then let
the fancy endeavour to fix itself on the idea of the last surface, line or
point; it immediately finds this idea to break into parts; and upon its seizing
the last of these parts, it loses its hold by a new division, and so on _in
infinitum_, without any possibility of its arriving at a concluding idea. The
number of fractions bring it no nearer the last division, than the first idea it
form'd. Every particle eludes the grasp by a new fraction; like quicksilver,
when we endeavour to seize it. But as in fact there must be something, which
terminates the idea of every finite quantity; and as this terminating idea
cannot itself consist of parts or inferior ideas; otherwise it wou'd be the last
of its parts, which finish'd the idea, and so on; this is a clear proof, that
the ideas of surfaces, lines and points admit not of any division; those of
surfaces in depth; of lines in breadth and depth; and of points in any
dimension.

{#15,pages=44} ^The^ _schoolmen_ were so sensible of the force of this argument,
that some of them maintain'd, that nature has mix'd among those particles of
matter, which are divisible _in infinitum_, a number of mathematical points, in
order to give a termination to bodies; and others eluded the force of this
reasoning by a heap of unintelligible cavils and distinctions. Both these
adversaries equally yield the victory. A man who hides himself, confesses as
evidently the superiority of his enemy, as another, who fairly delivers his
arms.

{#16,pages=44} ^Thus^ it appears, that the definitions of mathematics destroy
the pretended demonstrations; and that if we have the idea of indivisible
points, lines and surfaces conformable to the definition, their existence is
certainly possible: but if we have no such idea, 'tis impossible we can ever
conceive the termination of any figure; without which conception there can be no
geometrical demonstration.

{#17,pages=44-5} ^But^ I go farther, and maintain, that none of these
demonstrations can have sufficient weight to establish such a |principle, as
this of infinite divisibility; and that because with regard to such minute
objects, they are not properly demonstrations, being built on ideas, which are
not exact, and maxims, which are not precisely true. When geometry decides any
thing concerning the proportions of quantity, we ought not to look for the
utmost _precision_ and exactness. None of its proofs extend so far. It takes the
dimensions and proportions of figures justly; but roughly, and with some
liberty. Its errors are never considerable; nor wou'd it err at all, did it not
aspire to such an absolute perfection.

{#18,pages=45} ^I first^ ask mathematicians, what they mean when they say one
line or surface is ^equal^ to, or ^greater^, or ^less^ than another? Let any of
them give an answer, to whatever sect he belongs, and whether he maintains the
composition of extension by indivisible points, or by quantities divisible _in
infinitum_. This question will embarrass both of them.

{#19,pages=45} ^There^ are few or no mathematicians, who defend the hypothesis
of indivisible points; and yet these have the readiest and justest answer to the
present question. They need only reply, that lines or surfaces are equal, when
the numbers of points in each are equal; and that as the proportion of the
numbers varies, the proportion of the lines and surfaces is also vary'd. But
tho' this answer be _just_, as well as obvious; yet I may affirm, that this
standard of equality is entirely _useless_, and that it never is from such a
comparison we determine objects to be equal or unequal with respect to each
other. For as the points, which enter into the composition of any line or
surface, whether perceiv'd by the sight or touch, are so minute and so
confounded with each other, that 'tis utterly impossible for the mind to compute
their number, such a computation will never afford us a standard, by which we
may judge of proportions. No one will ever be able to determine by an exact
numeration, that an inch has fewer points than a foot, or a foot fewer than an
ell or any greater measure; for which reason we seldom or never consider this as
the standard of equality or inequality.

{#20,pages=46} ^As^ to those, who imagine, that extension is divisible _in
infinitum_, 'tis impossible they can make use of this answer, or fix the
equality of any line or surface by a numeration of its component parts. For
since, according to their hypothesis, the least as well as greatest figures
contain an infinite number of parts; and since infinite numbers, properly
speaking, can neither be equal nor unequal with respect to each other; the
equality or inequality of any portions of space can never depend on any
proportion in the number of their parts. 'Tis true, it may be said, that the
inequality of an ell and a yard consists in the different numbers of the feet,
of which they are compos'd; and that of a foot and a yard in the number of the
inches. But as that quantity we call an inch in the one is suppos'd equal to
what we call an inch in the other, and as 'tis impossible for the mind to find
this equality by proceeding _in infinitum_ with these references to inferior
quantities; 'tis evident, that at last we must fix some standard of equality
different from an enumeration of the parts.

{#21,pages=46-7} ^There^ are some[n11], who pretend, that equality is best
defin'd by _congruity_, and that any two figures are equal, when upon the
placing of one upon the other, all their parts correspond to and touch each
other. In order to judge of this definition let us consider, that since equality
is a relation, it is not, strictly speaking, a property in the figures
themselves, but arises merely from the comparison, which the mind makes betwixt
them. If it consists, therefore, in this imaginary application and mutual
contact of parts, we must at least have a distinct notion of these parts, and
must conceive their contact. Now 'tis plain, that in this conception we wou'd
run up these parts to the greatest minuteness, which can possibly be conceiv'd;
since the contact of large parts wou'd never render the figures equal. But the
minutest parts we can conceive are mathematical points; and consequently this
standard of equality is the same with that deriv'd from |the equality of the
number of points, which we have already determin'd to be a just but an useless
standard. We must therefore look to some other quarter for a solution of the
present difficulty.

{#22,pages=47, 637} {~~'^Tis^ evident,->^There^ are many philosophers, who
refuse to assign any standard of _equality_, but assert, that 'tis sufficient to
present two objects, that are equal, in order to give us a just notion of this
proportion. All definitions, say they, are fruitless, without the perception of
such objects; and where we perceive such objects, we no longer stand in need of
any definition. To this reasoning I entirely agree; and assert, that the only
useful notion of equality, or inequality, is deriv'd from the whole united
appearance and the comparison of particular objects. For 'tis evident,~~} that
the eye, or rather the mind is often able at one view to determine the
proportions of bodies, and pronounce them equal to, or greater or less than each
other, without examining or comparing the number of their minute parts. Such
judgments are not only common, but in many cases certain and infallible. When
the measure of a yard and that of a foot are presented, the mind can no more
question, that the first is longer than the second, than it can doubt of those
principles, which are the most clear and self-evident.

{#23,pages=47} ^There^ are therefore three proportions, which the mind
distinguishes in the general appearance of its objects, and calls by the names
of _greater_, _less_ and _equal_. But tho' its decisions concerning these
proportions be sometimes infallible, they are not always so; nor are our
judgments of this kind more exempt from doubt and error, than those on any other
subject. We frequently correct our first opinion by a review and reflection; and
pronounce those objects to be equal, which at first we esteem'd unequal; and
regard an object as less, tho' before it appear'd greater than another. Nor is
this the only correction, which these judgments of our senses undergo; but we
often discover our error by a juxta-position of the objects; or where that is
impracticable, by the use of some common and invariable measure, which being
successively apply'd to each, informs us of their different proportions. And
even this correction is susceptible of a new correction, and of different
degrees of exactness, according to the nature of the instrument, by which we
measure the bodies, and the care which we employ in the comparison.

{#24,pages=47-9} When therefore the mind is accustom'd to these judgments and
their corrections, and finds that the same proportion which makes two figures
have in the eye that appearance, |which we call _equality_, makes them also
correspond to each other, and to any common measure, with which they are
compar'd, we form a mix'd notion of equality deriv'd both from the looser and
stricter methods of comparison. But we are not content with this. For as sound
reason convinces us that there are bodies _vastly_ more minute than those, which
appear to the senses; and as a false reason wou'd perswade us, that there are
bodies _infinitely_ more minute; we clearly perceive, that we are not possess'd
of any instrument or art of measuring, which can secure us from all error and
uncertainty. We are sensible, that the addition or removal of one of these
minute parts, is not discernible either in the appearance or measuring; and as
we imagine, that two figures, which were equal before, cannot be equal after
this removal or addition, we therefore suppose some imaginary standard of
equality, by which the appearances and measuring are exactly corrected, and the
figures reduc'd entirely to that proportion. This standard is plainly imaginary.
For as the very idea of equality is that of such a particular appearance
corrected by juxta-position or a common measure, the notion of any correction
beyond what we have instruments and art to make, is a mere fiction of the mind,
and useless as well as incomprehensible. But tho' this standard be only
imaginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor is any thing more usual,
than for the mind to proceed after this manner with any action, even after the
reason has ceas'd, which first determin'd it to begin. This appears very
conspicuously with regard to time; where tho' 'tis evident we have no exact
method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so exact as in
extension, yet the various corrections of our measures, and their different
degrees of exactness, have given us an obscure and implicit notion of a perfect
and entire equality. The case is the same in many other subjects. A musician
finding his ear become every day more delicate, and correcting himself by
reflection and attention, proceeds with the same act of the mind, even when |he
subject fails him, and entertains a notion of a compleat _tierce_ or _octave_,
without being able to tell whence he derives his standard. A painter forms the
same fiction with regard to colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. To the
one _light_ and _shade_; to the other _swift_ and _slow_ are imagin'd to be
capable of an exact comparison and equality beyond the judgments of the senses.

{#25,pages=49} ^We may^ apply the same reasoning to ^curve^ and ^right^ lines.
Nothing is more apparent to the senses, than the distinction betwixt a curve and
a right line; nor are there any ideas we more easily form than the ideas of
these objects. But however easily we may form these ideas, 'tis impossible to
produce any definition of them, which will fix the precise boundaries betwixt
them. When we draw lines upon paper or any continu'd surface, there is a certain
order, by which the lines run along from one point to another, that they may
produce the entire impression of a curve or right line; but this order is
perfectly unknown, and nothing is observ'd but the united appearance. Thus even
upon the system of indivisible points, we can only form a distant notion of some
unknown standard to these objects. Upon that of infinite divisibility we cannot
go even this length; but are reduc'd meerly to the general appearance, as the
rule by which we determine lines to be either curve or right ones. But tho' we
can give no perfect definition of these lines, nor produce any very exact method
of distinguishing the one from the other; yet this hinders us not from
correcting the first appearance by a more accurate consideration, and by a
comparison with some rule, of whose rectitude from repeated trials we have a
greater assurance. And 'tis from these corrections, and by carrying on the same
action of the mind, even when its reason fails us, that we form the loose idea
of a perfect standard to these figures, without being able to explain or
comprehend it.

{#26,pages=49-50} '^Tis^ true, mathematicians pretend they give an exact
definition of a right line, when they say, _it is the shortest way |betwixt two
points_. But in the first place I observe, that this is more properly the
discovery of one of the properties of a right line, than a just definition of
it. For I ask any one, if upon mention of a right line he thinks not immediately
on such a particular appearance, and if 'tis not by accident only that he
considers this property? A right line can be comprehended alone; but this
definition is unintelligible without a comparison with other lines, which we
conceive to be more extended. In common life 'tis establish'd as a maxim, that
the streightest way is always the shortest; which wou'd be as absurd as to say,
the shortest way is always the shortest, if our idea of a right line was not
different from that of the shortest way betwixt two points.

{#27,pages=50} ^Secondly^, I repeat what I have already establish'd, that we
have no precise idea of equality and inequality, shorter and longer, more than
of a right line or a curve; and consequently that the one can never afford us a
perfect standard for the other. An exact idea can never be built on such as are
loose and undeterminate.

{#28,pages=50} ^The^ idea of a _plain surface_ is as little susceptible of a
precise standard as that of a right line; nor have we any other means of
distinguishing such a surface, than its general appearance. 'Tis in vain, that
mathematicians represent a plain surface as produc'd by the flowing of a right
line. 'Twill immediately be objected, that our idea of a surface is as
independent of this method of forming a surface, as our idea of an ellipse is of
that of a cone; that the idea of a right line is no more precise than that of a
plain surface; that a right line may flow irregularly, and by that means form a
figure quite different from a plane; and that therefore we must suppose it to
flow along two right lines, parallel to each other, and on the same plane; which
is a description, that explains a thing by itself, and returns in a circle.

{#29,pages=50-1} ^It^ appears, then, that the ideas which are most essential to
geometry, _viz._ those of equality and inequality, of a right line and a plain
surface, are far from being exact and |determinate, according to our common
method of conceiving them. Not only we are incapable of telling, if the case be
in any degree doubtful, when such particular figures are equal; when such a line
is a right one, and such a surface a plain one; but we can form no idea of that
proportion, or of these figures, which is firm and invariable. Our appeal is
still to the weak and fallible judgment, which we make from the appearance of
the objects, and correct by a compass or common measure; and if we join the
supposition of any farther correction, 'tis of such-a-one as is either useless
or imaginary. In vain shou'd we have recourse to the common topic, and employ
the supposition of a deity, whose omnipotence may enable him to form a perfect
geometrical figure, and describe a right line without any curve or inflexion. As
the ultimate standard of these figures is deriv'd from nothing but the senses
and imagination, 'tis absurd to talk of any perfection beyond what these
faculties can judge of; since the true perfection of any thing consists in its
conformity to its standard.

{#30,pages=51-2} ^Now^ since these ideas are so loose and uncertain, I wou'd
fain ask any mathematician what infallible assurance he has, not only of the
more intricate and obscure propositions of his science, but of the most vulgar
and obvious principles? How can he prove to me, for instance, that two right
lines cannot have one common segment? Or that 'tis impossible to draw more than
one right line betwixt any two points? Shou'd he tell me, that these opinions
are obviously absurd, and repugnant to our clear ideas; I wou'd answer, that I
do not deny, where two right lines incline upon each other with a sensible
angle, but 'tis absurd to imagine them to have a common segment. But supposing
these two lines to approach at the rate of an inch in twenty leagues, I perceive
no absurdity in asserting, that upon their contact they become one. For, I
beseech you, by what rule or standard do you judge, when you assert, that the
line, in which I have suppos'd them to concur, cannot make the same right line
|with those two, that form so small an angle betwixt them? You must surely have
some idea of a right line, to which this line does not agree. Do you therefore
mean, that it takes not the points in the same order and by the same rule, as is
peculiar and essential to a right line? If so, I must inform you, that besides
that in judging after this manner you allow, that extension is compos'd of
indivisible points (which, perhaps, is more than you intend) besides this, I
say, I must inform you, that neither is this the standard from which we form the
idea of a right line; nor, if it were, is there any such firmness in our senses
or imagination, as to determine when such an order is violated or preserv'd. The
original standard of a right line is in reality nothing but a certain general
appearance; and 'tis evident right lines may be made to concur with each other,
and yet correspond to this standard, tho' corrected by all the means either
practicable or imaginable.

{#31,pages=638} {++^To^ whatever side mathematicians turn, this dilemma still
meets them. If they judge of equality, or any other proportion, by the accurate
and exact standard, _viz_. the enumeration of the minute indivisible parts, they
both employ a standard, which is useless in practice, and actually establish the
indivisibility of extension, which they endeavour to explode. Or if they employ,
as is usual, the inaccurate standard, deriv'd from a comparison of objects, upon
their general appearance, corrected by measuring and juxta position; their first
principles, tho' certain and infallible, are too coarse to afford any such
subtile inferences as they commonly draw from them. The first principles are
founded on the imagination and senses: The conclusion, therefore, can never go
beyond, much less contradict these faculties.++}

{#32,pages=52} ^This^ may open our eyes a little, and let us see, that no
geometrical demonstration for the infinite divisibility of extension can have so
much force as what we naturally attribute to every argument, which is supported
by such magnificent pretensions. At the same time we may learn the reason, why
geometry fails of evidence in this single point, while all its other reasonings
command our fullest assent and approbation. And indeed it seems more requisite
to give the reason of this exception, than to shew, that we really must make
such an exception, and regard all the mathematical arguments for infinite
divisibility as utterly sophistical. For 'tis evident, that as no idea of
quantity is infinitely divisible, there cannot be imagin'd a more glaring
absurdity, than to endeavour to prove, that quantity itself admits of such a
division; and to prove this by means of ideas, which are directly opposite in
that particular. And as this absurdity is very glaring in itself, so there is no
argument founded on it, which is not attended with a new absurdity, and involves
not an evident contradiction.

{#33,pages=53} ^I might^ give as instances those arguments for infinite
divisibility, which are deriv'd from the _point of contact_. I know there is no
mathematician, who will not refuse to be judg'd by the diagrams he describes
upon paper, these being loose draughts, as he will tell us, and serving only to
convey with greater facility certain ideas, which are the true foundation of all
our reasoning. This I am satisfy'd with, and am willing to rest the controversy
merely upon these ideas. I desire therefore our mathematician to form, as
accurately as possible, the ideas of a circle and a right line; and I then ask,
if upon the conception of their contact he can conceive them as touching in a
mathematical point, or if he must necessarily imagine them to concur for some
space. Whichever side he chuses, he runs himself into equal difficulties. If he
affirms, that in tracing these figures in his imagination, he can imagine them
to touch only in a point, he allows the possibility of that idea, and
consequently of the thing. If he says, that in his conception of the contact of
those lines he must make them concur, he thereby acknowledges the fallacy of
geometrical demonstrations, when carry'd beyond a certain degree of minuteness;
since 'tis certain he has such demonstrations against the concurrence of a
circle and a right line; that is, in other words, he can prove an idea, _viz._
that of concurrence, to be _incompatible_ with two other ideas, _viz._ those of
a circle and right line;  tho' at the same time he acknowledges these ideas to
be _inseparable_.
