{#1,pages=8-9} WE find by experience, that when any impression has been present
with the mind, it again makes its appearance there as an idea; and this it may
do after two different ways: either when in its new appearance it retains a
considerable degree of its first vivacity, and is somewhat intermediate betwixt
an impression and an idea; or when it intirely loses that vivacity, and is a
perfect idea. The faculty, by which we repeat our impressions in the first
manner, is called the ^Memory^, and the |other the ^Imagination^. 'Tis evident
at first sight, that the ideas of the memory are much more lively and strong
than those of the imagination, and that the former faculty paints its objects in
more distinct colours, than any which are employ'd by the latter. When we
remember any past event, the idea of it flows in upon the mind in a forcible
manner; whereas in the imagination the perception is faint and languid, and
cannot without difficulty be preserv'd by the mind steddy and uniform for any
considerable time. Here then is a sensible difference betwixt one species of
ideas and another. But of this more fully hereafter[n3].

{#2,pages=9} ^There^ is another difference betwixt these two kinds of ideas,
which is no less evident, namely that tho' neither the ideas of the memory nor
imagination, neither the lively nor faint ideas can make their appearance in the
mind, unless their correspondent impressions have gone before to prepare the way
for them, yet the imagination is not restrain'd to the same order and form with
the original impressions; while the memory is in a manner ty'd down in that
respect, without any power of variation.

{#3,pages=9} '^Tis^ evident, that the memory preserves the original form, in
which its objects were presented, and that where-ever we depart from it in
recollecting any thing, it proceeds from some defect or imperfection in that
faculty. An historian may, perhaps, for the more convenient carrying on of his
narration, relate an event before another, to which it was in fact posterior;
but then he takes notice of this disorder, if he be exact; and by that means
replaces the idea in its due position. 'Tis the same case in our recollection of
those places and persons, with which we were formerly acquainted. The chief
exercise of the memory is not to preserve the simple ideas, but their order and
position. In short, this principle is supported by such a number of common and
vulgar ph{ae}nomena, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of insisting on it
any farther.

{#4,pages=10} ^The^ same evidence follows us in our second principle, _of the
liberty of the imagination to transpose and change its ideas._ The fables we
meet with in poems and romances put this entirely out of question. Nature there
is totally confounded, and nothing mentioned but winged horses, fiery dragons,
and monstrous giants. Nor will this liberty of the fancy appear strange, when we
consider, that all our ideas are copy'd from our impressions, and that there are
not any two impressions which are perfectly inseparable. Not to mention, that
this is an evident consequence of the division of ideas into simple and complex.
Where-ever the imagination perceives a difference among ideas, it can easily
produce a separation.
