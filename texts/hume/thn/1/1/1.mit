{#1,pages=1-2} ALL the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two
distinct kinds, which I shall call ^Impressions^ and ^Ideas^. The difference
betwixt these consists in the degrees of force and liveliness, with which they
strike upon the mind, and make their way into our thought or consciousness.
Those perceptions, which enter with most force and violence, we may name
_impressions_; and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and
emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul. By _ideas_ I mean the
faint images of these in thinking and reasoning; such as, for instance, are all
the perceptions excited by the present discourse, excepting only, those which
arise from the sight and touch, and excepting the immediate pleasure or
uneasiness it may occasion. I believe it will not be very necessary to employ
many words in explaining this distinction. Every |one of himself will readily
perceive the difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common degrees of
these are easily distinguished; tho' it is not impossible but in particular
instances they may very nearly approach to each other. Thus in sleep, in a
fever, in madness, or in any very violent emotions of soul, our ideas may
approach to our impressions: As on the other hand it sometimes happens, that
{~~the->our~~} impressions are so faint and low, that we cannot distinguish them
from our ideas. But notwithstanding this near resemblance in a few instances,
they are in general so very different, that no-one can make a scruple to rank
them under distinct heads, and assign to each a peculiar name to mark the
difference[n2].

{#2,pages=2} ^There^ is another division of our perceptions, which it will be
convenient to observe, and which extends itself both to our impressions and
ideas. This division is into ^Simple^ and ^Complex^. Simple perceptions or
impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation. The
complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts. Tho' a
particular colour, taste, and smell are qualities all united together in this
apple, 'tis easy to perceive they are not the same, but are at least
distinguishable from each other.

{#3,pages=2-3} ^Having^ by these divisions given an order and arrangement to our
objects, we may now apply ourselves to consider with the more accuracy their
qualities and relations. The first circumstance, that strikes my eye, is the
great resemblance betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other particular,
except their degree of force and vivacity. The one seem to be in a manner the
reflexion of the other; so that all the |perceptions of the mind are double, and
appear both as impressions and ideas. When I shut my eyes and think of my
chamber, the ideas I form are exact representations of the impressions I felt;
nor is there any circumstance of the one, which is not to be found in the other.
In running over my other perceptions, I find still the same resemblance and
representation. Ideas and impressions appear always to correspond to each other.
This circumstance seems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for a moment.

{#4,pages=3} ^Upon^ a more accurate survey I find I have been carried away too
far by the first appearance, and that I must make use of the distinction of
perceptions into _simple and complex_, to limit this general decision, _that all
our ideas and impressions are resembling_. I observe, that many of our complex
ideas never had impressions, that corresponded to them, and that many of our
complex impressions never are exactly copied in ideas. I can imagine to myself
such a city as the _New Jerusalem_, whose pavement is gold and walls are rubies,
tho' I never saw any such. I have seen _Paris_; but shall I affirm I can form
such an idea of that city, as will perfectly represent all its streets and
houses in their real and just proportions?

{#5,pages=3-4} ^I perceive^, therefore, that tho' there is in general a great
resemblance betwixt our _complex_ impressions and ideas, yet the rule is not
universally true, that they are exact copies of each other. We may next consider
how the case stands with our _simple_ perceptions. After the most accurate
examination, of which I am capable, I venture to affirm, that the rule here
holds without any exception, and that every simple idea has a simple impression,
which resembles it; and every simple impression a correspondent idea. That idea
of red, which we form in the dark, and that impression, which strikes our eyes
in sun-shine, differ only in degree, not in nature. That the case is the same
with all our simple impressions and ideas, 'tis impossible to prove by a
particular enumeration of them. Every one may satisfy himself |in this point by
running over as many as he pleases. But if any one should deny this universal
resemblance, I know no way of convincing him, but by desiring him to shew a
simple impression, that has not a correspondent idea, or a simple idea, that has
not a correspondent impression. If he does not answer this challenge, as 'tis
certain he cannot, we may from his silence and our own observation establish our
conclusion.

{#6,pages=4} ^Thus^ we find, that all simple ideas and impressions resemble each
other; and as the complex are formed from them, we may affirm in general, that
these two species of perception are exactly correspondent. Having discover'd
this relation, which requires no farther examination, I am curious to find some
other of their qualities. Let us consider how they stand with regard to their
existence, and which of the impressions and ideas are causes and which effects.

{#7,pages=4} ^The^ _full_ examination of this question is the subject of the
present treatise; and therefore we shall here content ourselves with
establishing one general proposition, _That all our simple ideas in their first
appearance are deriv'd from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them,
and which they exactly represent._

{#8,pages=4-5} ^In^ seeking for ph{ae}nomena to prove this proposition, I find
only those of two kinds; but in each kind the ph{ae}nomena are obvious,
numerous, and conclusive. I first make myself certain, by a new review, of what
I have already asserted, that every simple impression is attended with a
correspondent idea, and every simple idea with a correspondent impression. From
this constant conjunction of resembling perceptions I immediately conclude, that
there is a great connexion betwixt our correspondent impressions and ideas, and
that the existence of the one has a considerable influence upon that of the
other. Such a constant conjunction, in such an infinite number of instances, can
never arise from chance; but clearly proves a dependence of the impressions on
the ideas, or of the ideas on the |impressions. That I may know on which side
this dependence lies, I consider the order of their _first appearance_; and find
by constant experience, that the simple impressions always take the precedence
of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in the contrary order. To give a
child an idea of scarlet or orange, of sweet or bitter, I present the objects,
or in other words, convey to him these impressions; but proceed not so absurdly,
as to endeavour to produce the impressions by exciting the ideas. Our ideas upon
their appearance produce not their correspondent impressions, nor do we perceive
any colour, or feel any sensation merely upon thinking of them. On the other
hand we find, that any {~~impressions->impression~~} either of the mind or body
is constantly followed by an idea, which resembles it, and is only different in
the degrees of force and liveliness. The constant conjunction of our resembling
perceptions, is a convincing proof, that the one are the causes of the other;
and this priority of the impressions is an equal proof, that our impressions are
the causes of our ideas, not our ideas of our impressions.

{#9,pages=5} ^To^ confirm this I consider another plain and convincing
ph{ae}nomenon; which is, that where-ever by any accident the faculties, which
give rise to any impressions, are obstructed in their operations, as when one is
born blind or deaf; not only the impressions are lost, but also their
correspondent ideas; so that there never appear in the mind the least traces of
either of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of sensation are
entirely destroy'd, but likewise where they have never been put in action to
produce a particular impression. We cannot form to ourselves a just idea of the
taste of a pine-apple, without having actually tasted it.

{#10,pages=5-6} ^There^ is however one contradictory ph{ae}nomenon, which may
prove, that 'tis not absolutely impossible for ideas to go before their
correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allow'd, that the
several distinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, or those of sounds,
which are con|vey'd by the hearing, are really different from each other, tho'
at the same time resembling. Now if this be true of different colours, it must
be no less so of the different shades of the same colour, that each of them
produces a distinct idea, independent of the rest. For if this shou'd be deny'd,
'tis possible, by the continual gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly
into what is most remote from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to
be different, you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same.
Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to
have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one
particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to
meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one,
be placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest;
'tis plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will
be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the
contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether 'tis possible for him,
from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the
idea of that particular shade, tho' it had never been conveyed to him by his
senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may
serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always derived from the
correspondent impressions; tho' the instance is so particular and singular, that
'tis scarce worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should
alter our general maxim.

{#11,pages=6-7} But besides this exception, it may not be amiss to remark on
this head, that the principle of the priority of impressions to ideas must be
understood with another limitation, _viz._ that as our ideas are images of our
impressions, so we can form secondary ideas, which are images of the primary; as
appears from this very reasoning concerning them. This is not, properly
speaking, an exception to the rule so much as an explanation of it. Ideas
produce the images of themselves |in new ideas; but as the first ideas are
supposed to be derived from impressions, it still remains true, that all our
simple ideas proceed either mediately or immediately, from their correspondent
impressions.

{#12,pages=7} ^This^ then is the first principle I establish in the science of
human nature; nor ought we to despise it because of the simplicity of its
appearance. For 'tis remarkable, that the present question concerning the
precedency of our impressions or ideas, is the same with what has made so much
noise in other terms, when it has been disputed whether there be any _innate
ideas_, or whether all ideas be derived from sensation and reflexion. We may
observe, that in order to prove the ideas of extension and colour not to be
innate, philosophers do nothing but shew, that they are conveyed by our senses.
To prove the ideas of passion and desire not to be innate, they observe that we
have a preceding experience of these emotions in ourselves. Now if we carefully
examine these arguments, we shall find that they prove nothing but that ideas
are preceded by other more lively perceptions, from which they are derived, and
which they represent. I hope this clear stating of the question will remove all
disputes concerning it, and will render this principle of more use in our
reasonings, than it seems hitherto to have been.

{#n2,pages=2} I here make use of these terms, _impression and idea_, in a sense
different from what is usual, and I hope this liberty will be allowed me.
Perhaps I rather restore the word, idea, to its original sense, from which Mr.
_Locke_ had perverted it, in making it stand for all our perceptions. By the
term of impression I would not be understood to express the manner, in which our
lively perceptions are produced in the soul, but merely the perceptions
themselves; for which there is no particular name either in the _English_ or any
other language, that I know of.
