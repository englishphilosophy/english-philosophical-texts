£4 _Of the connexion or association of ideas._ £4

{#1,pages=10-11} AS all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, and
may be united again in what form it pleases, nothing wou'd be more unaccountable
than the operations of that faculty, were it not guided by some universal
principles, which render it, in some measure, uniform with itself in all times
and places. Were ideas entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone wou'd join
them; and 'tis impossible the same simple ideas should fall regularly into
complex ones (as they commonly do) without some bond of union among them, some
associating quality, by which one idea naturally introduces another. This
uniting principle among ideas is not to be consider'd as an inseparable
connexion; for that has been already excluded from the imagination: Nor yet are
we to conclude, that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing is
more free than that faculty: but we are only to regard it as a gentle force,
which commonly prevails, and is the cause why, among other things, languages so
nearly correspond to each other; nature in a manner pointing out to |every one
those simple ideas, which are most proper to be united into a complex one. The
qualities, from which this association arises, and by which the mind is after
this manner convey'd from one idea to another, are three, _viz._ ^Resemblance^,
^Contiguity^ in time or place, and ^Cause^ and ^Effect^.

{#2,pages=11} ^I believe^ it will not be very necessary to prove, that these
qualities produce an association among ideas, and upon the appearance of one
idea naturally introduce another. 'Tis plain, that in the course of our
thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs
easily from one idea to any other that _resembles_ it, and that this quality
alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. 'Tis likewise evident,
that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them
regularly, and take them as they lie _contiguous_ to each other, the imagination
must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts
of space and time in conceiving its objects. As to the connexion, that is made
by the relation of _cause and effect_, we shall have occasion afterwards to
examine it to the bottom, and therefore shall not at present insist upon it.
'Tis sufficient to observe, that there is no relation, which produces a stronger
connexion in the fancy, and makes one idea more readily recall another, than the
relation of cause and effect betwixt their objects.

{#3,pages=11-2} ^That^ we may understand the full extent of these relations, we
must consider, that two objects are connected together in the imagination, not
only when the one is immediately resembling, contiguous to, or the cause of the
other, but also when there is interposed betwixt them a third object, which
bears to both of them any of these relations. This may be carried on to a great
length; tho' at the same time we may observe, that each remove considerably
weakens the relation. Cousins in the fourth degree are connected by _causation_,
if I may be allowed to use that term; but not so closely as brothers, much less
as child and parent. In general we may observe, that all the relations of blood
depend upon cause |and effect, and are esteemed near or remote, according to the
number of connecting causes interpos'd betwixt the persons.

{#4,pages=12} ^Of^ the three relations above-mention'd this of causation is the
most extensive. Two objects may be consider'd as plac'd in this relation, as
well when one is the cause of any of the actions or motions of the other, as
when the former is the cause of the existence of the latter. For as that action
or motion is nothing but the object itself, consider'd in a certain light, and
as the object continues the same in all its different situations, 'tis easy to
imagine how such an influence of objects upon one another may connect them in
the imagination.

{#5,pages=12} ^We^ may carry this farther, and remark, not only that two objects
are connected by the relation of cause and effect, when the one produces a
motion or any action in the other, but also when it has a power of producing it.
And this we may observe to be the source of all the relations of interest and
duty, by which men influence each other in society, and are placed in the ties
of government and subordination. A master is such-a-one as by his situation,
arising either from force or agreement, has a power of directing in certain
particulars the actions of another, whom we call servant. A judge is one, who in
all disputed cases can fix by his opinion the possession or property of any
thing betwixt any members of the society. When a person is possess'd of any
power, there is no more required to convert it into action, but the exertion of
the will; and _that_ in every case is consider'd as possible, and in many as
probable; especially in the case of authority, where the obedience of the
subject is a pleasure and advantage to the superior.

{#6,pages=12-3} ^These^ are therefore the principles of union or cohesion among
our simple ideas, and in the imagination supply the place of that inseparable
connexion, by which they are united in our memory. Here is a kind of
^Attraction^, which in the mental world will be found to have as extra|ordinary
effects as in the natural, and to shew itself in as many and as various forms.
Its effects are every where conspicuous; but as to its causes, they are mostly
unknown, and must be resolv'd into _original_ qualities of human nature, which I
pretend not to explain. Nothing is more requisite for a true philosopher, than
to restrain the intemperate desire of searching into causes, and having
establish'd any doctrine upon a sufficient number of experiments, rest contented
with that, when he sees a farther examination would lead him into obscure and
uncertain speculations. In that case his enquiry wou'd be much better employ'd
in examining the effects than the causes of his principle.

{#7,pages=13} ^Amongst^ the effects of this union or association of ideas, there
are none more remarkable, than those complex ideas, which are the common
subjects of our thoughts and reasoning, and generally arise from some principle
of union among our simple ideas. These complex ideas may be divided into
_Relations_, _Modes_, and _Substances_. We shall briefly examine each of these
in order, and shall subjoin some considerations concerning our _general_ and
_particular_ ideas, before we leave the present subject, which may be consider'd
as the elements of this philosophy.
