{#1,pages=280} BEING so far advanc'd as to observe a difference betwixt the
_object_ of the passions and their _cause_, and to distinguish in the cause the
_quality_, which operates on the passions, from the _subject_, in which it
inheres; we now proceed to examine what determines each of them to be what it
is, and assigns such a particular object, and quality, and subject to these
affections. By this means we shall fully understand the origin of pride and
humility.

{#2,pages=280} '^Tis^ evident in the first place, that these passions are
determin'd to have self for their _object_, not only by a natural but also by an
original property. No one can doubt but this property is _natural_ from the
constancy and steadiness of its operations. 'Tis always self, which is the
object of pride and humility; and whenever the passions look beyond, 'tis still
with a view to ourselves, nor can any person or object otherwise have any
influence upon us.

{#3,pages=280} ^That^ this proceeds from an _original_ quality or primary
impulse, will likewise appear evident, if we consider that 'tis the
distinguishing characteristic of these passions. Unless nature had given some
original qualities to the mind, it cou'd never have any secondary ones; because
in that case it wou'd have no foundation for action, nor cou'd ever begin to
exert itself. Now these qualities, which we must consider as original, are such
as are most inseparable from the soul, and can be resolv'd into no other: And
such is the quality, which determines the object of pride and humility.

{#4,pages=280-1} ^We^ may, perhaps, make it a greater question, whether the
_causes_, that produce the passion, be as _natural_ as the object, to which it
is directed, and whether all that vast variety proceeds from caprice or from the
constitution of the mind. This doubt we shall soon remove, if we cast our eye
upon |human nature, and consider that in all nations and ages, the same objects
still give rise to pride and humility; and that upon the view even of a
stranger, we can know pretty nearly, what will either encrease or diminish his
passions of this kind. If there be any variation in this particular, it proceeds
from nothing but a difference in the tempers and complexions of men; and is
besides very inconsiderable. Can we imagine it possible, that while human nature
remains the same, men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power,
riches, beauty or personal merit, and that their pride and vanity will not be
affected by these advantages?

{#5,pages=281-2} ^But^ tho' the causes of pride and humility be plainly
_natural_, we shall find upon examination, that they are not _original_, and
that 'tis utterly impossible they shou'd each of them be adapted to these
passions by a particular provision, and primary constitution of nature. Beside
their prodigious number, many of them are the effects of art, and arise partly
from the industry, partly from the caprice, and partly from the good fortune of
men. Industry produces houses, furniture, cloaths. Caprice determines their
particular kinds and qualities. And good fortune frequently contributes to all
this, by discovering the effects that result from the different mixtures and
combinations of bodies. 'Tis absurd, therefore, to imagine, that each of these
was foreseen and provided for by nature, and that every new production of art,
which causes pride or humility; instead of adapting itself to the passion by
partaking of some general quality, that naturally operates on the mind; is
itself the object of an original principle, which till then lay conceal'd in the
soul, and is only by accident at last brought to light. Thus the first mechanic,
that invented a fine {~~scritoure->scritoire~~}, produc'd pride in him, who
became possest of it, by principles different from those, which made him proud
of handsome chairs and tables. As this appears evidently ridiculous, we must
conclude, that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions
by a distinct original quality; but that there are some one or more
cir|cumstances common to all of them, on which their efficacy depends.

{#6,pages=282} ^Besides^, we find in the course of nature, that tho' the effects
be many, the principles, from which they arise, are commonly but few and simple,
and that 'tis the sign of an unskilful naturalist to have recourse to a
different quality, in order to explain every different operation. How much more
must this be true with regard to the human mind, which being so confin'd a
subject may justly be thought incapable of containing such a monstrous heap of
principles, as wou'd be necessary to excite the passions of pride and humility,
were each distinct cause adapted to the passion by a distinct set of principles?

{#7,pages=282} ^Here^, therefore, moral philosophy is in the same condition as
natural, with regard to astronomy before the time of _Copernicus_. The antients,
tho' sensible of that maxim, _that nature does nothing in vain_, contriv'd such
intricate systems of the heavens, as seem'd inconsistent with true philosophy,
and gave place at last to something more simple and natural. To invent without
scruple a new principle to every new ph{ae}nomenon, instead of adapting it to
the old; to overload our hypotheses with a variety of this kind; are certain
proofs, that none of these principles is the just one, and that we only desire,
by a number of falshoods, to cover our ignorance of the truth.
