£4 _Of the pride and humility of animals._ £4

{#1,pages=324-5} THUS in whatever light we consider this subject, we may still
observe, that the causes of pride and humility correspond exactly to our
hypothesis, and that nothing can excite either of these passions, unless it be
both related to ourselves, and produces a pleasure or pain independent of the
passion. We |have not only prov'd, that a tendency to produce pleasure or pain
is common to all the causes of pride or humility, but also that 'tis the only
thing, which is common; and consequently is the quality, by which they operate.
We have farther prov'd, that the most considerable causes of these passions are
really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or uneasy sensations;
and therefore that all their effects, and amongst the rest, pride and humility,
are deriv'd solely from that origin. Such simple and natural principles, founded
on such solid proofs, cannot fail to be receiv'd by philosophers, unless oppos'd
by some objections, that have escap'd me.

{#2,pages=325-6} '^Tis^ usual with anatomists to join their observations and
experiments on human bodies to those on beasts, and from the agreement of these
experiments to derive an additional argument for any particular hypothesis. 'Tis
indeed certain, that where the structure of parts in brutes is the same as in
men, and the operation of these parts also the same, the causes of that
operation cannot be different, and that whatever we discover to be true of the
one species, may be concluded without hesitation to be certain of the other.
Thus tho' the mixture of humours and the composition of minute parts may justly
be presum'd to be somewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals; and
therefore any experiment we make upon the one concerning the effects of
medicines will not always apply to the other; yet as the structure of the veins
and muscles, the fabric and situation of the heart, of the lungs, the stomach,
the liver and other parts, are the same or nearly the same in all animals, the
very same hypothesis, which in one species explains muscular motion, the
progress of the chyle, the circulation of the blood, must be applicable to every
one; and according as it agrees or disagrees with the experiments we may make in
any species of creatures, we may draw a proof of its truth or falshood on the
whole. Let us, therefore, apply this method of enquiry, which is found so just
and useful in reasonings |concerning the body, to our present anatomy of the
mind, and see what discoveries we can make by it.

{#3,pages=326} ^In^ order to this we must first shew the correspondence of
_passions_ in men and animals, and afterwards compare the _causes_, which
produce these passions.

{#4,pages=326} '^Tis^ plain, that almost in every species of creatures, but
especially of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and
humility. The very port and gait of a swan, or turkey, or peacock show the high
idea he has entertain'd of himself, and his contempt of all others. This is the
more remarkable, that in the two last species of animals, the pride always
attends the beauty, and is discover'd in the male only. The vanity and emulation
of nightingales in singing have been commonly remark'd; as likewise that of
horses in swiftness, of hounds in sagacity and smell, of the bull and cock in
strength, and of every other animal in his particular excellency. Add to this,
that every species of creatures, which approach so often to man, as to
familiarize themselves with him, show an evident pride in his approbation, and
are pleas'd with his praises and caresses, independent of every other
consideration. Nor are they the caresses of every one without distinction, which
give them this vanity, but those principally of the persons they know and love;
in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind. All these are evident
proofs, that pride and humility are not merely human passions, but extend
themselves over the whole animal creation.

{#5,pages=326-7} ^The^ _causes_ of these passions are likewise much the same in
beasts as in us, making a just allowance for our superior knowledge and
understanding. Thus animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice; they
quickly lose sight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of that of right
and property; For which reason the causes of their pride and humility must lie
solely in the body, and can never be plac'd either in the mind or external
objects. But so far as regards the body, the same qualities cause pride in the
animal as in the human kind; and 'tis on beauty, strength, swiftness or some
|other useful or agreeable quality that this passion is always founded.

{#6,pages=327} ^The^ next question is, whether, since those passions are the
same, and arise from the same causes thro' the whole creation, the _manner_, in
which the causes operate, be also the same. According to all rules of analogy,
this is justly to be expected; and if we find upon trial, that the explication
of these ph{ae}nomena, which we make use of in one species, will not apply to
the rest, we may presume that that explication, however specious, is in reality
without foundation.

{#7,pages=327} ^In^ order to decide this question, let us consider, that there
is evidently the same _relation_ of ideas, and deriv'd from the same causes, in
the minds of animals as in those of men. A dog, that has hid a bone, often
forgets the place; but when brought to it, his thought passes easily to what he
formerly conceal'd, by means of the contiguity, which produces a relation among
his ideas. In like manner, when he has been heartily beat in any place, he will
tremble on his approach to it, even tho' he discover no signs of any present
danger. The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable; but as that relation
makes a considerable ingredient in causation, of which all animals shew so
evident a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of resemblance,
contiguity and causation operate in the same manner upon beasts as upon human
creatures.

{#8,pages=327} ^There^ are also instances of the relation of impressions,
sufficient to convince us, that there is an union of certain affections with
each other in the inferior species of creatures as well as in the superior, and
that their minds are frequently convey'd thro' a series of connected emotions. A
dog, when elevated with joy, runs naturally into love and kindness, whether of
his master or of the sex. In like manner, when full of pain and sorrow, he
becomes quarrelsome and ill-natur'd; and that passion, which at first was grief,
is by the smallest occasion converted into anger.

{#9,pages=327-8} ^Thus^ all the internal principles, that are necessary in us
|to produce either pride or humility, are common to all creatures; and since the
causes, which excite these passions, are likewise the same, we may justly
conclude, that these causes operate after the same _manner_ thro' the whole
animal creation. My hypothesis is so simple, and supposes so little reflection
and judgment, that 'tis applicable to every sensible creature; which must not
only be allow'd to be a convincing proof of its veracity, but, I am confident,
will be found an objection to every other system.
