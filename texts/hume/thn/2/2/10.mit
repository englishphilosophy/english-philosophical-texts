{#1,pages=389} THERE now remains only to explain the passions of _respect_ and
_contempt_, along with the _amorous_ affection, in order to understand all the
passions which have any mixture of love or hatred. Let us begin with respect and
contempt.

{#2,pages=389-90} ^In^ considering the qualities and circumstances of others, we
may either regard them as they really are in themselves; |or may make a
comparison betwixt them and our own qualities and circumstances; or may join
these two methods of consideration. The good qualities of others, from the first
point of view, produce love; from the second, humility; and from the third,
respect; which is a mixture of these two passions. Their bad qualities, after
the same manner, cause either hatred, or pride, or contempt, according to the
light in which we survey them.

{#3,pages=390} ^That^ there is a mixture of pride in contempt, and of humility
in respect, is, I think, too evident, from their very feeling or appearance, to
require any particular proof. That this mixture arises from a tacit comparison
of the person contemn'd or respected with ourselves is no less evident. The same
man may cause either respect, love, or contempt by his condition and talents,
according as the person, who considers him, from his inferior becomes his equal
or superior. In changing the point of view, tho' the object may remain the same,
its proportion to ourselves entirely alters; which is the cause of an alteration
in the passions. These passions, therefore, arise from our observing the
proportion; that is, from a comparison.

{#4,pages=390} ^I have^ already observ'd, that the mind has a much stronger
propensity to pride than to humility, and have endeavour'd, from the principles
of human nature, to assign a cause for this ph{ae}nomenon. Whether my reasoning
be receiv'd or not, the ph{ae}nomenon is undisputed, and appears in many
instances. Among the rest, 'tis the reason why there is a much greater mixture
of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect, and why we are more elevated
with the view of one below us, than mortify'd with the presence of one above us.
Contempt or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride, that there scarce is any
other passion discernable: Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more
considerable ingredient than humility. The passion of vanity is so prompt, that
it rouzes at the least call; while humility requires a stronger impulse to make
it exert itself.

{#5,pages=391} ^But^ here it may reasonably be ask'd, why this mixture takes
place only in some cases, and appears not on every occasion. All those objects,
which cause love, when plac'd on another person, are the causes of pride, when
transfer'd to ourselves; and consequently ought to be causes of humility, as
well as love, while they belong to others, and are only compar'd to those, which
we ourselves possess. In like manner every quality, which by being directly
consider'd, produces hatred, ought always to give rise to pride by comparison,
and by a mixture of these passions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt
or scorn. The difficulty then is, why any objects ever cause pure love or
hatred, and produce not always the mixt passions of respect and contempt.

{#6,pages=391} ^I have^ suppos'd all along, that the passions of love and pride,
and those of humility and hatred are similar in their sensations, and that the
two former are always agreeable, and the two latter painful. But tho' this be
universally true, 'tis observable, that the two agreeable, as well as the two
painful passions, have some differences, and even contrarieties, which
distinguish them. Nothing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and
vanity; tho' at the same time love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and
infeeble it. The same difference is observable betwixt the uneasy passions.
Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions; while
humility and shame deject and discourage us. Of these qualities of the passions,
'twill be necessary to form a distinct idea. Let us remember, that pride and
hatred invigorate the soul; and love and humility infeeble it.

{#7,pages=391-2} ^From^ this it follows, that tho' the conformity betwixt love
and {~~hatred->pride~~} in the agreeableness of their sensation makes them
always be excited by the same objects, yet this other contrariety is the reason,
why they are excited in very different degrees. Genius and learning are
_pleasant_ and _magnificent_ objects, and by both these circumstances are
adapted to |pride and vanity; but have a relation to love by their pleasure
only. Ignorance and simplicity are _disagreeable_ and _mean_, which in the same
manner gives them a double connexion with humility, and a single one with
hatred. We may, therefore, consider it as certain, that tho' the same object
always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, according to its different
situations, yet it seldom produces either the two former or the two latter
passions in the same proportion.

{#8,pages=392} '^Tis^ here we must seek for a solution of the difficulty
above-mention'd, why any object ever excites pure love or hatred, and does not
always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride. No
quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison, unless it wou'd have
produc'd pride by being plac'd in ourselves; and _vice versa_ no object excites
pride by comparison, unless it wou'd have produc'd humility by the direct
survey. This is evident, objects always produce by _comparison_ a sensation
directly contrary to their _original_ one. Suppose, therefore, an object to be
presented, which is peculiarly fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite
pride; this object, belonging to another, gives rise directly to a great degree
of love, but to a small one of humility by comparison; and consequently that
latter passion is scarce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love
into respect. This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility,
generosity, beauty, and many other qualities. These have a peculiar aptitude to
produce love in others; but not so great a tendency to excite pride in
ourselves: For which reason the view of them, as belonging to another person,
produces pure love, with but a small mixture of humility and respect. 'Tis easy
to extend the same reasoning to the opposite passions.

{#9,pages=392-3} ^Before^ we leave this subject, it may not be amiss to account
for a pretty curious ph{ae}nomenon, _viz._ why we commonly keep at a distance
such as we contemn, and allow not our inferiors to approach too near even in
place |and situation. It has already been observ'd, that almost every kind of
idea is attended with some emotion, even the ideas of number and extension, much
more those of such objects as are esteem'd of consequence in life, and fix our
attention. 'Tis not with entire indifference we can survey either a rich man or
a poor one, but must feel some faint touches, at least, of respect in the former
case, and of contempt in the latter. These two passions are contrary to each
other; but in order to make this contrariety be felt, the objects must be
someway related; otherwise the affections are totally separate and distinct, and
never encounter. The relation takes place wherever the persons become
contiguous; which is a general reason why we are uneasy at seeing such
disproportion'd objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a nobleman and a porter,
in that situation.

{#10,pages=393} ^This^ uneasiness, which is common to every spectator, must be
more sensible to the superior; and that because the near approach of the
inferior is regarded as a piece of ill-breeding, and shews that he is not
sensible of the disproportion, and is no way affected by it. A sense of
superiority in another breeds in all men an inclination to keep themselves at a
distance from him, and determines them to redouble the marks of respect and
reverence, when they are oblig'd to approach him; and where they do not observe
that conduct, 'tis a proof they are not sensible of his superiority. From hence
too it proceeds, that any great _difference_ in the degrees of any quality is
call'd a _distance_ by a common metaphor, which, however trivial it may appear,
is founded on natural principles of the imagination. A great difference inclines
us to produce a distance. The ideas of distance and difference are, therefore,
connected together. Connected ideas are readily taken for each other; and this
is in general the source of the metaphor, as we shall have occasion to observe
afterwards.
