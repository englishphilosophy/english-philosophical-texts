£4 _Of malice and envy._ £4

{#1,pages=372} WE must now proceed to account for the passion of _malice_, which
imitates the effects of hatred, as pity does those of love; and gives us a joy
in the sufferings and miseries of others, without any offence or injury on their
part.

{#2,pages=372} ^So^ little are men govern'd by reason in their sentiments and
opinions, that they always judge more of objects by comparison than from their
intrinsic worth and value. When the mind considers, or is accustom'd to, any
degree of perfection, whatever falls short of it, tho' really esteemable, has
notwithstanding the same effect upon the passions, as what is defective and ill.
This is an _original_ quality of the soul, and similar to what we have every day
experience of in our bodies. Let a man heat one hand and cool the other; the
same water will, at the same time, seem both hot and cold, according to the
disposition of the different organs. A small degree of any quality, succeeding a
greater, produces the same sensation, as if less than it really is, and even
sometimes as the opposite quality. Any gentle pain, that follows a violent one,
seems as nothing, or rather becomes a pleasure; as on the other hand a violent
pain, succeeding a gentle one, is doubly grievous and uneasy.

{#3,pages=372-3} ^This^ no one can doubt of with regard to our passions and
sensations. But there may arise some difficulty with regard to our ideas and
objects. When an object augments or diminishes to the eye or imagination from a
comparison with others, the image and idea of the object are still the same, and
are equally extended in the _retina_, and in the brain or organ of perception.
The eyes refract the rays of light, and the optic nerves convey the images to
the brain in the very same manner, whether a great or small object has preceded;
nor does even the imagination alter the dimensions of its object on account of a
comparison with others. The ques|tion then is, how from the same impression and
the same idea we can form such different judgments concerning the same object,
and at one time admire its bulk, and at another despise its littleness. This
variation in our judgments must certainly proceed from a variation in some
perception; but as the variation lies not in the immediate impression or idea of
the object, it must lie in some other impression, that accompanies it.

{#4,pages=373-4} ^In^ order to explain this matter, I shall just touch upon two
principles, one of which shall be more fully explain'd in the progress of this
treatise; the other has been already accounted for. I believe it may safely be
establish'd for a general maxim, that no object is presented to the senses, nor
image form'd in the fancy, but what is accompany'd with some emotion or movement
of spirits proportion'd to it; and however custom may make us insensible of this
sensation, and cause us to confound it with the object or idea, 'twill be easy,
by careful and exact experiments, to separate and distinguish them. For to
instance only in the cases of extension and number; 'tis evident, that any very
bulky object, such as the ocean, an extended plain, a vast chain of mountains, a
wide forest; or any very numerous collection of objects, such as an army, a
fleet, a crowd, excite in the mind a sensible emotion; and that the admiration,
which arises on the appearance of such objects, is one of the most lively
pleasures, which human nature is capable of enjoying. Now as this admiration
encreases or diminishes by the encrease or diminution of the objects, we may
conclude, according to our foregoing[n65] principles, that 'tis a compound
effect, proceeding from the conjunction of the several effects, which arise from
each part of the cause. Every part, then, of extension, and every unite of
number has a separate emotion attending it, when conceiv'd by the mind; and tho'
that emotion be not always agreeable, yet by its conjunction with others, and by
its agitating the spirits to a just pitch, |it contributes to the production of
admiration, which is always agreeable. If this be allow'd with respect to
extension and number, we can make no difficulty with respect to virtue and vice,
wit and folly, riches and poverty, happiness and misery, and other objects of
that kind, which are always attended with an evident emotion.

{#5,pages=374} ^The^ second principle I shall take notice of is that of our
adherence to _general rules_; which has such a mighty influence on the actions
and understanding, and is able to impose on the very senses. When an object is
found by experience to be always accompany'd with another; whenever the first
object appears, tho' chang'd in very material circumstances; we naturally fly to
the conception of the second, and form an idea of it in as lively and strong a
manner, as if we had infer'd its existence by the justest and most authentic
conclusion of our understanding. Nothing can undeceive us, not even our senses,
which, instead of correcting this false judgment, are often perverted by it, and
seem to authorize its errors.

{#6,pages=374-5} ^The^ conclusion I draw from these two principles, join'd to
the influence of comparison above-mention'd, is very short and decisive. Every
object is attended with some emotion proportion'd to it; a great object with a
great emotion, a small object with a small emotion. A great _object_, therefore,
succeeding a small one makes a great _emotion_ succeed a small one. Now a great
emotion succeeding a small one becomes still greater, and rises beyond its
ordinary proportion. But as there is a certain degree of an emotion, which
commonly attends every magnitude of an object; when the emotion encreases, we
naturally imagine that the object has likewise encreas'd. The effect conveys our
view to its usual cause, a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of
the object; nor do we consider, that comparison may change the emotion without
changing any thing in the object. Those, who are acquainted with the
metaphysical part of optics, and know how we transfer the judg|ments and
conclusions of the understanding to the senses, will easily conceive this whole
operation.

{#7,pages=375} ^But^ leaving this new discovery of an impression, that secretly
attends every idea; we must at least allow of that principle, from whence the
discovery arose, _that objects appear greater or less by a comparison with
others_. We have so many instances of this, that it is impossible we can dispute
its veracity; and 'tis from this principle I derive the passions of malice and
envy.

{#8,pages=375} '^Tis^ evident we must receive a greater or less satisfaction or
uneasiness from reflecting on our own condition and circumstances, in proportion
as they appear more or less fortunate or unhappy, in proportion to the degrees
of riches, and power, and merit, and reputation, which we think ourselves
possest of. Now as we seldom judge of objects from their intrinsic value, but
form our notions of them from a comparison with other objects; it follows, that
according as we observe a greater or less share of happiness or misery in
others, we must make an estimate of our own, and feel a consequent pain or
pleasure. The misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our happiness,
and his happiness of our misery. The former, therefore, produces delight; and
the latter uneasiness.

{#9,pages=375-6} ^Here^ then is a kind of pity reverst, or contrary sensations
arising in the beholder, from those which are felt by the person, whom he
considers. In general we may observe, that in all kinds of comparison an object
makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a sensation
contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. A small
object makes a great one appear still greater. A great object makes a little one
appear less. Deformity of itself produces uneasiness; but makes us receive new
pleasure by its contrast with a beautiful object, whose beauty is augmented by
it; as on the other hand, beauty, which of itself produces pleasure, makes us
receive a new pain by the contrast with any thing ugly, whose de|formity it
augments. The case, therefore, must be the same with happiness and misery. The
direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure, and therefore
produces pain when compar'd with our own. His pain, consider'd in itself, is
painful to us, but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us
pleasure.

{#10,pages=376} ^Nor^ will it appear strange, that we may feel a reverst
sensation from the happiness and misery of others; since we find the same
comparison may give us a kind of malice against ourselves, and make us rejoice
for our pains, and grieve for our pleasures. Thus the prospect of past pain is
agreeable, when we are satisfy'd with our present condition; as on the other
hand our past pleasures give us uneasiness, when we enjoy nothing at present
equal to them. The comparison being the same, as when we reflect on the
sentiments of others, must be attended with the same effects.

{#11,pages=376-7} ^Nay^ a person may extend this malice against himself, even to
his present fortune, and carry it so far as designedly to seek affliction, and
encrease his pains and sorrows. This may happen upon two occasions. _First_,
Upon the distress and misfortune of a friend, or person dear to him. _Secondly_,
Upon the feeling any remorses for a crime, of which he has been guilty. 'Tis
from the principle of comparison that both these irregular appetites for evil
arise. A person, who indulges himself in any pleasure, while his friend lies
under affliction, feels the reflected uneasiness from his friend more sensibly
by a comparison with the original pleasure, which he himself enjoys. This
contrast, indeed, ought also to inliven the present pleasure. But as grief is
here suppos'd to be the predominant passion, every addition falls to that side,
and is swallow'd up in it, without operating in the least upon the contrary
affection. 'Tis the same case with those penances, which men inflict on
themselves for their past sins and failings. When a criminal reflects on the
punishment he deserves, the idea of it is magnify'd by a comparison with his
present ease and satisfaction; which forces him, in a |manner, to seek
uneasiness, in order to avoid so disagreeable a contrast.

{#12,pages=377} ^This^ reasoning will account for the origin of _envy_ as well
as of malice. The only difference betwixt these passions lies in this, that envy
is excited by some present enjoyment of another, which by comparison diminishes
our idea of our own: Whereas malice is the unprovok'd desire of producing evil
to another, in order to reap a pleasure from the comparison. The enjoyment,
which is the object of envy, is commonly superior to our own. A superiority
naturally seems to overshade us, and presents a disagreeable comparison. But
even in the case of an inferiority, we still desire a greater distance, in order
to augment still more the idea of ourself. When this distance diminishes, the
comparison is less to our advantage; and consequently gives us less pleasure,
and is even disagreeable. Hence arises that species of envy, which men feel,
when they perceive their inferiors approaching or overtaking them in the pursuit
of glory or happiness. In this envy we may see the effects of comparison twice
repeated. A man, who compares himself to his inferior, receives a pleasure from
the comparison: And when the inferiority decreases by the elevation of the
inferior, what shou'd only have been a decrease of pleasure, becomes a real
pain, by a new comparison with its preceding condition.

{#13,pages=377-8} '^Tis^ worthy of observation concerning that envy, which
arises from a superiority in others, that 'tis not the great disproportion
betwixt ourself and another, which produces it; but on the contrary, our
proximity. A common soldier bears no such envy to his general as to his sergeant
or corporal; nor does an eminent writer meet with so great jealousy in common
hackney scriblers, as in authors, that more nearly approach him. It may, indeed,
be thought, that the greater the disproportion is, the greater must be the
uneasiness from the comparison. But we may consider on the other hand, that the
great disproportion cuts off the rela|tion, and either keeps us from comparing
ourselves with what is remote from us, or diminishes the effects of the
comparison. Resemblance and proximity always produce a relation of ideas; and
where you destroy these ties, however other accidents may bring two ideas
together; as they have no bond or connecting quality to join them in the
imagination; 'tis impossible they can remain long united, or have any
considerable influence on each other.

{#14,pages=378} ^I have^ observ'd in considering the nature of ambition, that
the great feel a double pleasure in authority from the comparison of their own
condition with that of their slaves; and that this comparison has a double
influence, because 'tis natural, and presented by the subject. When the fancy,
in the comparison of objects, passes not easily from the one object to the
other, the action of the mind is, in a great measure, broke, and the fancy, in
considering the second object, begins, as it were, upon a new footing. The
impression, which attends every object, seems not greater in that case by
succeeding a less of the same kind; but these two impressions are distinct, and
produce their distinct effects, without any communication together. The want of
relation in the ideas breaks the relation of the impressions, and by such a
separation prevents their mutual operation and influence.

{#15,pages=378} ^To^ confirm this we may observe, that the proximity in the
degree of merit is not alone sufficient to give rise to envy, but must be
assisted by other relations. A poet is not apt to envy a philosopher, or a poet
of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a different age. All these
differences prevent or weaken the comparison, and consequently the passion.

{#16,pages=378} ^This^ too is the reason, why all objects appear great or
little, merely by a comparison with those of the same species. A mountain
neither magnifies nor diminishes a horse in our eyes; but when a _Flemish_ and a
_Welsh_ horse are seen together, the one appears greater and the other less,
than when view'd apart.

{#17,pages=379} ^From^ the same principle we may account for that remark of
historians, that any party in a civil war always choose to call in a foreign
enemy at any hazard rather than submit to their fellow-citizens. _Guicciardin_
applies this remark to the wars in _Italy_, where the relations betwixt the
different states are, properly speaking, nothing but of name, language, and
contiguity. Yet even these relations, when join'd with superiority, by making
the comparison more natural, make it likewise more grievous, and cause men to
search for some other superiority, which may be attended with no relation, and
by that means may have a less sensible influence on the imagination. The mind
quickly perceives its several advantages and disadvantages; and finding its
situation to be most uneasy, where superiority is conjoin'd with other
relations, seeks its repose as much as possible, by their separation, and by
breaking that association of ideas, which renders the comparison so much more
natural and efficacious. When it cannot break the association, it feels a
stronger desire to remove the superiority; and this is the reason why travellers
are commonly so lavish of their praises to the _Chinese_ and _Persians_, at the
same time, that they depreciate those neighbouring nations, which may stand upon
a foot of rivalship with their native country.

{#18,pages=379-80} ^These^ examples from history and common experience are rich
and curious; but we may find parallel ones in the arts, which are no less
remarkable. Shou'd an author compose a treatise, of which one part was serious
and profound, another light and humorous, every one wou'd condemn so strange a
mixture, and wou'd accuse him of the neglect of all rules of art and criticism.
These rules of art are founded on the qualities of human nature; and the quality
of human nature, which requires a consistency in every performance, is that
which renders the mind incapable of passing in a moment from one passion and
disposition to a quite different one. Yet this makes us not blame Mr. _Prior_
for joining his _Alma_ and his _Solomon_ in the same volume; tho' |that
admirable poet has succeeded perfectly well in the gaiety of the one, as well as
in the melancholy of the other. Even supposing the reader shou'd peruse these
two compositions without any interval, he wou'd feel little or no difficulty in
the change of passions: Why, but because he considers these performances as
entirely different, and by this break in the ideas, breaks the progress of the
affections, and hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the other?

{#19,pages=380} ^An^ heroic and burlesque design, united in one picture, wou'd
be monstrous; tho' we place two pictures of so opposite a character in the same
chamber, and even close by each other, without any scruple or difficulty.

{#20,pages=380} ^In^ a word, no ideas can affect each other, either by
comparison, or by the passions they separately produce, unless they be united
together by some relation, which may cause an easy transition of the ideas, and
consequently of the emotions or impressions, attending the ideas; and may
preserve the one impression in the passage of the imagination to the object of
the other. This principle is very remarkable, because it is analogous to what we
have observ'd both concerning the _understanding_ and the _passions_. Suppose
two objects to be presented to me, which are not connected by any kind of
relation. Suppose that each of these objects separately produces a passion; and
that these two passions are in themselves contrary: We find from experience,
that the want of relation in the objects or ideas hinders the natural
contrariety of the passions, and that the break in the transition of the thought
removes the affections from each other, and prevents their opposition. 'Tis the
same case with comparison; and from both these ph{ae}nomena we may safely
conclude, that the relation of ideas must forward the transition of impressions;
since its absence alone is able to prevent it, and to separate what naturally
shou'd have operated upon each other. When the absence of an object or quality
removes any usual or natural effect, we may certainly conclude that its presence
contributes to the production of the effect.
