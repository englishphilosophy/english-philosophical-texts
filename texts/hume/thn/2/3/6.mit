£4 _Of the influence of the imagination on the passions._ £4

{#1,pages=424} 'TIS remarkable, that the imagination and affections have a close
union together, and that nothing, which affects the former, can be entirely
indifferent to the latter. Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a new
vivacity, the passions become more violent; and keep pace with the imagination
in all its variations. Whether this proceeds from the principle above-mention'd,
_that any attendant emotion is easily converted into the predominant_, I shall
not determine. 'Tis sufficient for my present purpose, that we have many
instances to confirm this influence of the imagination upon the passions.

{#2,pages=424-5} ^Any^ pleasure, with which we are acquainted, affects us more
than any other, which we own to be superior, but of whose nature we are wholly
ignorant. Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea: The other we
conceive under the general notion of pleasure; and 'tis certain, |that the more
general and universal any of our ideas are, the less influence they have upon
the imagination. A general idea, tho' it be nothing but a particular one
consider'd in a certain view, is commonly more obscure; and that because no
particular idea, by which we represent a general one, is ever fix'd or
determinate, but may easily be chang'd for other particular ones, which will
serve equally in the representation.

{#3,pages=425} ^There^ is a noted passage in the history of _Greece_, which may
serve for our present purpose. _Themistocles_ told the _Athenians_, that he had
form'd a design, which wou'd be highly useful to the public, but which 'twas
impossible for him to communicate to them without ruining the execution, since
its success depended entirely on the secrecy with which it shou'd be conducted.
The _Athenians_, instead of granting him full power to act as he thought
fitting, order'd him to communicate his design to _Aristides_, in whose prudence
they had an entire confidence, and whose opinion they were resolv'd blindly to
submit to. The design of _Themistocles_ was secretly to set fire to the fleet of
all the _Grecian_ commonwealths, which was assembled in a neighbouring port, and
which being once destroy'd, wou'd give the _Athenians_ the empire of the sea
without any rival. _Aristides_ return'd to the assembly, and told them, that
nothing cou'd be more advantageous than the design of _Themistocles_; but at the
same time that nothing cou'd be more unjust: Upon which the people unanimously
rejected the project.

{#4,pages=425-6} ^A late^ celebrated[n66] historian admires this passage of
antient history, as one of the most singular that is any where to be met with.
_Here_, says he, _they are not philosophers, to whom 'tis easy in their schools
to establish the finest maxims and most sublime rules of morality, who decide
that interest ought never to prevail above justice. 'Tis a whole people
interested in the proposal, which is made to them, who consider it as of
importance to the public good, and who notwithstanding reject it |unanimously,
and without hesitation, merely because it is contrary to justice_. For my part I
see nothing so extraordinary in this proceeding of the _Athenians_. The same
reasons, which render it so easy for philosophers to establish these sublime
maxims, tend, in part, to diminish the merit of such a conduct in that people.
Philosophers never ballance betwixt profit and honesty, because their decisions
are general, and neither their passions nor imaginations are interested in the
objects. And tho' in the present case the advantage was immediate to the
_Athenians_, yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage,
without being conceiv'd by any particular idea, it must have had a less
considerable influence on their imaginations, and have been a less violent
temptation, than if they had been acquainted with all its circumstances:
Otherwise 'tis difficult to conceive, that a whole people, unjust and violent as
men commonly are, shou'd so unanimously have adher'd to justice, and rejected
any considerable advantage.

{#5,pages=426} ^Any^ satisfaction, which we lately enjoy'd, and of which the
memory is fresh and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than
another of which the traces are decay'd, and almost obliterated. From whence
does this proceed, but that the memory in the first case assists the fancy, and
gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions? The image of the past
pleasure being strong and violent, bestows these qualities on the idea of the
future pleasure, which is connected with it by the relation of resemblance.

{#6,pages=426} ^A pleasure^, which is suitable to the way of life, in which we
are engag'd, excites more our desires and appetites than another, which is
foreign to it. This ph{ae}nomenon may be explain'd from the same principle.

{#7,pages=426-7} ^Nothing^ is more capable of infusing any passion into the
mind, than eloquence, by which objects are represented in their strongest and
most lively colours. We may of ourselves acknowledge, that such an object is
valuable, and such another odious; but 'till an orator excites the imagination,
|and gives force to these ideas, they may have but a feeble influence either on
the will or the affections.

{#8,pages=427} ^But^ eloquence is not always necessary. The bare opinion of
another, especially when inforc'd with passion, will cause an idea of good or
evil to have an influence upon us, which wou'd otherwise have been entirely
neglected. This proceeds from the principle of sympathy or communication; and
sympathy, as I have already observ'd, is nothing but the conversion of an idea
into an impression by the force of imagination.

{#9,pages=427} '^Tis^ remarkable, that lively passions commonly attend a lively
imagination. In this respect, as well as others, the force of the passion
depends as much on the temper of the person, as the nature or situation of the
object.

{#10,pages=427} ^I have^ already observ'd, that belief is nothing but a lively
idea related to a present impression. This vivacity is a requisite circumstance
to the exciting all our passions, the calm as well as the violent; nor has a
mere fiction of the imagination any considerable influence upon either of them.
'Tis too weak to take any hold of the mind, or be attended with emotion.
