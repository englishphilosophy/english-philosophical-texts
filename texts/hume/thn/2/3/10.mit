{#1,pages=448} BUT methinks we have been not a little inattentive to run over so
many different parts of the human mind, and examine so many passions, without
taking once into the consideration that love of truth, which was the first
source of all our enquiries. 'Twill therefore be proper, before we leave this
subject, to bestow a few reflections on that passion, and shew its origin in
human nature. 'Tis an affection of so peculiar a kind, that 'twoud have been
impossible to have treated of it under any of those heads, which we have
examin'd, without danger of obscurity and confusion.

{#2,pages=448-9} ^Truth^ is of two kinds, consisting either in the discovery of
the proportions of ideas, consider'd as such, or in the conformity of our ideas
of objects to their real existence. 'Tis certain, that the former species of
truth, is not desir'd merely |as truth, and that 'tis not the justness of our
conclusions, which alone gives the pleasure. For these conclusions are equally
just, when we discover the equality of two bodies by a pair of compasses, as
when we learn it by a mathematical demonstration; and tho' in the one case the
proofs be demonstrative, and in the other only sensible, yet generally speaking,
the mind acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other. And in an
arithmetical operation, where both the truth and the assurance are of the same
nature, as in the most profound algebraical problem, the pleasure is very
inconsiderable, if rather it does not degenerate into pain: Which is an evident
proof, that the satisfaction, which we sometimes receive from the discovery of
truth, proceeds not from it, merely as such, but only as endow'd with certain
qualities.

{#3,pages=449} ^The^ first and most considerable circumstance requisite to
render truth agreeable, is the genius and capacity, which is employ'd in its
invention and discovery. What is easy and obvious is never valu'd; and even what
is _in itself_ difficult, if we come to the knowledge of it without difficulty,
and without any stretch of thought or judgment, is but little regarded. We love
to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians; but shou'd receive small
entertainment from a person, who shou'd barely inform us of the proportions of
lines and angles, tho' we repos'd the utmost confidence both in his judgment and
veracity. In this case 'tis sufficient to have ears to learn the truth. We never
are oblig'd to fix our attention or exert our genius; which of all other
exercises of the mind is the most pleasant and agreeable.

{#4,pages=449-50} ^But^ tho' the exercise of genius be the principal source of
that satisfaction we receive from the sciences, yet I doubt, if it be alone
sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment. The truth we discover must
also be of some importance. 'Tis easy to multiply algebraical problems to
infinity, nor is there any end in the discovery of the proportions of conic
sections; tho' few mathematicians take any pleasure in these |researches, but
turn their thoughts to what is more useful and important. Now the question is,
after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us? The difficulty on
this head arises from hence, that many philosophers have consum'd their time,
have destroy'd their health, and neglected their fortune, in the search of such
truths, as they esteem'd important and useful to the world, tho' it appear'd
from their whole conduct and behaviour, that they were not endow'd with any
share of public spirit, nor had any concern for the interests of mankind. Were
they convinc'd, that their discoveries were of no consequence, they wou'd
entirely lose all relish for their studies, and that tho' the consequences be
entirely indifferent to them; which seems to be a contradiction.

{#5,pages=450} ^To^ remove this contradiction, we must consider, that there are
certain desires and inclinations, which go no farther than the imagination, and
are rather the faint shadows and images of passions, than any real affections.
Thus, suppose a man, who takes a survey of the fortifications of any city;
considers their strength and advantages, natural or acquir'd; observes the
disposition and contrivance of the bastions, ramparts, mines, and other military
works; 'tis plain, that in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their
ends, he will receive a suitable pleasure and satisfaction. This pleasure, as it
arises from the utility, not the form of the objects, can be no other than a
sympathy with the inhabitants, for whose security all this art is employ'd; tho'
'tis possible, that this person, as a stranger or an enemy, may in his heart
have no kindness for them, or may even entertain a hatred against them.

{#6,pages=450-1} ^It^ may indeed be objected, that such a remote sympathy is a
very slight foundation for a passion, and that so much industry and application,
as we frequently observe in philosophers, can never be deriv'd from so
inconsiderable an original. But here I return to what I have already remark'd,
that the pleasure of study consists chiefly in the action of the |mind, and the
exercise of the genius and understanding in the discovery or comprehension of
any truth. If the importance of the truth be requisite to compleat the pleasure,
'tis not on account of any considerable addition, which of itself it brings to
our enjoyment, but only because 'tis, in some measure, requisite to fix our
attention. When we are careless and inattentive, the same action of the
understanding has no effect upon us, nor is able to convey any of that
satisfaction, which arises from it, when we are in another disposition.

{#7,pages=451} ^But^ beside the action of the mind, which is the principal
foundation of the pleasure, there is likewise requir'd a degree of success in
the attainment of the end, or the discovery of that truth we examine. Upon this
head I shall make a general remark, which may be useful on many occasions,
_viz._ that where the mind pursues any end with passion; tho' that passion be
not deriv'd originally from the end, but merely from the action and pursuit; yet
by the natural course of the affections, we acquire a concern for the end
itself, and are uneasy under any disappointment we meet with in the pursuit of
it. This proceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the passions
above-mention'd.

{#8,pages=451-2} ^To^ illustrate all this by a similar instance, I shall
observe, that there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other,
than those of hunting and philosophy, whatever disproportion may at first sight
appear betwixt them. 'Tis evident, that the pleasure of hunting consists in the
action of the mind and body; the motion, the attention, the difficulty, and the
uncertainty. 'Tis evident likewise, that these actions must be attended with an
idea of utility, in order to their having any effect upon us. A man of the
greatest fortune, and the farthest remov'd from avarice, tho' he takes a
pleasure in hunting after patridges and pheasants, feels no satisfaction in
shooting crows and magpies; and that because he considers the first as fit for
the table, and the other as entirely useless. Here 'tis certain, that the
utility or importance of |itself causes no real passion, but is only requisite
to support the imagination; and the same person, who over-looks a ten times
greater profit in any other subject, is pleas'd to bring home half a dozen
woodcocks or plovers, after having employ'd several hours in hunting after them.
To make the parallel betwixt hunting and philosophy more compleat, we may
observe, that tho' in both cases the end of our action may in itself be
despis'd, yet in the heat of the action we acquire such an attention to this
end, that we are very uneasy under any disappointments, and are sorry when we
either miss our game, or fall into any error in our reasoning.

{#9,pages=452} ^If^ we want another parallel to these affections, we may
consider the passion of gaming, which affords a pleasure from the same
principles as hunting and philosophy. It has been remark'd, that the pleasure of
gaming arises not from interest alone; since many leave a sure gain for this
entertainment: Neither is it deriv'd from the game alone; since the same persons
have no satisfaction, when they play for nothing: But proceeds from both these
causes united, tho' separately they have no effect. 'Tis here, as in certain
chymical preparations, where the mixture of two clear and transparent liquids
produces a third, which is opaque and colour'd.

{#10,pages=452} ^The^ interest, which we have in any game, engages our
attention, without which we can have no enjoyment, either in that or in any
other action. Our attention being once engag'd, the difficulty, variety, and
sudden reverses of fortune, still farther interest us; and 'tis from that
concern our satisfaction arises. Human life is so tiresome a scene, and men
generally are of such indolent dispositions, that whatever amuses them, tho' by
a passion mixt with pain, does in the main give them a sensible pleasure. And
this pleasure is here encreas'd by the nature of the objects, which being
sensible, and of a narrow compass, are enter'd into with facility, and are
agreeable to the imagination.

{#11,pages=452-3} ^The^ same theory, that accounts for the love of truth in
|mathematics and algebra, may be extended to morals, politics, natural
philosophy, and other studies, where we consider not the abstract relations of
ideas, but their real connexions and existence. But beside the love of
knowledge, which displays itself in the sciences, there is a certain curiosity
implanted in human nature, which is a passion deriv'd from a quite different
principle. Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and
circumstances of their neighbours, tho' their interest be no way concern'd in
them, and they must entirely depend on others for their information; in which
case there is no room for study or application. Let us search for the reason of
this ph{ae}nomenon.

{#12,pages=453-4} ^It^ has been prov'd at large, that the influence of belief is
at once to inliven and infix any idea in the imagination, and prevent all kind
of hesitation and uncertainty about it. Both these circumstances are
advantageous. By the vivacity of the idea we interest the fancy, and produce,
tho' in a lesser degree, the same pleasure, which arises from a moderate
passion. As the vivacity of the idea gives pleasure, so its certainty prevents
uneasiness, by fixing one particular idea in the mind, and keeping it from
wavering in the choice of its objects. 'Tis a quality of human nature, which is
conspicuous on many occasions, and is common both to the mind and body, that too
sudden and violent a change is unpleasant to us, and that however any objects
may in themselves be indifferent, yet their alteration gives uneasiness. As 'tis
the nature of doubt to cause a variation in the thought, and transport us
suddenly from one idea to another, it must of consequence be the occasion of
pain. This pain chiefly takes place, where interest, relation, or the greatness
and novelty of any event interests us in it. 'Tis not every matter of fact, of
which we have a curiosity to be inform'd; neither are they such only as we have
an interest to know. 'Tis sufficient if the idea strikes on us with such force,
and concerns us so nearly, as to give us an uneasiness in its instability and
inconstancy. A stranger, when he arrives first at any town, may be entirely
|indifferent about knowing the history and adventures of the inhabitants; but as
he becomes farther acquainted with them, and has liv'd any considerable time
among them, he acquires the same curiosity as the natives. When we are reading
the history of a nation, we may have an ardent desire of clearing up any doubt
or difficulty, that occurs in it; but become careless in such researches, when
the ideas of these events are, in a great measure, obliterated.
