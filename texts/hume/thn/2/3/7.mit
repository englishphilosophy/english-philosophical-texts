{#1,pages=427} THERE is an easy reason, why every thing contiguous to us, either
in space or time, shou'd be conceiv'd with a peculiar force and vivacity, and
excel every other object, in its influence on the imagination. Ourself is
intimately present to us, and whatever is related to self must partake of that
quality. But where an object is so far remov'd as to have lost the advantage of
this relation, why, as it is farther remov'd, its idea becomes still fainter and
more obscure, wou'd, perhaps, require a more particular examination.

{#2,pages=427-8} '^Tis^ obvious, that the imagination can never totally forget
the points of space and time, in which we are existent; but |receives such
frequent advertisements of them from the passions and senses, that however it
may turn its attention to foreign and remote objects, it is necessitated every
moment to reflect on the present. 'Tis also remarkable, that in the conception
of those objects, which we regard as real and existent, we take them in their
proper order and situation, and never leap from one object to another, which is
distant from it, without running over, at least in a cursory manner, all those
objects, which are interpos'd betwixt them. When we reflect, therefore, on any
object distant from ourselves, we are oblig'd not only to reach it at first by
passing thro' all the intermediate space betwixt ourselves and the object, but
also to renew our progress every moment; being every moment recall'd to the
consideration of ourselves and our present situation. 'Tis easily conceiv'd,
that this interruption must weaken the idea by breaking the action of the mind,
and hindering the conception from being so intense and continu'd, as when we
reflect on a nearer object. The _fewer_ steps we make to arrive at the object,
and the _smoother_ the road is, this diminution of vivacity is less
{~~considerably->sensibly~~} felt, but still may be observ'd more or less in
proportion to the degrees of distance and difficulty.

{#3,pages=428-9} ^Here^ then we are to consider two kinds of objects, the
contiguous and remote; of which the former, by means of their relation to
ourselves, approach an impression in force and vivacity; the latter by reason of
the interruption in our manner of conceiving them, appear in a weaker and more
imperfect light. This is their effect on the imagination. If my reasoning be
just, they must have a proportionable effect on the will and passions.
Contiguous objects must have an influence much superior to the distant and
remote. Accordingly we find in common life, that men are principally concern'd
about those objects, which are not much remov'd either in space or time,
enjoying the present, and leaving what is afar off to the care of chance and
fortune. Talk to a man of his condition thirty years hence, and he will not
|regard you. Speak of what is to happen to-morrow, and he will lend you
attention. The breaking of a mirror gives us more concern when at home, than the
burning of a house, when abroad, and some hundred leagues distant.

{#4,pages=429} ^But^ farther; tho' distance both in space and time has a
considerable effect on the imagination, and by that means on the will and
passions, yet the consequence of a removal in _space_ are much inferior to those
of a removal in _time_. Twenty years are certainly but a small distance of time
in comparison of what history and even the memory of some may inform them of,
and yet I doubt if a thousand leagues, or even the greatest distance of place
this globe can admit of, will so remarkably weaken our ideas, and diminish our
passions. A _West-India_ merchant will tell you, that he is not without concern
about what passes in _Jamaica_; tho' few extend their views so far into
futurity, as to dread very remote accidents.

{#5,pages=429-30} ^The^ cause of this ph{ae}nomenon must evidently lie in the
different properties of space and time. Without having recourse to metaphysics,
any one may easily observe, that space or extension consists of a number of
co-existent parts dispos'd in a certain order, and capable of being at once
present to the sight or feeling. On the contrary, time or succession, tho' it
consists likewise of parts, never presents to us more than one at once; nor is
it possible for any two of them ever to be co-existent. These qualities of the
objects have a suitable effect on the imagination. The parts of extension being
susceptible of an union to the senses, acquire an union in the fancy; and as the
appearance of one part excludes not another, the transition or passage of the
thought thro' the contiguous parts is by that means render'd more smooth and
easy. On the other hand, the incompatibility of the parts of time in their real
existence separates them in the imagination, and makes it more _difficult_ for
that faculty to trace any long succession or series of events. Every part must
appear single and alone, nor |can regularly have entrance into the fancy without
banishing what is suppos'd to have been immediately precedent. By this means any
distance in time causes a greater interruption in the thought than an equal
distance in space, and consequently weakens more considerably the idea, and
consequently the passions; which depend in a great measure, on the imagination,
according to my system.

{#6,pages=430} ^There^ is another ph{ae}nomenon of a like nature with the
foregoing, viz. _the superior effects of the same distance in futurity above
that in the past_. This difference with respect to the will is easily accounted
for. As none of our actions can alter the past, 'tis not strange it shou'd never
determine the will. But with respect to the passions the question is yet entire,
and well worth the examining.

{#7,pages=430} ^Besides^ the propensity to a gradual progression thro' the
points of space and time, we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking,
which concurs in producing this ph{ae}nomenon. We always follow the succession
of time in placing our ideas, and from the consideration of any object pass more
easily to that, which follows immediately after it, than to that which went
before it. We may learn this, among other instances, from the order, which is
always observ'd in historical narrations. Nothing but an absolute necessity can
oblige an historian to break the order of time, and in his _narration_ give the
precedence to an event, which was in _reality_ posterior to another.

{#8,pages=430-1} ^This^ will easily be apply'd to the question in hand, if we
reflect on what I have before observ'd, that the present situation of the person
is always that of the imagination, and that 'tis from thence we proceed to the
conception of any distant object. When the object is past, the progression of
the thought in passing to it from the present is contrary to nature, as
proceeding from one point of time to that which is preceding, and from that to
another preceding, in opposition to the natural course of the succession. On the
other hand, when we turn our thought to a future object, our |fancy flows along
the stream of time, and arrives at the object by an order, which seems most
natural, passing always from one point of time to that which is immediately
posterior to it. This _easy_ progression of ideas favours the imagination, and
makes it conceive its object in a stronger and fuller light, than when we are
continually oppos'd in our passage, and are oblig'd to overcome the difficulties
arising from the natural propensity of the fancy. A small degree of distance in
the past has, therefore, a greater effect, in interupting and weakening the
conception, than a much greater in the future. From this effect of it on the
imagination is deriv'd its influence on the will and passions.

{#9,pages=431-2} ^There^ is another cause, which both contributes to the same
effect, and proceeds from the same quality of the fancy, by which we are
determin'd to trace the succession of time by a similar succession of ideas.
When from the present instant we consider two points of time equally distant in
the future and in the past, 'tis evident, that, abstractedly consider'd, their
relation to the present is almost equal. For as the future will _sometime_ be
present, so the past was _once_ present. If we cou'd, therefore, remove this
quality of the imagination, an equal distance in the past and in the future,
wou'd have a similar influence. Nor is this only true, when the fancy remains
fix'd, and from the present instant surveys the future and the past; but also
when it changes its situation, and places us in different periods of time. For
as on the one hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time
interpos'd betwixt the present instant and the future object, we find the future
object approach to us, and the past retire, and become more distant: So on the
other hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd
betwixt the present and the past, the past approaches to us, and the future
becomes more distant. But from the property of the fancy above-mention'd we
rather chuse to fix our thought on the point of time interpos'd betwixt the
present and the future, |than on that betwixt the present and the past. We
advance, rather than retard our existence; and following what seems the natural
succession of time, proceed from past to present, and from present to future. By
which means we conceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us, and the
past as retiring. An equal distance, therefore, in the past and in the future,
has not the same effect on the imagination; and that because we consider the one
as continually encreasing, and the other as continually diminishing. The fancy
anticipates the course of things, and surveys the object in that condition, to
which it tends, as well as in that, which is regarded as the present.
