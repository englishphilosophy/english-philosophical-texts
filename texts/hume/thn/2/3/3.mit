{#1,pages=413} NOTHING is more usual in philosophy, and even in common life,
than to talk of the combat of passion and reason, to give the preference to
reason, and assert that men are only so far virtuous as they conform themselves
to its dictates. Every rational creature, 'tis said, is oblig'd to regulate his
actions by reason; and if any other motive or principle challenge the direction
of his conduct, he ought to oppose it, 'till it be entirely subdu'd, or at least
brought to a conformity with that superior principle. On this method of thinking
the greatest part of moral philosophy, antient and modern, seems to be founded;
nor is there an ampler field, as well for metaphysical arguments, as popular
declamations, than this suppos'd pre-eminence of reason above passion. The
eternity, invariableness, and divine origin of the former have been display'd to
the best advantage: The blindness, unconstancy, and deceitfulness of the latter
have been as strongly insisted on. In order to shew the fallacy of all this
philosophy, I shall endeavour to prove _first_, that reason alone can never be a
motive to any action of the will; and _secondly_, that it can never oppose
passion in the direction of the will.

{#2,pages=413-4} ^The^ understanding exerts itself after two different ways, as
it judges from demonstration or probability; as it regards the abstract
relations of our ideas, or those relations of objects, of which experience only
gives us information. I believe it scarce will be asserted, that the first
species of reasoning alone is ever the cause of any action. As it's proper
province is the world of ideas, and as the will always places us in that of
realities, demonstration and volition seem, upon that account, to be totally
remov'd, from each other. Mathematics, indeed, are useful in all mechanical
operations, and arithmetic in almost every art and profession: But 'tis not of
themselves they have any influence. Mechanics are |the art of regulating the
motions of bodies _to some design'd end or purpose_; and the reason why we
employ arithmetic in fixing the proportions of numbers, is only that we may
discover the proportions of their influence and operation. A merchant is
desirous of knowing the sum total of his accounts with any person: Why? but that
he may learn what sum will have the same _effects_ in paying his debt, and going
to market, as all the particular articles taken together. Abstract or
demonstrative reasoning, therefore, never influences any of our actions, but
only as it directs our judgment concerning causes and effects; which leads us to
the second operation of the understanding.

{#3,pages=414} '^Tis^ obvious, that when we have the prospect of pain or
pleasure from any object, we feel a consequent emotion of aversion or
propensity, and are carry'd to avoid or embrace what will give us this
uneasiness or satisfaction. 'Tis also obvious, that this emotion rests not here,
but making us cast our view on every side, comprehends whatever objects are
connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect. Here then
reasoning takes place to discover this relation; and according as our reasoning
varies, our actions receive a subsequent variation. But 'tis evident in this
case, that the impulse arises not from reason, but is only directed by it. 'Tis
from the prospect of pain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises
towards any object: And these emotions extend themselves to the causes and
effects of that object, as they are pointed out to us by reason and experience.
It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and
such others effects, if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us. Where
the objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give them any
influence; and 'tis plain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this
connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us.

{#4,pages=414-5} ^Since^ reason alone can never produce any action, or give rise
to volition, I infer, that the same faculty is as incapable |of preventing
volition, or of disputing the preference with any passion or emotion. This
consequence is necessary. 'Tis impossible reason cou'd have the latter effect of
preventing volition, but by giving an impulse in a contrary direction to our
passion; and that impulse, had it operated alone, wou'd have been able to
produce volition. Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion, but a
contrary impulse; and if this contrary impulse ever arises from reason, that
latter faculty must have an original influence on the will, and must be able to
cause, as well as hinder any act of volition. But if reason has no original
influence, 'tis impossible it can withstand any principle, which has such an
efficacy, or ever keep the mind in suspence a moment. Thus it appears, that the
principle, which opposes our passion, cannot be the same with reason, and is
only call'd so in an improper sense. We speak not strictly and philosophically
when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only
to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than
to serve and obey them. As this opinion may appear somewhat extraordinary, it
may not be improper to confirm it by some other considerations.

{#5,pages=415} ^A passion^ is an original existence, or, if you will,
modification of existence, and contains not any representative quality, which
renders it a copy of any other existence or modification. When I am angry, I am
actually possest with the passion, and in that emotion have no more a reference
to any other object, than when I am thirsty, or sick, or more than five foot
high. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that this passion can be oppos'd by, or be
contradictory to truth and reason; since this contradiction consists in the
disagreement of ideas, consider'd as copies, with those objects, which they
represent.

{#6,pages=415-6} ^What^ may at first occur on this head, is, that as nothing can
be contrary to truth or reason, except what has a reference to it, and as the
judgments of our understanding |only have this reference, it must follow, that
passions can be contrary to reason only so far as they are _accompany'd_ with
some judgment or opinion. According to this principle, which is so obvious and
natural, 'tis only in two senses, that any affection can be call'd unreasonable.
First, When a passion, such as hope or fear, grief or joy, despair or security,
is founded on the supposition of the existence of objects, which really do not
exist. Secondly, When in exerting any passion in action, we chuse means
insufficient for the design'd end, and deceive ourselves in our judgment of
causes and effects. Where a passion is neither founded on false suppositions,
nor chuses means insufficient for the end, the understanding can neither justify
nor condemn it. 'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the
whole world to the scratching of my finger. 'Tis not contrary to reason for me
to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an _Indian_ or person
wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own
acknowledg'd lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the
former than the latter. A trivial good may, from certain circumstances, produce
a desire superior to what arises from the greatest and most valuable enjoyment;
nor is there any thing more extraordinary in this, than in mechanics to see one
pound weight raise up a hundred by the advantage of its situation. In short, a
passion must be accompany'd with some false judgment, in order to its being
unreasonable; and even then 'tis not the passion, properly speaking, which is
unreasonable, but the judgment.

{#7,pages=416-7} ^The^ consequences are evident. Since a passion can never, in
any sense, be call'd unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition, or
when it chuses means insufficient for the design'd end, 'tis impossible, that
reason and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the government of
the will and actions. The moment we perceive the falshood of any supposition, or
the insufficiency of any means our passions yield to our reason without any
opposition. I |may desire any fruit as of an excellent relish; but whenever you
convince me of my mistake, my longing ceases. I may will the performance of
certain actions as means of obtaining any desir'd good; but as my willing of
these actions is only secondary, and founded on the supposition, that they are
causes of the propos'd effect; as soon as I discover the falshood of that
supposition, they must become indifferent to me.

{#8,pages=417} '^Tis^ natural for one, that does not examine objects with a
strict philosophic eye, to imagine, that those actions of the mind are entirely
the same, which produce not a different sensation, and are not immediately
distinguishable to the feeling and perception. Reason, for instance, exerts
itself without producing any sensible emotion; and except in the more sublime
disquisitions of philosophy, or in the frivolous subtilties of the schools,
scarce ever conveys any pleasure or uneasiness. Hence it proceeds, that every
action of the mind, which operates with the same calmness and tranquillity, is
confounded with reason by all those, who judge of things from the first view and
appearance. Now 'tis certain, there are certain calm desires and tendencies,
which, tho' they be real passions, produce little emotion in the mind, and are
more known by their effects than by the immediate feeling or sensation. These
desires are of two kinds; either certain instincts originally implanted in our
natures, such as benevolence and resentment, the love of life, and kindness to
children; or the general appetite to good, and aversion to evil, consider'd
merely as such. When any of these passions are calm, and cause no disorder in
the soul, they are very readily taken for the determinations of reason, and are
suppos'd to proceed from the same faculty, with that, which judges of truth and
falshood. Their nature and principles have been suppos'd the same, because their
sensations are not evidently different.

{#9,pages=417-8} ^Beside^ these calm passions, which often determine the will,
there are certain violent emotions of the same kind, |which have likewise a
great influence on that faculty. When I receive any injury from another, I often
feel a violent passion of resentment, which makes me desire his evil and
punishment, independent of all considerations of pleasure and advantage to
myself{~~,->.~~} When I am immediately threaten'd with any grievous ill, my
fears, apprehensions, and aversions rise to a great height, and produce a
sensible emotion.

{#10,pages=418} ^The^ common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the
direction of the will entirely to one of these principles, and supposing the
other to have no influence. Men often act knowingly against their interest: For
which reason the view of the greatest possible good does not always influence
them. Men often counter-act a violent passion in prosecution of their interests
and designs: 'Tis not therefore the present uneasiness alone, which determines
them. In general we may observe, that both these principles operate on the will;
and where they are contrary, that either of them prevails, according to the
_general_ character or _present_ disposition of the person. What we call
strength of mind, implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent;
tho' we may easily observe, there is no man so constantly possess'd of this
virtue, as never on any occasion to yield to the sollicitations of passion and
desire. From these variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty of
deciding concerning the actions and resolutions of men, where there is any
contrariety of motives and passions.
