{#1,pages=618} THUS upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an
accurate proof of this system of ethics. We are certain, that sympathy is a very
powerful principle in human nature. We are also certain, that it has a great
influence on our sense of beauty, when we regard external objects, as well as
when we judge of morals. We find, that it has force sufficient to give us the
strongest sentiments of approbation, when it operates alone, without the
concurrence of any other principle; as in the cases of justice, allegiance,
chastity, and good-manners. We may observe, that all the circumstances requisite
for its operation are found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most
part, a tendency to the good of society, or to that of the person possess'd of
them. If we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy
is the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that no
objection can be rais'd against this hypothesis in one case, which will not
extend to all cases. Justice is certainly approv'd of for no other reason, than
because it has a tendency to the public good: And the public good is indifferent
to us, except so far as sympathy interests us in it. We may presume the like
with regard to all the other virtues, which have a like tendency to the public
good. They must derive all their merit from our sympathy with those, who reap
any advantage from them: As the virtues, which have a tendency to the good of
the person possess'd of them, derive their merit from our sympathy with him.

{#2,pages=618-9} ^Most^ people will readily allow, that the useful qualities of
the mind are virtuous, because of their utility. This way of thinking is so
natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple of
admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy must
necessarily be |acknowledg'd. Virtue is consider'd as means to an end. Means to
an end are only valued so far as the end is valued. But the happiness of
strangers affects us by sympathy alone. To that principle, therefore, we are to
ascribe the sentiment of approbation, which arises from the survey of all those
virtues, that are useful to society, or to the person possess'd of them. These
form the most considerable part of morality.//

{#3,pages=619} ^Were^ it proper in such a subject to bribe the readers assent,
or employ any thing but solid argument, we are here abundantly supplied with
topics to engage the affections. All lovers of virtue (and such we all are in
speculation, however we may degenerate in practice) must certainly be pleas'd to
see moral distinctions deriv'd from so noble a source, which gives us a just
notion both of the _generosity_ and _capacity_ of {~~human->our~~} nature. It
requires but very little knowledge of human affairs to perceive, that a sense of
morals is a principle inherent in the soul, and one of the most powerful that
enters into the composition. But this sense must certainly acquire new force,
when reflecting on itself, it approves of those principles, from whence it is
deriv'd, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin.
Those who resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind,
may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority; but want the
advantage, which those possess, who account for that sense by an extensive
sympathy with mankind. According to {~~their->the latter~~} system, not only
virtue must be approv'd of, but also the sense of virtue: And not only that
sense, but also the principles, from whence it is deriv'd. So that nothing is
presented on any side, but what is laudable and good.

{#4,pages=619-20} ^This^ observation may be extended to justice, and the other
virtues of that kind. Tho' justice be artificial, the sense of its morality is
natural. 'Tis the combination of men, in a system of conduct, which renders any
act of justice beneficial |to society. But when once it has that tendency, we
_naturally_ approve of it; and if we did not so, 'tis impossible any combination
or convention cou'd ever produce that sentiment.

{#5,pages=620} ^Most^ of the inventions of men are subject to change. They
depend upon humour and caprice. They have a vogue for a time, and then sink into
oblivion. It may, perhaps, be apprehended, that if justice were allow'd to be a
human invention, it must be plac'd on the same footing. But the cases are widely
different. The interest, on which justice is founded, is the greatest
imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It cannot possibly be serv'd by
any other invention. It is obvious, and discovers itself on the very first
formation of society. All these causes render the rules of justice stedfast and
immutable; at least, as immutable as human nature. And if they were founded on
original instincts, cou'd they have any greater stability?

{#6,pages=620-1} ^The^ same system may help us to form a just notion of the
_happiness_, as well as of the _dignity_ of virtue, and may interest every
principle of our nature in the embracing and cherishing that noble quality. Who
indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in his pursuits of knowledge and
ability of every kind, when he considers, that besides the advantage, which
immediately result from these acquisitions, they also give him a new lustre in
the eyes of mankind, and are universally attended with esteem and approbation?
And who can think any advantages of fortune a sufficient compensation for the
least breach of the _social_ virtues, when he considers, that not only his
character with regard to others, but also his peace and inward satisfaction
entirely depend upon his strict observance of them; and that a mind will never
be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and
society? But I forbear insisting on this subject. Such reflections require a
work a-part, very different from the genius of the present. The anatomist ought
never to emulate the painter; nor in his accurate dissections and portraitures
of the smaller parts of the human body, pretend |to give his figures any
graceful and engaging attitude or expression. There is even something hideous,
or at least minute in the views of things, which he presents; and 'tis necessary
the objects shou'd be set more at a distance, and be more cover'd up from sight,
to make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An anatomist, however, is
admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and 'tis even impracticable to
excel in the latter art, without the assistance of the former. We must have an
exact knowledge of the parts, their situation and connexion, before we can
design with any elegance or correctness. And thus the most abstract speculations
concerning human nature, however cold and unentertaining, become subservient to
_practical morality_; and may render this latter science more correct in its
precepts, and more persuasive in its exhortations.
