{#1,pages=539-40} THOUGH government be an invention very advantageous, and even
in some circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind; it is not necessary in
all circumstances, nor is it impossible for men to preserve society for some
time, without having recourse to such an invention. Men, 'tis true, are always
much inclin'd to prefer present interest to distant and remote; nor is it easy
for them to resist the temptation of any advantage, that they may immediately
enjoy, in apprehension of an evil, that lies at a distance from them: But still
this weakness is less conspicuous, where the possessions, and the pleasures of
life are few, and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of society.
An _Indian_ is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut, or to steal
his bow, as being already provided of the same advantages; and as to any
superior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting and fishing,
'tis only casual and temporary, and will have but small tendency to disturb
society. And so far am I from thinking with some philosophers, that men are
utterly incapable of society without government, that I assert the |first
rudiments of government to arise from quarrels, not among men of the same
society, but among those of different societies. A less degree of riches will
suffice to this latter effect, than is requisite for the former. Men fear
nothing from public war and violence but the resistance they meet with, which,
because they share it in common, seems less terrible; and because it comes from
strangers, seems less pernicious in its consequences, than when they are expos'd
singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them, and without whose
society 'tis impossible they can subsist. Now foreign war to a society without
government necessarily produces civil war. Throw any considerable goods among
men, they instantly fall a quarrelling, while each strives to get possession of
what pleases him, without regard to the consequences. In a foreign war the most
considerable of all goods, life and limbs, are at stake; and as every one shuns
dangerous {~~ports->posts~~}, seizes the best arms, seeks excuse for the
slightest wounds, {~~the laws->the rules of society~~}, which may be well enough
observ'd, while men were calm, can now no longer take place, when they are in
such commotion.

{#2,pages=540-1} ^This^ we find verified in the _American_ tribes, where men
live in concord and amity among themselves without any establish'd government;
and never pay submission to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when
their captain enjoys a shadow of authority, which he loses after their return
from the field, and the establishment of peace with the neighbouring tribes.
This authority, however, instructs them in the advantages of government, and
teaches them to have recourse to it, when either by the pillage of war, by
commerce, or by any fortuitous inventions, their riches and possessions have
become so considerable as to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest
they have in the preservation of peace and justice. Hence we may give a
plausible reason, among others, why all governments are at first monarchical,
without any mixture and variety; and why republics arise only from the abuses of
monarchy and despotic power. Camps are the |true mothers of cities; and as war
cannot be administred, by reason of the suddenness of every exigency, without
some authority in a single person, the same kind of authority naturally takes
place in that civil government, which succeeds the military. And this reason I
take to be more natural, than the common one deriv'd from patriarchal
government, or the authority of a father, which is said first to take place in
one family, and to accustom the members of it to the government of a single
person. The state of society without government is one of the most natural
states of men, and {~~must->may~~} subsist with the conjunction of many
families, and long after the first generation. Nothing but an encrease of riches
and possessions cou'd oblige men to quit it; and so barbarous and uninstructed
are all societies on their first formation, that many years must elapse before
these {~~can->cou'd~~} encrease to such a degree, as to disturb men in the
enjoyment of peace and concord.

{#3,pages=541-2} ^But^ tho' it be possible for men to maintain a small
uncultivated society without government, 'tis impossible they shou'd maintain a
society of any kind without justice, and the observance of those three
fundamental laws concerning the stability of possession, its translation by
consent, and the performance of promises. These are, therefore, antecedent to
government, and are suppos'd to impose an obligation before the duty of
allegiance to civil magistrates has once been thought of. Nay, I shall go
farther, and assert, that government, _upon its first establishment_, wou'd
naturally be suppos'd to derive its obligation from those laws of nature, and,
in particular, from that concerning the performance of promises. When men have
once perceiv'd the necessity of government to maintain peace, and execute
justice, they wou'd naturally assemble together, wou'd chuse magistrates,
determine their power, and _promise_ them obedience. As a promise is suppos'd to
be a bond or security already in use, and attended with a moral obligation, 'tis
to be consider'd as the original sanction of government, and as the source of
the first obligation to obedience. This reasoning appears so natural, that |it
has become the foundation of our fashionable system of politics, and is in a
manner the creed of a party amongst us, who {~~pride->value~~} themselves, with
reason, on the soundness of their philosophy, and their liberty of thought. _All
men_, say they, _are born free and equal: Government and superiority can only be
establish'd by consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes
on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are
bound to obey their magistrates, only because they promise it_;_ and if they had
not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve allegiance, it
would never have become a part of their moral duty_. This conclusion, however,
when carried so far as to comprehend government in all its ages and situations,
is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that tho' the duty of allegiance be at
first grafted on the obligation of promises, and be for some time supported by
that obligation, yet {~~it quickly->as soon as the advantages of government are
fully known and acknowledg'd, it immediately~~} takes root of itself, and has an
original obligation and authority, independent of all contracts. This is a
principle of moment, which we must examine with care and attention, before we
proceed any farther.

{#4,pages=542-3} '^Tis^ reasonable for those philosophers, who assert justice to
be a natural virtue, and antecedent to human conventions, to resolve all civil
allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and assert that 'tis our own
consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy. For as all
government is plainly an invention of men, and the origin of most governments is
known in history, 'tis necessary to mount higher, in order to find the source of
our political duties, if we wou'd assert them to have any _natural_ obligation
of morality. These philosophers, therefore, quickly observe, that society is as
antient as the human species, and those three fundamental laws of nature as
antient as society: So that taking advantage of the antiquity, and obscure
origin of these laws, they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary
inventions of men, and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties, which
are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceiv'd in this |particular, and
having found that _natural_, as well as _civil_ justice, derives its origin from
human conventions, we shall quickly perceive, how fruitless it is to resolve the
one into the other, and seek, in the laws of nature, a stronger foundation for
our political duties than interest, and human conventions; while these laws
themselves are built on the very same foundation. On which ever side we turn
this subject, we shall find, that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the
same footing, and have the same source both of their _first invention_ and
_moral obligation_. They are contriv'd to remedy like inconveniences, and
acquire their moral sanction in the same manner, from their remedying those
inconveniences. These are two points, which we {--we--} shall endeavour to prove
as distinctly as possible.

{#5,pages=543-4} ^We^ have already shewn, that men _invented_ the three
fundamental laws of nature, when they observ'd the necessity of society to their
mutual subsistance, and found, that 'twas impossible to maintain any
correspondence together, without some restraint on their natural appetites. The
same self-love, therefore, which renders men so incommodious to each other,
taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of justice, and
is the _first_ motive of their observance. But when men have observ'd, that tho'
the rules of justice be sufficient to maintain any society, yet 'tis impossible
for them, of themselves, to observe those rules, in large and polish'd
societies; they establish government, as a new invention to attain their ends,
and preserve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more strict execution of
justice. So far, therefore, our _civil_ duties are connected with our _natural_,
that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the latter; and that the
principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of
nature. In this respect, however, that law of nature, concerning the performance
of promises, is only compriz'd along with the rest; and its exact observance is
to be consider'd as an effect of the institution of government, and not the
obedience to government as an effect of the obligation of a promise. Tho' the
object of our |civil duties be the enforcing of our natural, yet the[n79]
_first_ motive of the invention, as well as performance of both, is nothing but
self-interest: And since there is a separate interest in the obedience to
government, from that in the performance of promises, we must also allow of a
separate obligation. To obey the civil magistrate is requisite to preserve order
and concord in society. To perform promises is requisite to beget mutual trust
and confidence in the common offices of life. The ends, as well as the means,
are perfectly distinct; nor is the one subordinate to the other.

{#6,pages=544-5} ^To^ make this more evident, let us consider, that men will
often bind themselves by promises to the performance of what it wou'd have been
their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they wou'd
give others a fuller security, by super-adding a new obligation of interest to
that which they formerly lay under. The interest in the performance of promises,
besides its moral obligation, is general, avow'd, and of the last consequence in
life. Other interests may be more particular and doubtful; and we are apt to
entertain a greater suspicion, that men may indulge their humour, or passion, in
acting contrary to them. Here, therefore, promises come naturally in play, and
are often requir'd for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing those
other interests to be as general and avow'd as the interest in the performance
of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing, and men will begin
to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is exactly the case with regard
to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate; without which no government
cou'd subsist, nor any peace or order be maintain'd in large societies, where
there are so many possessions on the one hand, and so many wants, real or
imaginary, on the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach
themselves from our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The
interest in both is of the very same kind: 'Tis general, avow'd, and prevails in
all |times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding the one
upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar to itself. We might
as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the possessions of others, into
the obligation of a promise, as that of allegiance. The interests are not more
distinct in the one case than the other. A regard to property is not more
necessary to natural society, than obedience is to civil society or government;
nor is the former society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the
latter to their well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of
promises be advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest
be general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avow'd, so is
the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of interest,
each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of the other.

{#7,pages=545-6} ^But^ 'tis not only the _natural_ obligations of interest,
which are distinct in promises and allegiance; but also the _moral_ obligations
of honour and conscience: Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend in the
least upon that of the other. And indeed, if we consider the close connexion
there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we shall find this
conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest is always engag'd on the
side of obedience to magistracy; and there is nothing but a great present
advantage, that can lead us to rebellion, by making us over-look the remote
interest, which we have in the preserving of peace and order in society. But
tho' a present interest may thus blind us with regard to our own actions, it
takes not place with regard to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing
in their true colours, as highly prejudicial to {~~public interest, and to our
own in particular->our own interest, or at least to that of the public, which we
partake of by _sympathy_~~}. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in
considering such seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the
idea of vice and moral deformity. 'Tis the same principle, which causes us to
disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the breach of
pro|mises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because we consider, that
the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with
regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty to magistrates; because we perceive,
that the execution of justice, in the stability of possession, its translation
by consent, and the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission
to government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each
other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate and
independant. Tho' there was no such thing as a promise in the world, government
wou'd still be necessary in all large and civiliz'd societies; and if promises
had only their own proper obligation, without the separate sanction of
government, they wou'd have but little efficacy in such societies. This
separates the boundaries of our public and private duties, and shews that the
latter are more dependant on the former, than the former on the latter.
_Education_, and _the artifice of politicians_, concur {~~to bestow->in
bestowing~~} a farther morality on loyalty, and {~~to brand->branding~~} all
rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy. Nor is it a wonder, that
politicians shou'd be very industrious in inculcating such notions, where their
interest is so particularly concern'd.

{#8,pages=546-7} ^Lest^ those arguments shou'd not appear entirely conclusive
(as I think they are) I shall have recourse to authority, and shall prove, from
the universal consent of mankind, that the obligation of submission to
government is not deriv'd from any promise of the subjects. Nor need any one
wonder, that tho' I have all along endeavour'd to establish my system on pure
reason, and have scarce ever cited the judgment even of philosophers or
historians on any article, I shou'd now appeal to popular authority, and oppose
the sentiments of the rabble to any philosophical reasoning. {~~But->For~~} it
must be observ'd, that the opinions of men, in this case, carry with them a
peculiar authority, and are, in a great measure, infallible. The distinction of
moral good and evil is founded on the pleasure or pain, which results from the
view of any sentiment, or |character; and as that pleasure or pain cannot be
unknown to the person who feels it, it follows,[n80] that there is just so much
vice or virtue in any character, as every one places in it, and that 'tis
impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken. And tho' our judgments
concerning the _origin_ of any vice or virtue, be not so certain as those
concerning their _degrees_; yet, since the question in this case regards not any
philosophical origin of an obligation, but a plain matter of fact, 'tis not
easily conceiv'd how we can fall into an error. A man, who acknowledges himself
to be bound to another, for a certain sum, must certainly know whether it be by
his own bond, or that of his father; whether it be of his mere good-will, or for
money lent him; and under what conditions, and for what purposes he has bound
himself. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral obligation to
submit to government, because every one thinks so; it must be as certain, that
this obligation arises not from a promise; since no one, whose judgment has not
been led astray by too strict adherence to a system of philosophy, has ever yet
dreamt of ascribing it to that origin. Neither magistrates nor subjects have
form'd this idea of our civil duties.

{#9,pages=547-9} ^We^ find, that magistrates are so far from deriving their
authority, and the obligation to obedience in their subjects, from the
foundation of a promise or original contract, that they conceal, as far as
possible, from their people, especially from the vulgar, that they have their
origin from thence. Were this the sanction of government, our rulers wou'd never
receive it tacitly, which is the utmost that can be pretended; since what is
given tacitly and insensibly can never have such influence on mankind, as what
is perform'd expressly and openly. A tacit promise is, where the will is
signified by |other more diffuse signs than those of speech; but a will there
must certainly be in the case, and that can never escape the person's notice,
who exerted it, however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest
part of the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their
rulers, or promis'd to obey them, they wou'd be inclin'd to think very strangely
of you; and wou'd certainly reply, that the affair depended not on their
consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. In consequence of this
opinion, we frequently see them imagine such persons to be their natural rulers,
as are at that time depriv'd of all power and authority, and whom no man,
however foolish, wou'd voluntarily chuse; and this merely because they are in
that line, which rul'd before, and in that degree of it, which us'd to succeed;
tho' perhaps in so distant a period, that scarce any man alive cou'd ever have
given any promise of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over such
as these, because they never consented to it, and wou'd esteem the very attempt
of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety? We find by experience,
that it punishes them very freely for what it calls treason and rebellion,
which, it seems, according to this system, reduces itself to common injustice.
If you say, that by dwelling in its dominions, they in effect consented to the
establish'd government; I answer, that this can only be, where they think the
affair depends on their choice, which few or none, beside those philosophers,
have ever yet imagin'd. It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel, that the
first act he perform'd, after he came to years of discretion, was to levy war
against the sovereign of the state; and that while he was a child he cou'd not
bind himself by his own consent, and having become a man, show'd plainly, by the
first act he perform'd, that he had no design to impose on himself any
obligation to obedience. We find, on the contrary, that civil laws punish this
crime at the same age as any other, which is criminal, of itself, without our
consent; that is, when the person is come to the full use of reason: |Whereas to
this crime {~~it->they~~} ought in justice to allow some intermediate time, in
which a tacit consent at least might be suppos'd. To which we may add, that a
man living under an absolute government, wou'd owe it no allegiance; since, by
its very nature, it depends not on consent. But as that is as _natural_ and
_common_ a government as any, it must certainly occasion some obligation; and
'tis plain from experience, that men, who are subjected to it, do always think
so. This is a clear proof, that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be
deriv'd from our consent or promise; and a farther proof is, that when our
promise is upon any account expressly engag'd, we always distinguish exactly
betwixt the two obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other,
than in a repetition of the same promise. Where no promise is given, a man looks
not on his faith as broken in private matters, upon account of rebellion; but
keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate.
As the uniting of them was thought by these philosophers a very
{~~subtle->subtile~~} invention, this is a convincing proof, that 'tis not a
true one; since no man can either give a promise, or be restrain'd by its
sanction and obligation unknown to himself.

{#n79,pages=544} First in time, not in dignity or force.

{#n80,pages=547} This proposition must hold strictly true, with regard to every
quality, that is determin'd merely by sentiment. In what sense we can talk
either of a _right_ or a _wrong_ taste in morals, eloquence, or beauty, shall be
consider'd afterwards. In the mean time, it may be observ'd, that there is such
an uniformity in the _general_ sentiments of mankind, as to render such
questions of but small importance.
