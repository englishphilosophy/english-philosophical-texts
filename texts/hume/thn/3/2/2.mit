£4 _Of the origin of justice and property._ £4

{#1,pages=484} WE now proceed to examine two questions, viz. _concerning the
manner, in which the rules of justice are establish'd by the artifice of men_;
and _concerning the reasons_, _which determine us to attribute to the observance
or neglect of these rules a moral beauty and deformity_. These questions will
appear afterwards to be distinct. We shall begin with the former.//

{#2,pages=484-5} ^Of^ all the animals, with which this globe is peopled, there
is none towards whom nature seems, at first sight, to have exercis'd more
cruelty than towards man, in the numberless wants and necessities, with which
she has loaded him, and in the slender means, which she affords to the relieving
these necessities. In other creatures these two particulars generally compensate
each other. If we consider the lion as a |voracious and carnivorous animal, we
shall easily discover him to be very necessitous; but if we turn our eye to his
make and temper, his agility, his courage, his arms, and his force, we shall
find, that his advantages hold proportion with his wants. The sheep and ox are
depriv'd of all these advantages; but their appetites are moderate, and their
food is of easy purchase. In man alone, this unnatural conjunction of infirmity,
and of necessity, may be observ'd in its greatest perfection. Not only the food,
which is requir'd for his sustenance, flies his search and approach, or at least
requires his labour to be produc'd, but he must be possess'd of cloaths and
lodging, to defend him against the injuries of the weather; tho' to consider him
only in himself, he is provided neither with arms, nor force, nor other natural
abilities, which are in any degree answerable to so many necessities.

{#3,pages=485} '^Tis^ by society alone he is able to supply his defects, and
raise himself up to an equality with his fellow-creatures, and even acquire a
superiority above them. By society all his infirmities are compensated; and tho'
in that situation his wants multiply every moment upon him, yet his abilities
are still more augmented, and leave him in every respect more satisfied and
happy than 'tis possible for him, in his savage and solitary condition, ever to
become. When every individual person labours a-part, and only for himself, his
force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employ'd
in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any
particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the
least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable
ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these _three_ inconveniences. By
the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of
employments, our ability encreases: And by mutual succour we are less expos'd to
fortune and accidents. 'Tis by this additional _force_, _ability_, and
_security_, that society becomes advantageous.

{#4,pages=486} ^But^ in order to form society, 'tis requisite not only that it
be advantageous, but also that men be sensible of {~~these->its~~} advantages;
and 'tis impossible, in their wild uncultivated state, that by study and
reflection alone, they should ever be able to attain this knowledge. Most
fortunately, therefore, there is conjoin'd to those necessities, whose remedies
are remote and obscure, another necessity, which having a present and more
obvious remedy, may justly be regarded as the first and original principle of
human society. This necessity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the
sexes, which unites them together, and preserves their union, till a new tye
takes place in their concern for their common offspring. This new concern
becomes also a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a
more numerous society; where the parents govern by the advantage of their
superior strength and wisdom, and at the same time are restrain'd in the
exercise of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their
children. In a little time, custom and habit operating on the tender minds of
the children, makes them sensible of the advantages, which they may reap from
society, as well as fashions them by degrees for it, by rubbing off those rough
corners and untoward affections, which prevent their coalition.

{#5,pages=486-7} ^For^ it must be confest, that however the circumstances of
human nature may render an union necessary, and however those passions of lust
and natural affection may seem to render it unavoidable; yet there are other
particulars in our _natural temper_, and in our _outward circumstances_, which
are very incommodious, and are even contrary to the requisite conjunction. Among
the former, we may justly esteem our _selfishness_ to be the most considerable.
I am sensible, that, generally speaking, the representations of this quality
have been carried much too far; and that the descriptions, which certain
philosophers delight so much to form of mankind in this particular, are as wide
of nature as any accounts of monsters, which we meet with in fables and
|romances. So far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond
themselves, I am of opinion, that tho' it be rare to meet with one, who loves
any single person better than himself; yet 'tis as rare to meet with one, in
whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not over-balance all the
selfish. Consult common experience: Do you not see, that tho' the whole expence
of the family be generally under the direction of the master of it, yet there
are few that do not bestow the largest part of their fortunes on the pleasures
of their wives, and the education of their children, reserving the smallest
portion for their own proper use and entertainment{~~.->?~~} This is what we may
observe concerning such as have those endearing ties; and may presume, that the
case would be the same with others, were they plac'd in a like situation.

{#6,pages=487} ^But^ tho' this generosity must be acknowledg'd to the honour of
human nature, we may at the same time remark, that so noble an affection,
instead of fitting men for large societies, is almost as contrary to them, as
the most narrow selfishness. For while each person loves himself better than any
other single person, and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to
his relations and acquaintance, this must necessarily produce an opposition of
passions, and a consequent opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous
to the new-establish'd union.

{#7,pages=487-8} '^Tis^ however worth while to remark, that this contrariety of
passions wou'd be attended with but small danger, did it not concur with a
peculiarity in our _outward circumstances_, which affords it an opportunity of
exerting itself. There are three different species of goods, which we are
possess'd of; the internal satisfaction of our {~~minds->mind~~}, the external
advantages of our body, and the enjoyment of such possessions as we have
acquir'd by our industry and good fortune. We are perfectly secure in the
enjoyment of the first. The second may be ravish'd from us, but can be of no
advantage to him who deprives us of them. The last only are both expos'd to the
violence of others, and may be transferr'd without suffer|ing any loss or
alteration; while at the same time, there is not a sufficient quantity of them
to supply every one's desires and necessities. As the improvement, therefore, of
these goods is the chief advantage of society, so the _instability_ of their
possession, along with their _scarcity_, is the chief impediment.

{#8,pages=488-9} ^In^ vain shou'd we expect to find, in _uncultivated nature_, a
remedy to this inconvenience; or hope for any inartificial principle of the
human mind, which might controul those partial affections, and make us overcome
the temptations arising from our circumstances. The idea of justice can never
serve to this purpose, or be taken for a natural principle, capable of inspiring
men with an equitable conduct towards each other. That virtue, as it is now
understood, wou'd never have been dream'd of among rude and savage men. For the
notion of injury or injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against
some other person: And as every immorality is deriv'd from some defect or
unsoundness of the passions, and as this defect must be judg'd of, in a great
measure, from the ordinary course of nature in the constitution of the mind;
'twill be easy to know, whether we be guilty of any immorality, with regard to
others, by considering the natural, and usual force of those several affections,
which are directed towards them. Now it appears, that in the original frame of
our mind, our strongest attention is confin'd to ourselves; our next is extended
to our relations and acquaintance; and 'tis only the weakest which reaches to
strangers and indifferent persons. This partiality, then, and unequal affection,
must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct in society, but
even on our ideas of vice and virtue; so as to make us regard any remarkable
transgression of such a degree of partiality, either by too great an
enlargement, or contraction of the affections, as vicious and immoral. This we
may observe in our common judgments concerning actions, where we blame a person,
who either centers all his affections in his family, or |is so regardless of
them, as, in any opposition of interest, to give the preference to a stranger,
or mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural
uncultivated ideas of morality, instead of providing a remedy for the partiality
of our affections, do rather conform themselves to that partiality, and give it
an additional force and influence.

{#9,pages=489} ^The^ remedy, then, is not deriv'd from nature, but from
_artifice_; or more properly speaking, nature provides a remedy in the judgment
and understanding, for what is irregular and incommodious in the affections. For
when men, from their early education in society, have become sensible of the
infinite advantages that result from it, and have besides acquir'd a new
affection to company and conversation; and when they have observ'd, that the
principal disturbance in society arises from those goods, which we call
external, and from their looseness and easy transition from one person to
another; they must seek for a remedy, by putting these goods, as far as
possible, on the same footing with the fix'd and constant advantages of the mind
and body. This can be done after no other manner, than by a convention enter'd
into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of
those external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he
may acquire by his fortune and industry. By this means, every one knows what he
may safely possess; and the passions are restrain'd in their partial and
contradictory motions. Nor is such a restraint contrary to these passions; for
if so, it cou'd never be enter'd into, nor maintain'd; but it is only contrary
to their heedless and impetuous movement. Instead of departing from our own
interest, or from that of our nearest friends, by abstaining from the
possessions of others, we cannot better consult both these interests, than by
such a convention; because it is by that means we maintain society, which is so
necessary to their well-being and subsistence, as well as to our own.

{#10,pages=490} ^This^ convention is not of the nature of a _promise:_ For even
promises themselves, as we shall see afterwards, arise from human conventions.
It is only a general sense of common interest; which sense all the members of
the society express to one another, and which induces them to regulate their
conduct by certain rules. I observe, that it will be for my interest to leave
another in the possession of his goods, _provided_ he will act in the same
manner with regard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of
his conduct. When this common sense of interest is mutually express'd, and is
known to both, it produces a suitable resolution and behaviour. And this may
properly enough be call'd a convention or agreement betwixt us, tho' without the
interposition of a promise; since the actions of each of us have a reference to
those of the other, and are perform'd upon the supposition, that something is to
be perform'd on the other part. Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by
an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other.
Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from
human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow
progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of
transgressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that
the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a
confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the
expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded. In like
manner are languages gradually establish'd by human conventions without any
promise. In like manner do gold and silver become the common measures of
exchange, and are esteem'd sufficient payment for what is of a hundred times
their value.

{#11,pages=490-1} ^After^ this convention, concerning abstinence from the
possessions of others, is enter'd into, and every one has acquir'd a stability
in his possessions, there immediately arise the ideas of justice and injustice;
as also those of _property_, |_right_, and _obligation_. The latter are
altogether unintelligible without first understanding the former. Our property
is nothing but those goods, whose constant possession is establish'd by the laws
of society; that is, by the laws of justice. Those, therefore, who make use of
the words _property_, or _right_, or _obligation_, before they have explain'd
the origin of justice, or even make use of {~~it->them~~} in that explication,
are guilty of a very gross fallacy, and can never reason upon any solid
foundation. A man's property is some object related to him. This relation is not
natural, but moral, and founded on justice. 'Tis very preposterous, therefore,
to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully comprehending
the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of
men. The origin of justice explains that of property{~~,->.~~} The same artifice
gives rise to both. As our first and most natural sentiment of morals is founded
on the nature of our passions, and gives the preference to ourselves and
friends, above strangers; 'tis impossible there can be naturally any such thing
as a fix'd right or property, while the opposite passions of men impel them in
contrary directions, and are not restrain'd by any convention or agreement.

{#12,pages=491-2} ^No^ one can doubt, that the convention for the distinction of
property, and for the stability of possession, is of all circumstances the most
necessary to the establishment of human society, and that after the agreement
for the fixing and observing of this rule, there remains little or nothing to be
done towards settling a perfect harmony and concord. All the other passions,
beside this of interest, are either easily restrain'd, or are not of such
pernicious consequence, when indulg'd. _Vanity_ is rather to be esteem'd a
social passion, and a bond of union among men. _Pity_ and _love_ are to be
consider'd in the same light. And as to _envy_ and _revenge_, tho' pernicious,
they operate only by intervals, and are directed against particular persons,
whom we consider as our superiors or enemies. This avidity alone, of acquiring
|goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is insatiable,
perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society. There scarce is any
one, who is not actuated by it; and there is no one, who has not reason to fear
from it, when it acts without any restraint, and gives way to its first and most
natural movements. So that upon the whole, we are to esteem the difficulties in
the establishment of society, to be greater or less, according to those we
encounter in regulating and restraining this passion.

{#13,pages=492} '^Tis^ certain, that no affection of the human mind has both a
sufficient force, and a proper direction to counter-balance the love of gain,
and render men fit members of society, by making them abstain from the
possessions of others. Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this purpose;
and as to the other passions, they rather inflame this avidity, when we observe,
that the larger our possessions are, the more ability we have of gratifying all
our appetites. There is no passion, therefore, capable of controlling the
interested affection, but the very affection it self, by an alteration of its
direction. Now this alteration must necessarily take place upon the least
reflection; since 'tis evident, that the passion is much better satisfy'd by its
restraint, than by its liberty, and that {~~in->by~~} preserving society, we
make much greater advances in the acquiring possessions, than {~~in->by running
into~~} the solitary and forlorn condition, which must follow upon violence and
an universal licence. The question, therefore, concerning the wickedness or
goodness of human nature, enters not in the least into that other question
concerning the origin of society; nor is there any thing to be consider'd but
the degrees of men's sagacity or folly. For whether the passion of self-interest
be esteemed vicious or virtuous, 'tis all a case; since itself alone restrains
it: So that if it be virtuous, men become social by their virtue; if vicious,
their vice has the same effect.

{#14,pages=492-3} ^Now^ as 'tis by establishing the rule for the stability of
|possession, that this passion restrains itself; if that rule be very abstruse,
and of difficult invention; society must be esteem'd, in a manner, accidental,
and the effect of many ages. But if it be found, that nothing can be more simple
and obvious than that rule; that every parent, in order to preserve peace among
his children, must establish it; and that these first rudiments of justice must
every day be improv'd, as the society enlarges: If all this appear evident, as
it certainly must, we may conclude, that 'tis utterly impossible for men to
remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society;
but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem'd social. This,
however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, extend their
reasoning to the suppos'd _state of nature_; provided they allow it to be a mere
philosophical fiction, which never had, and never cou'd have any reality. Human
nature being compos'd of two principal parts, which are requisite in all its
actions, the affections and understanding; 'tis certain, that the blind motions
of the former, without the direction of the latter, incapacitate men for
society: And it may be allow'd us to consider separately the effects, that
result from the separate operations of these two component parts of the mind.
The same liberty may be permitted to moral, which is allow'd to natural
philosophers; and 'tis very usual with the latter to consider any motion as
compounded and consisting of two parts separate from each other, tho' at the
same time they acknowledge it to be in itself uncompounded and inseparable.

{#15,pages=493-4} ^This^ _state of nature_, therefore, is to be regarded as a
mere fiction, not unlike that of the _golden age_, which poets have invented;
only with this difference, that the former is describ'd as full of war, violence
and injustice; whereas the latter is painted out to us, as the most charming and
most peaceable condition, that can possibly be imagin'd. The seasons, in that
first age of nature, were so temperate, if we may believe the poets, that there
was no necessity for men to provide them|selves with cloaths and houses as a
security against the violence of heat and cold. The rivers flow'd with wine and
milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature spontaneously produc'd her greatest
delicacies. Nor were these the chief advantages of that happy age. The storms
and tempests were not alone remov'd from nature; but those more furious tempests
were unknown to human breasts, which now cause such uproar, and engender such
confusion. Avarice, ambition, cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cordial
affection, compassion, sympathy, were the only movements, with which the human
mind was yet acquainted. Even the distinction of _mine_ and _thine_ was banish'd
from that happy race of mortals, and carry'd with them the very notions of
property and obligation, justice and injustice.

{#16,pages=494-5} ^This^, no doubt, is to be regarded as an idle fiction; but
yet deserves our attention, because nothing can more evidently shew the origin
of those virtues, which are the subjects of our present enquiry. I have already
observ'd, that justice takes its rise from human conventions; and that these are
intended as a remedy to some inconveniences, which proceed from the concurrence
of certain _qualities_ of the human mind with the _situation_ of external
objects. The qualities of the mind are _selfishness_ and _limited generosity:_
And the situation of external objects is their _easy change_, join'd to their
_scarcity_ in comparison of the wants and desires of men. But however
philosophers may have been bewilder'd in those speculations, poets have been
guided more infallibly, by a certain taste or common instinct, which in most
kinds of reasoning goes farther than any of that art and philosophy, with which
we have been yet acquainted. They easily perceiv'd, if every man had a tender
regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires,
that the jealousy of interest, which justice supposes, could no longer have
place; nor would there be any occasion for those distinctions and limits of
property and possession, which at present are in use among mankind. Encrease to
a sufficient degree the bene|volence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you
render justice useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues, and
more valuable blessings. The selfishness of men is animated by the few
possessions we have, in proportion to our wants; and 'tis to restrain this
selfishness, that men have been oblig'd to separate themselves from the
community, and to distinguish betwixt their own goods and those of others.

{#17,pages=495} ^Nor^ need we have recourse to the fictions of poets to learn
this; but beside the reason of the thing, may discover the same truth by common
experience and observation. 'Tis easy to remark, that a cordial affection
renders all things common among friends; and that married people in particular
mutually lose their property, and are unacquainted with the _mine_ and _thine_,
which are so necessary, and yet cause such disturbance in human society. The
same effect arises from any alteration in the circumstances of mankind; as when
there is such a plenty of any thing as satisfies all the desires of men: In
which case the distinction of property is entirely lost, and every thing remains
in common. This we may observe with regard to air and water, tho' the most
valuable of all external objects; and may easily conclude, that if men were
supplied with every thing in the same abundance, or if _every one_ had the same
affection and tender regard for _every one_ as for himself; justice and
injustice would be equally unknown among mankind.

{#18,pages=495} ^Here^ then is a proposition, which, I think, may be regarded as
certain, _that 'tis only from the selfishness and confin'd generosity of men,
along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice
derives its origin_. If we look backward we shall find, that this proposition
bestows an additional force on some of those observations, which we have already
made on this subject.

{#19,pages=495-6} _First_, we may conclude from it, that a regard to public
interest, or a strong extensive benevolence, is not our first and original
motive for the observation of the rules of jus|tice; since 'tis allow'd, that if
men were endow'd with such a benevolence, these rules would never have been
dreamt of.

{#20,pages=496} _Secondly_, we may conclude from the same principle, that the
sense of justice is not founded on reason, or on the discovery of certain
connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and universally
obligatory. For since it is confest, that such an alteration as that
above-mention'd, in the temper and circumstances of mankind, wou'd entirely
alter our duties and obligations, 'tis necessary upon the common system, _that
the sense of virtue is deriv'd from reason_, to shew the change which this must
produce in the relations and ideas. But 'tis evident, that the only cause, why
the extensive generosity of man, and the perfect abundance of every thing, wou'd
destroy the very idea of justice, is because they render it useless; and that,
on the other hand, his confin'd benevolence, and his necessitous condition, give
rise to that virtue, only by making it requisite to the publick interest, and to
that of every individual. 'Twas therefore a concern for our own, and the publick
interest, which made us establish the laws of justice; and nothing can be more
certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas, which gives us this concern,
but our impressions and sentiments, without which every thing in nature is
perfectly indifferent to us; and can never in the least affect us. The sense of
justice, therefore, is not founded on our ideas, but on our impressions.

{#21,pages=496-7} _Thirdly_, we may farther confirm the foregoing proposition,
_that those impressions, which give rise to this sense of justice, are not
natural to the mind of man, but arise from artifice and human conventions_. For
since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys equally
justice and injustice; and since such an alteration has an effect only by
changing our own and the publick interest; it follows, that the first
establishment of the rules of justice depends on these different interests. But
if men pursu'd the publick interest naturally, and with a hearty affection, they
wou'd never have dream'd of restraining each other by these rules; |and if they
pursu'd their own interest, without any precaution, they wou'd run head-long
into every kind of injustice and violence. These rules, therefore, are
artificial, and seek their end in an oblique and indirect manner; nor is the
interest, which gives rise to them, of a kind that cou'd be pursu'd by the
natural and inartificial passions of men.

{#22,pages=497-8} ^To^ make this more evident, consider, that tho' the rules of
justice are establish'd merely by interest, their connexion with interest is
somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observ'd on other
occasions. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to _public interest_;
and were it to stand alone, without being follow'd by other acts, may, in
itself, be very prejudicial to society. When a man of merit, of a beneficent
disposition, restores a great fortune to a miser, or a seditious bigot, he has
acted justly and laudably, but the public is a real sufferer. Nor is every
single act of justice, consider'd apart, more conducive to private interest,
than to public; and 'tis easily conceiv'd how a man may impoverish himself by a
signal instance of integrity, and have reason to wish, that with regard to that
single act, the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe. But
however single acts of justice may be contrary, either to public or private
interest, 'tis certain, that the whole plan or scheme is highly conducive, or
indeed absolutely requisite, both to the support of society, and the well-being
of every individual. 'Tis impossible to separate the good from the ill. Property
must be stable, and must be fix'd by general rules. Tho' in one instance the
public be a sufferer, this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady
prosecution of the rule, and by the peace and order, which it establishes in
society. And even every individual person must find himself a gainer, on
ballancing the account; since, without justice, society must immediately
dissolve, and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which
is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos'd in
society. When therefore men have |had experience enough to observe, that
whatever may be the consequence of any single act of justice, perform'd by a
single person, yet the whole system of actions, concurr'd in by the whole
society, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part; it is not
long before justice and property take place. Every member of society is sensible
of this interest: Every one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the
resolution he has taken of squaring his actions by it, on condition that others
will do the same. No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform an
act of justice, who has the first opportunity. This becomes an example to
others. And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of convention or
agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, suppos'd to be common to all, and
where every single act is perform'd in expectation that others are to perform
the like. Without such a convention, no one wou'd ever have dream'd, that there
was such a virtue as justice, or have been induc'd to conform his actions to it.
Taking any single act, my justice may be pernicious in every respect; and 'tis
only upon the supposition, that others are to imitate my example, that I can be
induc'd to embrace that virtue; since nothing but this combination can render
justice advantageous, or afford me any motives to conform my self to its rules.

{#23,pages=498} We come now to the _second_ question we propos'd, _viz. Why we
annex the idea of virtue to justice, and of vice to injustice_. This question
will not detain us long after the principles, which we have already establish'd.
All we can say of it at present will be dispatch'd in a few words: And for
farther satisfaction, the reader must wait till we come to the _third_ part of
this book. The _natural_ obligation to justice, _viz._ interest, has been fully
explain'd; but as to the _moral_ obligation, or the sentiment of right and
wrong, 'twill first be requisite to examine the natural virtues, before we can
give a full and satisfactory account of it.

{#24,pages=498-500} ^After^ men have found by experience, that their selfishness
|and confin'd generosity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate them for
society; and at the same time have observ'd, that society is necessary to the
satisfaction of those very passions, they are naturally induc'd to lay
themselves under the restraint of such rules, as may render their commerce more
safe and commodious. To the imposition then, and observance of these rules, both
in general, and in every particular instance, they are at first
{~~induc'd->mov'd~~} only by a regard to interest; and this motive, on the first
formation of society, is sufficiently strong and forcible. But when society has
become numerous, and has encreas'd to a tribe or nation, this interest is more
remote; nor do men so readily perceive, that disorder and confusion follow upon
every breach of these rules, as in a more narrow and contracted society. But
tho' in our own actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest, which we
have in maintaining order, and may follow a lesser and more present interest, we
never fail to observe the prejudice we receive, either mediately or immediately,
from the injustice of others; as not being in that case either blinded by
passion, or byass'd by any contrary temptation. Nay when the injustice is so
distant from us, as no way to affect our interest, it still displeases us;
because we consider it as prejudicial to human society, and pernicious to every
one that approaches the person guilty of it. We partake of their uneasiness by
_sympathy_; and as every thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions, upon
the general survey, is call'd Vice, and whatever produces satisfaction, in the
same manner, is denominated Virtue; this is the reason why the sense of moral
good and evil follows upon justice and injustice. And tho' this sense, in the
present case, be deriv'd only from contemplating the actions of others, yet we
fail not to extend it even to our own actions. The _general rule_ reaches beyond
those instances, from which it arose; while at the same time we naturally
_sympathize_ with others in the sentiments they entertain of us. _Thus
self-interest is the original motive to the _establishment_ of justice: but a
_sympathy_ |with public interest is the source of the _moral approbation,_ which
attends that virtue_. {++This latter principle of sympathy is too weak to
controul our passions, but has sufficient force to influence our taste, and give
us the sentiments of approbation or blame.++}

{#25,pages=500} ^Tho^' this progress of the sentiments be _natural_, and even
necessary, 'tis certain, that it is here forwarded by the artifice of
politicians, who, in order to govern men more easily, and preserve peace in
human society, have endeavour'd to produce an esteem for justice, and an
abhorrence of injustice. This, no doubt, must have its effect; but nothing can
be more evident, than that the matter has been carry'd too far by certain
writers on morals, who seem to have employ'd their utmost efforts to extirpate
all sense of virtue from among mankind. Any artifice of politicians may assist
nature in the producing of those sentiments, which she suggests to us, and may
even on some occasions, produce alone an approbation or esteem for any
particular action; but 'tis impossible it should be the sole cause of the
distinction we make betwixt vice and virtue. For if nature did not aid us in
this particular, 'twou'd be in vain for politicians to talk of _honourable_ or
_dishonourable_, _praiseworthy_ or _blameable_. These words wou'd be perfectly
unintelligible, and wou'd no more have any idea annex'd to them, than if they
were of a tongue perfectly unknown to us. The utmost politicians can perform,
is, to extend the natural sentiments beyond their original bounds; but still
nature must furnish the materials, and give us some notion of moral
distinctions.

{#26,pages=500-1} ^As^ publick praise and blame encrease our esteem for justice;
so private education and instruction contribute to the same effect. For as
parents easily observe, that a man is the more useful, both to himself and
others, the greater degree of probity and honour he is endow'd with; and that
those principles have greater force, when custom and education assist interest
and reflection: For these reasons they are induc'd to inculcate on their
children, from their earliest infancy, the principles of probity, and teach them
to regard the observance of those rules, by which society is maintain'd, as
worthy and honourable, and their violation as base and |infamous. By this means
the sentiments of honour may take root in their tender minds, and acquire such
firmness and solidity, that they may fall little short of those principles,
which are the most essential to our natures, and the most deeply radicated in
our internal constitution.

{#27,pages=501} ^What^ farther contributes to encrease their solidity, is the
interest of our reputation, after the opinion, _that a merit or demerit attends
justice or injustice_, is once firmly establish'd among mankind. There is
nothing, which touches us more nearly than our reputation, and nothing on which
our reputation more depends than our conduct, with relation to the property of
others. For this reason, every one, who has any regard to his character, or who
intends to live on good terms with mankind, must fix an inviolable law to
himself, never, by any temptation, to be induc'd to violate those principles,
which are essential to a man of probity and honour.

{#28,pages=501} ^I shall^ make only one observation before I leave this subject,
_viz._ that tho' I assert, that in the _state of nature_, or that imaginary
state, which preceded society, there be neither justice nor injustice, yet I
assert not, that it was allowable, in such a state, to violate the property of
others. I only maintain, that there was no such thing as property; and
consequently cou'd be no such thing as justice or injustice. I shall have
occasion to make a similar reflection with regard to _promises_, when I come to
treat of them; and I hope this reflection, when duly weigh'd, will suffice to
remove all odium from the foregoing opinions, with regard to justice and
injustice.
