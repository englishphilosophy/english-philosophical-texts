{#1,pages=526} WE have now run over the three fundamental laws of nature, _that
of the stability of possession_, _of its transference by consent_, and _of the
performance of promises_. 'Tis on the strict observance of those three laws,
that the peace and security of human society entirely depend; nor is there any
possibility of establishing a good correspondence among men, where these are
neglected. Society is absolutely necessary for the well-being of men; and these
are as necessary to the support of society. Whatever restraint they may impose
on the passions of men, they are the real offspring of those passions, and are
only a more artful and more refin'd way of satisfying them. Nothing is more
vigilant and inventive than our passions; and nothing is more obvious, than the
convention for the observance of these rules. Nature has, therefore, trusted
this affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not plac'd in the mind any
peculiar original principles, to determine us to a set of actions, into which
the other principles of our frame and constitution were sufficient to lead us.
And to convince us the more fully of this truth, we may here stop a moment, and
from a review of the preceding reasonings may draw some new arguments, to prove
that those laws, however necessary, are entirely artificial, and of human
invention; and consequently that justice is an artificial, and not a natural
virtue.

{#2,pages=526-7} I. ^The^ first argument I shall make use of is deriv'd from the
vulgar definition of justice. Justice is commonly defin'd to be _a constant and
perpetual will of giving every one his due_. In this definition 'tis supposed,
that there are such things as right and property, independent of justice, and
antecedent to it; and that they wou'd have subsisted, tho' men had never |dreamt
of practising such a virtue. I have already observ'd, in a cursory manner, the
fallacy of this opinion, and shall here continue to open up a little more
distinctly my sentiments on that subject.

{#3,pages=527} ^I shall^ begin with observing, that this quality, which we call
_property_, is like many of the imaginary qualities of the _peripatetic_
philosophy, and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the subject, when
consider'd a-part from our moral sentiments. 'Tis evident property does not
consist in any of the sensible qualities of the object. For these may continue
invariably the same, while the property changes. Property, therefore, must
consist in some relation of the object. But 'tis not in its relation with regard
to other external and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably
the same, while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the
relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But 'tis not the
external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of property. For that
relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects, or with regard to brute
creatures; tho' in those cases it forms no property. 'Tis, therefore, in some
internal relation, that the property consists; that is, in some influence, which
the external relations of the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the
external relation, which we call _occupation_ or first possession, is not of
itself imagin'd to be the property of the object, but only to cause its
property. Now 'tis evident, this external relation causes nothing in external
objects, and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in
abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor. These
actions are properly what we call _justice_; and consequently 'tis on that
virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue on the property.

{#4,pages=527-8} ^If^ any one, therefore, wou'd assert, that justice is a
natural virtue, and injustice a natural vice, he must assert, that abstracting
from the notions of _property_, and _right_ and _obligation_, a certain conduct
and train of actions, in certain |external relations of objects, has naturally a
moral beauty or deformity, and causes an original pleasure or uneasiness. Thus
the restoring a man's goods to him is consider'd as virtuous, not because nature
has annex'd a certain sentiment of pleasure to such a conduct, with regard to
the property of others, but because she has annex'd that sentiment to such a
conduct, with regard to those external objects, of which others have had the
first or long possession, or which they have receiv'd by the consent of those,
who have had first or long possession. If nature has given us no such sentiment,
there is not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as
property. Now, tho' it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and accurate
consideration of the present subject, that nature has annex'd no pleasure or
sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I may leave as little room
for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few more arguments to confirm my
opinion.

{#5,pages=528} _First_, If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind, it wou'd
have been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion; nor shou'd we
have found any difficulty to perceive, that the consideration of such actions,
in such a situation, gives a certain pleasure and {++a++} sentiment of
approbation. We shou'd not have been oblig'd to have recourse to notions of
property in the definition of justice, and at the same time makeuse of the
notions of justice in the definition of property. This deceitful method of
reasoning is a plain proof, that there are contain'd in the subject some
obscurities and difficulties, which we are not able to surmount, and which we
desire to evade by this artifice.

{#6,pages=528-9} _Secondly_, Those rules, by which {~~properties, rights, and
obligations->property, right, and obligation~~} are determin'd, have in them no
marks of a natural origin, but many of artifice and contrivance. They are too
numerous to have proceeded from nature: They are changeable by human laws: And
have all of them a direct and evident tendency to public good, and the support
of {~~civil society->society~~}. This last circumstance is remarkable upon two
|accounts. _First_, because, tho' the cause of the establishment of these laws
had been a _regard_ for the public good, as much as the public good is their
natural tendency, they wou'd still have been artificial, as being purposely
contriv'd and directed to a certain end. _Secondly_, because, if men had been
endow'd with such a strong regard for public good, they wou'd never have
restrain'd themselves by these rules; so that the laws of justice arise from
natural principles in a manner still more oblique and artificial. 'Tis self-love
which is their real origin; and as the self-love of one person is naturally
contrary to that of another, these several interested passions are oblig'd to
adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and
behaviour. This system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each
individual, is of course advantageous to the public; tho' it be not intended for
that purpose by the inventors.//

{#7,pages=529-30} II. ^In^ the second place we may observe, that all kinds of
vice and virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such
imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely
impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and from this
observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing principle. For
whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue, 'tis
certain, that rights, and obligations, and property, admit of no such insensible
gradation, but that a man either has a full and perfect property, or none at
all; and is either entirely oblig'd to perform any action, or lies under no
manner of obligation. However civil laws may talk of a perfect _dominion_, and
of an imperfect, 'tis easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which
has no foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural
justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, tho' but for a day, has as full a
right to make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its proprietor has to
make use of it any other day; and 'tis evident, that however the use may be
|bounded in time or degree, the right itself is not susceptible of any such
gradation, but is absolute and entire, so far as it extends. Accordingly we may
observe, that this right both arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man
entirely acquires the property of any object by occupation, or the consent of
the proprietor; and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible
gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations. Since,
therefore, this is the case with regard to property, and rights, and
obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and injustice? After
whatever manner you answer this question, you run into inextricable
difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice admit of degree, and run
insensibly into each other, you expressly contradict the foregoing position,
that obligation and property are not susceptible of such a gradation. These
depend entirely upon justice and injustice, and follow them in all their
variations. Where the justice is entire, the property is also entire: Where the
justice is imperfect, the property must also be imperfect. And _vice versa_, if
the property admit of no such variations, they must also be incompatible with
justice. If you assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that
justice and injustice are not susceptible of degrees, you in effect assert, that
they are not _naturally_ either vicious or virtuous; since vice and virtue,
moral good and evil, and indeed all _natural_ qualities, run insensibly into
each other, and are, on many occasions, undistinguishable.

{#8,pages=530-1} ^And^ here it may be worth while to observe, that tho' abstract
reasoning, and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this position,
_that property, and right, and obligation admit not of degrees_, yet in our
common and negligent way of thinking, we find great difficulty to entertain that
opinion, and do even _secretly_ embrace the contrary principle. An object must
either be in the possession of one person or another. An action must either be
perform'd or not. The necessity there is of choosing one side in these
|dilemmas, and the impossibility there often is of finding any just medium,
oblige us, when we reflect on the matter, to acknowledge, that all property and
obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we consider the origin of
property and obligation, and find that they depend on public utility, and
sometimes on the {~~propensity->propensities~~} of the imagination, which are
seldom entire on any side; we are naturally inclin'd to imagine, that these
moral relations admit of an insensible gradation. Hence it is, that in
references, where the consent of the parties leave the referees entire masters
of the subject, they commonly discover so much equity and justice on both sides,
as induces them to strike a medium, and divide the difference betwixt the
parties. Civil judges, who have not this liberty, but are oblig'd to give a
decisive sentence on some one side, are often at a loss how to determine, and
are necessitated to proceed on the most frivolous reasons in the world. Half
rights and obligations, which seem so natural in common life, are perfect
absurdities in their tribunal; for which reason they are often oblig'd to take
half arguments for whole ones, in order to terminate the affair one way or
other.//

{#9,pages=531-3} III. ^The^ third argument of this kind I shall make use of may
be explain'd thus. If we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall
find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules; but
acts on most occasions as it is determin'd by its present motives and
inclination. As each action is a particular individual event, it must proceed
from particular principles, and from our immediate situation within ourselves,
and with respect to the rest of the universe. If on some occasions we extend our
motives beyond those very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form
something like _general rules_ for our conduct, 'tis easy to observe, that these
rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since,
therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may conclude, |that
the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be
deriv'd from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or
inclination. No action can be either morally good or evil, unless there be some
natural passion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and 'tis
evident, that the morality must be susceptible of all the same variations, which
are natural to the passion. Here are two persons, who dispute for an estate; of
whom one is rich, a fool, and a batchelor; the other poor, a man of sense, and
has a numerous family: The first is my enemy; the second my friend. Whether I be
actuated in this affair by a view to public or private interest, by friendship
or enmity, I must be induc'd to do my utmost to procure the estate to the
latter. Nor wou'd any consideration of the right and property of the persons be
able to restrain me, were I actuated only by natural motives, without any
combination or convention with others. For as all property depends on morality;
and as all morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions;
and as these again are only directed by particular motives; 'tis evident, such a
partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality, and cou'd never be a
violation of property. Were men, therefore, to take the liberty of acting with
regard to the laws of society, as they do in every other affair, they wou'd
conduct themselves, on most occasions, by particular judgments, and wou'd take
into consideration the characters and circumstances of the persons, as well as
the general nature of the question. But 'tis easy to observe, that this wou'd
produce an infinite confusion in human society, and that the avidity and
partiality of men wou'd quickly bring disorder into the world, if not restrain'd
by some general and inflexible principles. 'Twas, therefore, with a view to this
inconvenience, that men have establish'd those principles, and have agreed to
restrain themselves by general rules, which are unchangeable by spite and
favour, and by particular views of private or public interest. These rules,
then, are artificially invented for a certain |purpose, and are contrary to the
common principles of human nature, which accommodate themselves to
circumstances, and have no stated invariable method of operation.

{#10,pages=533} ^Nor^ do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter.
I see evidently, that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible rules
in his conduct with others, he considers certain objects as their property,
which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable. But no proposition can be more
evident, than that property is perfectly unintelligible without first supposing
justice and injustice; and that these {~~virtues and vices->moral duties~~} are
as unintelligible, unless we have motives, independent of the morality, to impel
us to just actions, and deter us from unjust ones. Let those motives, therefore,
be what they will, they must accommodate themselves to circumstances, and must
admit of all the variations, which human affairs, in their incessant
revolutions, are susceptible of. They are consequently a very improper
foundation for such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of nature; and 'tis
evident these laws can only be deriv'd from human conventions, when men have
perceiv'd the disorders that result from following their natural and variable
principles.

{#11,pages=533-4} ^Upon^ the whole, then, we are to consider this distinction
betwixt justice and injustice, as having two different foundations, _viz._ that
of {~~interest->_self-interest_~~}, when men observe, that 'tis impossible to
live in society without restraining themselves by certain rules; and that of
_morality_, when this interest is once {~~observ'd,->observ'd to be common to
all mankind,~~} and men receive a pleasure from the view of such actions as tend
to the peace of society, and an uneasiness from such as are contrary to it. 'Tis
the voluntary convention and artifice of men, which makes the first interest
take place; and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be consider'd as
_artificial_. After that interest is once establish'd and acknowledg'd, the
sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows _naturally_, and of
itself; tho' 'tis certain, that it is also augmented by a new _artifice_, and
that the public instructions |of politicians, and the private education of
parents, contribute to the giving {++us++} a sense of honour and duty in the
strict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others.
