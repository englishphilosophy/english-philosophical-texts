£4 _Of the obligation of promises._ £4

{#1,pages=516} THAT the rule of morality, which enjoins the performance of
promises, is not _natural_, will sufficiently appear from these two
propositions, which I proceed to prove, viz. _that a promise wou'd not be
intelligible, before human conventions had establish'd it_; and _that even if it
were intelligible, it wou'd not be attended with any moral obligation_.

{#2,pages=516} ^I say^, _first_, that a promise is not intelligible naturally,
nor antecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with society,
could never enter into any engagements with another, even tho' they could
perceive each other's thoughts by intuition. If promises be natural and
intelligible, there must be some act of the mind attending these words, _I
promise_; and on this act of the mind must the obligation depend. Let us,
therefore, run over all the faculties of the soul, and see which of them is
exerted in our promises.

{#3,pages=516-7} ^The^ act of the mind, exprest by a promise, is not a
_resolution_ to perform any thing: For that alone never imposes any obligation.
Nor is it a _desire_ of such a performance: For we may bind ourselves without
such a desire, or even with an aversion, declar'd and avow'd. Neither is it the
_willing_ of that action, which we promise to perform: For a promise always
regards some future time, and the will has an influence only on present actions.
It follows, therefore, that since the act of the mind, which enters into a
promise, and produces its obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor
willing any particular performance, it must necessarily be the _willing_ of
that_obligation_, which arises from the promise. Nor is this |only a conclusion
of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of
expressing ourselves, when we say that we are bound by our own consent, and that
the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure. The only question, then,
is, whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind,
and such an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into, whose ideas are not confounded
{~~with->by~~} prejudice and the fallacious use of language.

{#4,pages=517} ^All^ morality depends upon our sentiments; and when any action,
or quality of the mind, pleases us _after a certain manner_, we say it is
virtuous; and when the neglect, or non-performance of it, displeases us _after a
like manner_, we say that we lie under an obligation to perform it. A change of
the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment; and a creation of a new
obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise. But 'tis certain we can
naturally no more change our own sentiments, than the motions of the heavens;
nor by a single act of our will, that is, by a promise, render any action
agreeable or disagreeable, moral or immoral; which, without that act, wou'd have
produc'd contrary impressions, or have been endow'd with different qualities. It
wou'd be absurd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new
sentiment of pain or pleasure; nor is it possible, that men cou'd naturally fall
into so gross an absurdity. A promise, therefore, is _naturally_ something
altogether unintelligible, nor is there any act of the mind belonging to
it[n77].

{#5,pages=518} ^But^, _secondly_, if there was any act of the mind belonging to
it, it could not _naturally_ produce any obligation. This appears evidently from
the foregoing reasoning. A promise creates a new obligation. A new obligation
supposes new sentiments to arise. The will never creates new sentiments. There
could not naturally, therefore, arise any obligation from a promise, even
supposing the mind could fall into the absurdity of willing that obligation.

{#6,pages=518-9} ^The^ same truth may be prov'd still more evidently by that
reasoning, which prov'd justice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action
can be requir'd of us as our duty, unless there be implanted in human nature
some actuating passion or motive, capable of producing the action. This motive
cannot be the sense of duty. A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obligation:
And where an action is not requir'd by any natural passion, it cannot be
requir'd by any natural obligation; since it may be omitted without proving any
defect or imperfection in the mind and temper, and consequently without any
vice. Now 'tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of
promises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises had no
moral obligation, we never shou'd feel any inclination to observe them. This is
not the case with the natural virtues. Tho' there was no obligation to relieve
the miserable, our humanity wou'd lead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the
immorality of the omission arises from its being a proof, that we want the
natural sentiments of humanity. A father knows it to be his duty to take care of
his children: But he |has also a natural inclination to it. And if no human
creature had that inclination, no one cou'd lie under any such obligation. But
as there is naturally no inclination to observe promises, distinct from a sense
of their obligation; it follows, that fidelity is no natural virtue, and that
promises have no force, antecedent to human conventions.

{#7,pages=519} ^If^ any one dissent from this, he must give a regular proof of
these two propositions, viz. _that there is a peculiar act of the mind, annext
to promises_; and _that consequent to this act of the mind, there arises an
inclination to perform, distinct from a sense of duty_. I presume, that it is
impossible to prove either of these two points; and therefore I venture to
conclude, that promises are human inventions, founded on the necessities and
interests of society.

{#8,pages=519-21} ^In^ order to discover these necessities and interests, we
must consider the same qualities of human nature, which we have already found to
give rise to the preceding laws of society. Men being naturally selfish, or
endow'd only with a confin'd generosity, they are not easily induc'd to perform
any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to some reciprocal
advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by such a performance. Now as
it frequently happens, that these mutual performances cannot be finish'd at the
same instant, 'tis necessary, that one party be contented to remain in
uncertainty, and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a return of
kindness. But so much corruption is there among men, that, generally speaking,
this becomes but a slender security; and as the benefactor is here suppos'd to
bestow his favours with a view to self-interest, this both takes off from the
obligation, and sets an example of selfishness, which is the true mother of
ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural course of our passions
and inclinations, we shou'd perform but few actions for the advantage of others,
from disinterested views; because we are naturally very limited in our kindness
and affection: And we shou'd perform as few of that kind, out of |a regard to
interest; because we cannot depend upon their gratitude. Here then is the mutual
commerce of good offices in a manner lost among mankind, and every one reduc'd
to his own skill and industry for his well-being and subsistence. The invention
of the law of nature, concerning the _stability_ of possession, has already
render'd men tolerable to each other; that of the _transference_ of property and
possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous: But still
these {~~laws of nature->laws~~}, however strictly observ'd, are not sufficient
to render them so serviceable to each other, as by nature they are fitted to
become. Tho' possession be _stable_, men may often reap but small advantage from
it, while they are possess'd of a greater quantity of any species of goods than
they have occasion for, and at the same time suffer by the want of others. The
_transference_ of property, which is the proper remedy for this inconvenience,
cannot remedy it entirely; because it can only take place with regard to such
objects as are _present_ and _individual_, but not to such as are _absent_ or
_general_. One cannot transfer the property of a particular house, twenty
leagues distant; because the consent cannot be attended with delivery, which is
a requisite circumstance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten bushels
of corn, or five hogsheads of wine, by the mere expression and consent; because
these are only general terms, and have no direct relation to any particular heap
of corn, or barrels of wine. Besides, the commerce of mankind is not confin'd to
the barter of commodities, but may extend to services and actions, which we may
exchange to our mutual interest and advantage. Your corn is ripe to-day; mine
will be so to-morrow. 'Tis profitable for us both, that I shou'd labour with you
to-day, and that you shou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and
know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your
account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a
return, I know I shou'd be disappointed, and that I shou'd in vain depend upon
|your gratitude. Here then I leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same
manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual
confidence and security.

{#9,pages=521} ^All^ this is the effect of the natural and inherent principles
and passions of human nature; and as these passions and principles are
inalterable, it may be thought, that our conduct, which depends on them, must be
so too, and that 'twou'd be in vain, either for moralists or politicians, to
tamper with us, or attempt to change the usual course of our actions, with a
view to public interest. And indeed, did the success of their designs depend
upon their success in correcting the selfishness and ingratitude of men, they
wou'd never make any progress, unless aided by omnipotence, which is alone able
to new-mould the human mind, and change its character in such fundamental
articles. All they can pretend to, is, to give a new direction to those natural
passions, and teach us that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique
and artificial manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I
learn to do a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness; because
I forsee, that he will return my service, in expectation of another of the same
kind, and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good offices with me
or with others. And accordingly, after I have serv'd him, and he is in
possession of the advantage arising from my action, he is induc'd to perform his
part, as foreseeing the consequences of his refusal.

{#10,pages=521-2} ^But^ tho' this self-interested commerce of men begins to take
place, and to predominate in society, it does not entirely abolish the more
generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices. I may still do
services to such persons as I love, and am more particularly acquainted with,
without any prospect of advantage; and they may make me a return in the same
manner, without any view but that of recompensing my past services. In order,
therefore, to distinguish those two different sorts of commerce, the interested
and the dis|interested, there is a _certain form of words_ invented for the
former, by which we bind ourselves to the performance of any action. This form
of words constitutes what we call a _promise_, which is the sanction of the
interested commerce of mankind. When a man says _he promises any thing_, he in
effect expresses a _resolution_ of performing it; and along with that, by making
use of this _form of words_, subjects himself to the penalty of never being
trusted again in case of failure. A resolution is the natural act of the mind,
which promises express: But were there no more than a resolution in the case,
promises wou'd only declare our former motives, and wou'd not create any new
motive or obligation. They are the conventions of men, which create a new
motive, when experience has taught us, that human affairs wou'd be conducted
much more for mutual advantage, were there certain _symbols_ or _signs_
instituted, by which we might give each other security of our conduct in any
particular incident. After these signs are instituted, whoever uses them is
immediately bound by his interest to execute his engagements, and must never
expect to be trusted any more, if he refuse to perform what he promis'd.

{#11,pages=522-3} ^Nor^ is that knowledge, which is requisite to make mankind
sensible of this interest in the _institution_ and _observance_ of promises, to
be esteem'd superior to the capacity of human nature, however savage and
uncultivated. There needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us
perceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest experience of
society discovers them to every mortal; and when each individual perceives the
same sense of interest in all his fellows, he immediately performs his part of
any contract, as being assur'd, that they will not be wanting in theirs. All of
them, by concert, enter into a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit,
and agree to be true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form
this concert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in the
faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to other |members of
the society. This immediately causes that interest to operate upon them; and
interest is the _first_ obligation to the performance of promises.

{#12,pages=523} ^Afterwards^ a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and
becomes a new obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the
performance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in the
abstinence from the property of others. _Public interest_, _education_, and _the
artifices of politicians_, have the same effect in both cases. The difficulties,
that occur to us, in supposing a moral obligation to attend promises, we either
surmount or elude. For instance; the expression of a resolution is not commonly
suppos'd to be obligatory; and we cannot readily conceive how the making use of
a certain form of words shou'd be able to cause any material difference. Here,
therefore, we _feign_ a new act of the mind, which we call the _willing_ an
obligation; and on this we suppose the morality to depend. But we have prov'd
already, that there is no such act of the mind, and consequently that promises
impose no natural obligation.

{#13,pages=523-4} ^To^ confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections
concerning that will, which is suppos'd to enter into a promise, and to cause
its obligation. 'Tis evident, that the will alone is never suppos'd to cause the
obligation, but must be express'd by words or signs, in order to impose a tye
upon any man. The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will,
soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by
his word, tho' he secretly give a different direction to his intention, and
with-hold himself both from a resolution, and from willing an obligation. But
tho' the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise, yet it
does not always so; and one, who shou'd make use of any expression, of which he
knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any intention of binding
himself, wou'd not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he knows its meaning, yet
if he uses it in jest only, and |with such signs as shew evidently he has no
serious intention of binding himself, he wou'd not lie under any obligation of
performance; but 'tis necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the
will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to
imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from
certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his
expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion
to those cases, where the signs are of a different kind from those of deceit.
All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if the obligation of promises
be merely a human invention for the convenience of society; but will never be
explain'd, if it be something _real_ and _natural_, arising from any action of
the mind or body.

{#14,pages=524-5} ^I shall^ farther observe, that since every new promise
imposes a new obligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this
new obligation arises from his will; 'tis one of the most mysterious and
incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagin'd, and may even be
compar'd to  _transubstantiation_, or _holy orders_[n78], where a certain form
of words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an
external object, and even of a human creature. But tho' these mysteries be so
far alike, 'tis very remarkable, that they differ widely in other particulars,
and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof of the difference of
their origins. As the obligation of promises is an invention for the interest of
society, 'tis warp'd into as many different forms as that interest requires, and
even runs into direct contradictions, rather than lose sight of its object. But
as those other monstrous doctrines are mere priestly inventions, and have no
public interest in view, they are less disturb'd in their progress by new
obstacles; and it must be own'd, that, after the first absurdity, |they follow
more directly the current of reason and good sense. Theologians clearly
perceiv'd, that the external form of words, being mere sound, require an
intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this intention being once
consider'd as a requisite circumstance, its absence must equally prevent the
effect, whether avow'd or conceal'd, whether sincere or deceitful. Accordingly
they have commonly determin'd, that the intention of the priest makes the
sacrament, and that when he secretly withdraws his intention, he is highly
criminal in himself; but still destroys the baptism, or communion, or holy
orders. The terrible consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its
taking place; as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine, with regard to
promises, have prevented that doctrine from establishing itself. Men are always
more concern'd about the present life than the future; and are apt to think the
smallest evil, which regards the former, more important than the greatest, which
regards the latter.

{#15,pages=525} ^We^ may draw the same conclusion, concerning the origin of
promises, from the _force_, which is suppos'd to invalidate all contracts, and
to free us from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promises
have no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the
convenience and advantage of society. If we consider aright of the matter, force
is not essentially different from any other motive of hope or fear, which may
induce us to engage our word, and lay ourselves under any obligation. A man,
dangerously wounded, who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him,
wou'd certainly be bound to performance; tho' the case be not so much different
from that of one, who promises a sum to a robber, as to produce so great a
difference in our sentiments of morality, if these sentiments were not built
entirely on public interest and convenience.

{#n77,pages=517-8} Were morality discoverable by reason, and not by sentiment,
'twou'd be still more evident, that promises cou'd make no alteration upon it.
Morality is suppos'd to consist in relation. Every new imposition of morality,
therefore, must arise from some new relation of objects; and consequently the
will cou'd not produce _immediately_ any change in morals, but cou'd have that
effect only by producing a change upon the objects. But as the moral obligation
of a promise is the pure effect of the will, without the least change in any
part of the universe; it follows, that promises have no _natural_ obligation. //
~~Shou'd it be said, that this act of the will being in effect a new object,
produces new relations and new duties; I wou'd answer, that this is a pure
sophism, which may be detected by a very moderate share of accuracy and
exactness. To will a new |obligation, is to will a new relation of objects; and
therefore, if this new relation of objects were form'd by the volition itself,
we shou'd in effect will the volition; which is plainly absurd and impossible.
The will has here no object to which it cou'd tend; but must return upon itself
_in infinitum_. The new obligation depends upon new relations. The new relations
depend upon a new volition. The new volition has for object a new obligation,
and consequently new relations, and consequently a new volition; which volition
again has in view a new obligation, relation and volition, without any
termination. 'Tis impossible, therefore, we cou'd ever will a new obligation;
and consequently 'tis impossible the will cou'd ever accompany a promise, or
produce a new obligation of morality.

{#n78,pages=524} I mean so far, as holy orders are suppos'd to produce the
_indelible character_. In other respects they are only a legal qualification.
