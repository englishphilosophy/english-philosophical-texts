{#1,pages=553-4} BUT tho', on some occasions, it may be justifiable, both in
sound politics and morality, to resist supreme power, 'tis certain, that in the
ordinary course of human affairs nothing can be more pernicious and criminal;
and that besides the convulsions, which always attend revolutions, such a
practice tends directly to the subversion of all government, and the causing an
universal anarchy and confusion among mankind. As numerous and civiliz'd
societies cannot subsist |without government, so government is entirely useless
without an exact obedience. We ought always to weigh the advantages, which we
reap from authority, against the disadvantages; and by this means we shall
become more scrupulous of putting in practice the doctrine of resistance. The
common rule requires submission; and 'tis only in cases of grievous tyranny and
oppression, that the exception can take place.

{#2,pages=554} ^Since^ then such a blind submission is commonly due to
magistracy, the next question is, _to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard
as our lawful magistrates?_ In order to answer this question, let us recollect
what we have already establish'd concerning the origin of government and
political society. When men have once experienc'd the impossibility of
preserving any steady order in society, while every one is his own master, and
violates or observes the laws of {~~interest->society~~}, according to his
present interest or pleasure, they naturally run into the invention of
government, and put it out of their own power, as far as possible, to transgress
the {~~laws->rules~~} of society. Government, therefore, arises from the
voluntary convention of men; and 'tis evident, that the same convention, which
establishes government, will also determine the persons who are to govern, and
will remove all doubt and ambiguity in this particular. And the voluntary
consent of men must here have the greater efficacy, that the authority of the
magistrate does _at first_ stand upon the foundation of a promise of the
subjects, by which they bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract
or engagement. The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them
down to a particular person, and makes him the object of their allegiance.

{#3,pages=554-6} ^But^ when government has been establish'd on this footing for
some considerable time, and the separate interest, which we have in submission,
has produc'd a separate sentiment of morality, the case is entirely alter'd, and
a promise is no longer able to determine the particular magistrate; since it |is
no longer consider'd as the foundation of government. We naturally suppose
ourselves born to submission; and imagine, that such particular persons have a
right to command, as we on our part are bound to obey. These notions of right
and obligation are deriv'd from nothing but the _advantage_ {~~we reap->reapt~~}
from government, which gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves,
and makes us displeas'd with any instance of it in others. But here 'tis
remarkable, that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of
government, which is _interest_, is not admitted to determine the persons, whom
we are to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on the
footing of a _promise_. A _promise_ fixes and determines the persons, without
any uncertainty: But 'tis evident, that if men were to regulate their conduct in
this particular, by the view of a peculiar _interest_, either public or private,
they wou'd involve themselves in endless confusion, and wou'd render all
government, in a great measure, ineffectual. The private interest of every one
is different; and tho' the public interest in itself be always one and the same,
yet it becomes the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different
opinions of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore,
which causes us to submit to magistracy, makes us renounce itself in the choice
of our magistrates, and binds us down to a certain form of government, and to
particular persons, without allowing us to aspire to the utmost perfection in
either. The case is here the same as in that law of nature concerning the
stability of possession. 'Tis highly advantageous, and even absolutely necessary
to society, that possession shou'd be stable; and this leads us to the
establishment of such a rule: But we find, that were we to follow the same
advantage, in assigning particular possessions to particular persons, we shou'd
disappoint our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to
prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate ourselves by
general interests, in modifying the law of nature concerning the |stability of
possession. Nor need we fear, that our attachment to this law will diminish upon
account of the seeming frivolousness of those interests, by which it is
determin'd. The impulse of the mind is deriv'd from a very strong interest; and
those other more minute interests serve only to direct the motion, without
adding any thing to it, or diminishing from it. 'Tis the same case with
government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an invention; and
this interest is sufficient to make us embrace it with ardour and alacrity; tho'
we are oblig'd afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by
several considerations, which are not of the same importance, and to chuse our
magistrates without having in view any particular advantage from the choice.

{#4,pages=556} ^The^ _first_ of those principles I shall take notice of, as a
foundation of the right of magistracy, is that which gives authority to {~~all
the most establish'd governments of the world without exception->almost all the
establish'd governments of the world~~}: I mean, _long possession_ in any one
form of government, or succession of princes. 'Tis certain, that if we remount
to the first origin of every nation, we shall find, that there scarce is any
race of kings, or form of a commonwealth, that is not primarily founded on
usurpation and rebellion, and whose title is not at first worse than doubtful
and uncertain. Time alone gives solidity to their right; and operating gradually
on the minds of men, reconciles them to any authority, and makes it seem just
and reasonable. Nothing causes any sentiment to have a greater influence upon us
than custom, or turns our imagination more strongly to any object. When we have
been long accustom'd to obey any set of men, that general instinct or tendency,
which we have to suppose a moral obligation attending loyalty, takes easily this
direction, and chuses that set of men for its objects. 'Tis interest which gives
the general instinct; but 'tis custom which gives the particular direction.

{#5,pages=556-7} ^And^ here 'tis observable, that the same length of time has a
different influence on our sentiments of morality, according |to its different
influence on the mind. We naturally judge of every thing by comparison; and
since in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics, we embrace a long
extent of time, a small duration has not in this case a like influence on our
sentiments, as when we consider any other object. One thinks he acquires a right
to a horse, or a suit of cloaths, in a very short time; but a century is scarce
sufficient to establish any new government, or remove all scruples in the minds
of the subjects concerning it. Add to this, that a shorter period of time will
suffice to give a prince a title to any additional power he may usurp, than will
serve to fix his right, where the whole is an usurpation. The kings of _France_
have not been possess'd of absolute power for above two reigns; and yet nothing
will appear more extravagant to _Frenchmen_ than to talk of their liberties. If
we consider what has been said concerning _accession_, we shall easily account
for this ph{ae}nomenon.

{#6,pages=557} ^When^ there is no form of government establish'd by _long_
possession, the _present_ possession is sufficient to supply its place, and may
be regarded as the _second_ source of all public authority. Right to authority
is nothing but the constant possession of authority, maintain'd by the laws of
society and the interests of mankind; and nothing can be more natural than to
join this constant possession to the present one, according to the principles
above-mention'd. If the same principles did not take place with regard to the
property of private persons, 'twas because these principles were
counter-ballanc'd by very strong considerations of interest; when we observ'd,
that all restitution wou'd by that means be prevented, and every violence be
authoriz'd and protected. And tho' the same motives may seem to have force, with
regard to public authority, yet they are oppos'd by a contrary interest; which
consists in the preservation of peace, and the avoiding of all changes, which,
however they may be easily produc'd in private affairs, are unavoidably attended
with bloodshed and confusion, where the public is interested.

{#7,pages=558} ^Any^ one, who finding the impossibility of accounting for the
right of the present possessor, by any receiv'd system of ethics, shou'd resolve
to deny absolutely that right, and assert, that it is not authoriz'd by
morality, wou'd be justly thought to maintain a very extravagant paradox, and to
shock the common sense and judgment of mankind. No maxim is more conformable,
both to prudence and morals, than to submit quietly to the government, which we
find establish'd in the country where we happen to live, without enquiring too
curiously into its origin and first establishment. Few governments will bear
being examin'd so rigorously. How many kingdoms are there at present in the
world, and how many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better
foundation for their authority than that of present possession? To confine
ourselves to the _Roman_ and _Grecian_ empire; is it not evident, that the long
succession of emperors, from the dissolution of the _Roman_ liberty, to the
final extinction of that empire by the _Turks_, cou'd not so much as pretend to
any other title to the empire? The election of the senate was a mere form, which
always follow'd the choice of the legions; and these were almost always divided
in the different provinces, and nothing but the sword was able to terminate the
difference. 'Twas by the sword, therefore, that every emperor acquir'd, as well
as defended his right; and we must either say, that all the known world, for so
many ages, had no government, and ow'd no allegiance to any one, or must allow,
that the right of the stronger, in public affairs, is to be receiv'd as
legitimate, and authoriz'd by morality, when not oppos'd by any other title.

{#8,pages=558-9} ^The^ right of _conquest_ may be consider'd as a _third_ source
of the title of sovereigns. This right resembles very much that of present
possession; but has rather a superior force, being seconded by the notions of
glory and honour, which we ascribe to _conquerors_, instead of the sentiments of
hatred and detestation, which attend _usurpers_. Men naturally favour those they
love; and therefore are more apt to ascribe a |right to successful violence,
betwixt one sovereign and another, than to the successful rebellion of a subject
against his sovereign[n81].

{#9,pages=559} ^When^ neither long possession, nor present possession, nor
conquest take place, as when the first sovereign, who founded any monarchy,
dies; in that case, the right of _succession_ naturally prevails in their stead,
and men are commonly induc'd to place the son of their late monarch on the
throne, and suppose him to inherit his father's authority. The presum'd consent
of the father, the imitation of the succession to private families, the interest
which the state has in chusing the person, who is most powerful, and has the
most numerous followers; all these reasons lead men to prefer the son of their
late monarch to any other person[n82].

{#10,pages=559} ^These^ reasons have some weight; but I am persuaded, that to
one, who considers impartially of the matter, 'twill appear, that {~~there
concur some principles of the imagination, along->some principles of the
imagination concur~~} with those views of {++justice and++} interest. The royal
authority seems to be connected with the young prince even in his father's
life-time, by the natural transition of the thought; and still more after his
death: So that nothing is more natural than to compleat this union by a new
relation, and by putting him actually in possession of what seems so naturally
to belong to him.

{#11,pages=559-60} ^To^ confirm this we may weigh the following ph{ae}nomena,
which are pretty curious in their kind. In elective monarchies the right of
succession has no place by the laws and settled custom; and yet its influence is
so natural, that 'tis impossible |entirely to exclude it from the imagination,
and render the subjects indifferent to the son of their deceas'd monarch. Hence
in some governments of this kind, the choice commonly falls on one or other of
the royal family; and in some governments they are all excluded. Those contrary
ph{ae}nomena proceed from the same principle. Where the royal family is
excluded, 'tis from a refinement in politics, which makes people sensible of
their propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family, and gives them a jealousy
of their liberty, lest their new monarch, aided by this propensity, shou'd
establish his family, and destroy the freedom of elections for the future.

{#12,pages=560} ^The^ history of _Artaxerxes_, and the younger _Cyrus_, may
furnish us with some reflections to the same purpose. _Cyrus_ pretended a right
to the throne above his elder brother, because he was born after his father's
accession. I do not pretend, that this reason was valid. I wou'd only infer from
it, that he wou'd never have made use of such a pretext, were it not for the
qualities of the imagination above-mention'd, by which we are naturally inclin'd
to unite by a new relation whatever objects we find already united. _Artaxerxes_
had an advantage above his brother, as being the eldest son, and the first in
succession: But _Cyrus_ was more closely related to the royal authority, as
being begot after his father was invested with it.

{#13,pages=560-1} ^Shou^'^d^ it here be pretended, that the view of convenience
may be the source of all the right of succession, and that men gladly take
advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the successor of their late
sovereign, and prevent that anarchy and confusion, which attends all new
elections: To this I wou'd answer, {~~that I readily allow, that this motive may
contribute something->that perhaps this motive may contribute somewhat~~} to the
effect; {~~but at the same time I assert, that->but that~~} without another
principle, 'tis impossible such a motive shou'd take place. The interest of a
nation requires, that the succession to the crown shou'd be fix'd one way or
other; but 'tis the same thing to its interest in what way it be fix'd: So that
if the relation of blood had not |an effect independent of public interest, it
wou'd never have been regarded, without a positive law; and 'twou'd have been
impossible, that so many positive laws of different nations cou'd ever have
concur'd precisely in the same views and intentions.

{#14,pages=561-2} ^This^ leads us to consider the _fifth_ source of authority,
viz. _positive laws_; when the legislature establishes a certain form of
government and succession of princes. At first sight it may be thought, that
this must resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority. The
legislative power, whence the positive law is deriv'd, must either be
establish'd by original contract, long possession, present possession, conquest,
or succession; and consequently the positive law must derive its force from some
of those principles. But here 'tis remarkable, that tho' a positive law can only
derive its force from these principles, yet it acquires not all the force of the
principle from whence it is deriv'd, but loses considerably in the transition;
as it is natural to imagine. For instance; a government is establish'd for many
centuries on a certain system of laws, forms, and methods of succession. The
legislative power, establish'd by this long succession, changes all on a sudden
the whole system of government, and introduces a new constitution in its stead.
I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound to comply with this
alteration, unless it have an evident tendency to the public good: But will
think themselves still at liberty to return to the antient government. Hence the
notion of _fundamental laws_; which are suppos'd to be inalterable by the will
of the sovereign: And of this nature the _Salic_ law is understood to be in
_France_. How far these fundamental laws extend is not determin'd in any
government; nor is it possible it ever shou'd. There is such an insensible
gradation from the most material laws to the most trivial, and from the most
antient laws to the most modern, that 'twill be impossible to set bounds to the
legislative power, and determine how far it may innovate in the principles of
government. |That is the work more of imagination and passion than of reason.

{#15,pages=562-3} ^Whoever^ considers the history of the several nations of the
world; their revolutions, conquests, increase, and diminution; the manner in
which their particular governments are establish'd, and the successive right
transmitted from one person to another, will soon learn to treat very lightly
all disputes concerning the rights of princes, and will be convinc'd, that a
strict adherence to any general rules, and the rigid loyalty to particular
persons and families, on which some people set so high a value, are virtues that
hold less of reason, than of bigotry and superstition. In this particular, the
study of history confirms the reasonings of true philosophy; which, shewing us
the original qualities of human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies
in politics as incapable of any decision in most cases, and as entirely
subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty. Where the public good does
not evidently demand a change; 'tis certain, that the concurrence of all those
titles, _original contract_, _long possession_, _present possession_,
_succession_, and _positive laws_, forms the strongest title to sovereignty, and
is justly regarded as sacred and inviolable. But when these titles are mingled
and oppos'd in different degrees, they often occasion perplexity; and are less
capable of solution from the arguments of lawyers and philosophers, than from
the swords of the soldiery. Who shall tell me, for instance, whether
_Germanicus_, or _Drusus_, ought to have succeeded _Tiberius_, had he died while
they were both alive, without naming any of them for his successor? Ought the
right of adoption to be receiv'd as equivalent to that of blood in a nation,
where it had the same effect in private families, and had already, in two
instances, taken place in the public? Ought _Germanicus_ to be esteem'd the
eldest son, because he was born before _Drusus_; or the younger, because he was
adopted after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of the elder to be
regarded in a nation, where the eldest brother had no advantage in the
|succession to private families? Ought the _Roman_ empire at that time to be
esteem'd hereditary, because of two examples; or ought it, even so early, to be
regarded as belonging to the stronger, or the present possessor, as being
founded on so recent an usurpation? Upon whatever principles we may pretend to
answer these and such like questions, I am afraid we shall never be able to
satisfy an impartial enquirer, who adopts no party in political controversies,
and will be satisfied with nothing but sound reason and philosophy.//

{#16,pages=563-4} ^But^ here an _English_ reader will be apt to enquire
concerning that famous _revolution_, which has had such a happy influence on our
constitution, and has been attended with such mighty consequences. We have
already remark'd, that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression, 'tis
lawful to take arms even against supreme power; and that as government is a mere
human invention for mutual advantage and security, it no longer imposes any
obligation, either natural or moral, when once it ceases to have that tendency.
But tho' this _general_ principle be authoriz'd by common sense, and the
practice of all ages, 'tis certainly impossible for the laws, or even for
philosophy, to establish any _particular_ rules, by which we may know when
resistance is lawful; and decide all controversies, which may arise on that
subject. This may not only happen with regard to supreme power; but 'tis
possible, even in some constitutions, where the legislative authority is not
lodg'd in one person, that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful, as
to oblige the laws to keep silence in this particular. Nor wou'd this silence be
an effect only of their _respect_, but also of their _prudence_; since 'tis
certain, that in the vast variety of circumstances, which occur in all
governments, {~~an->a particular~~} exercise of power, in so great a magistrate,
may at one time be beneficial to the public, which at another time wou'd be
pernicious and tyrannical. But notwithstanding this silence of the laws in
limited monarchies, 'tis certain, that the people still retain the |right of
resistance; since 'tis impossible, even in the most despotic governments, to
deprive them of it. The same necessity of self-preservation, and the same motive
of public good, give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other. And
we may farther observe, that in such mix'd governments, the cases, wherein
resistance is lawful, must occur much oftener, and greater indulgence be given
to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms, than in arbitrary
governments. Not only where the chief magistrate enters into measures, in
themselves, extremely pernicious to the public, but even when he wou'd encroach
on the other parts of the constitution, and extend his power beyond the legal
bounds, it is allowable to resist and dethrone him; tho' such resistance and
violence may, in the general tenor of the laws, be deem'd unlawful and
rebellious. For besides that nothing is more essential to public interest, than
the preservation of public liberty; 'tis evident, that if such a mix'd
government be once suppos'd to be establish'd, every part or member of the
constitution must have a right of self-defence, and of maintaining its antient
bounds against the encroachment of every other authority. As matter wou'd have
been created in vain, were it depriv'd of a power of resistance, without which
no part of it cou'd preserve a distinct existence, and the whole might be
crowded up into a single point: So 'tis a gross absurdity to suppose, in any
government, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the supreme power is shar'd
with the people, without allowing, that 'tis lawful for them to defend their
share against every invader. Those, therefore, who wou'd seem to respect our
free government, and yet deny the right of resistance, have renounc'd all
pretensions to common sense, and do not merit a serious answer.

{#17,pages=564-5} ^It^ does not belong to my present purpose to shew, that these
general principles are applicable to the late _revolution_; and that all the
rights and privileges, which ought to be sacred to a free nation, were at that
time threaten'd with the utmost danger. I am better pleas'd to leave this
controverted |subject, if it really admits of controversy; and to indulge myself
in some philosophical reflections, which naturally arise from that important
event.

{#18,pages=565-6} _First_, We may observe, that shou'd the _lords_ and _commons_
in our constitution, without any reason from public interest, either depose the
king in being, or after his death exclude the prince, who, by laws and settled
custom, ought to succeed, no one wou'd esteem their proceedings legal, or think
themselves bound to comply with them. But shou'd the king, by his unjust
practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and despotic power, justly forfeit
his legal, it then not only becomes morally lawful and suitable to the nature of
political society to dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewise to
think, that the remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of
excluding his next heir, and of chusing whom they please for his successor. This
is founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination. When a
king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the same
situation, as if the king were remov'd by death; unless by mixing himself in the
tyranny, he forfeit it for himself. But tho' this may seem reasonable, we easily
comply with the contrary opinion. The deposition of a king, in such a government
as ours, is certainly an act beyond all common authority, and an illegal
assuming a power for public good, which, in the ordinary course of government,
can belong to no member of the constitution. When the public good is so great
and so evident as to justify the action, the commendable use of this licence
causes us naturally to attribute to the _parliament_ a right of using farther
licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once transgressed with
approbation, we are not apt to be so strict in confining ourselves precisely
within their limits. The mind naturally runs on with any train of action, which
it has begun; nor do we commonly make any scruple concerning our duty, after the
first action of any kind, which we perform. Thus at the _revolution_, {~~no
one->none~~} who thought the deposition of |the father justifiable, esteem'd
themselves to be confin'd to his infant son; tho' had that unhappy monarch died
innocent at that time, and had his son, by any accident, been convey'd beyond
seas, there is no doubt but a regency wou'd have been appointed till he shou'd
come to age, and cou'd be restor'd to his dominions. As the slightest properties
of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people, it shews the
wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of such properties,
and to chuse the magistrates either in or out of a line, according as the vulgar
will most naturally attribute authority and right to them.

{#19,pages=566-7} _Secondly_, Tho' the accession of the _Prince_ of _Orange_ to
the throne might at first give occasion to many disputes, and his title be
contested, it ought not now to appear doubtful, but must have acquir'd a
sufficient authority from those three princes, who have succeeded him upon the
same title. Nothing is more usual, tho' nothing may, at first sight, appear more
unreasonable, than this way of thinking. Princes often _seem_ to acquire a right
from their successors, as well as from their ancestors; and a king, who during
his life-time might justly be deem'd an usurper, will be regarded by posterity
as a lawful prince, because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on
the throne, and entirely change the antient form of government. _Julius
C{ae}sar_ is regarded as the first _Roman_ emperor; while _Sylla_ and _Marius_,
whose titles were really the same as his, are treated as tyrants and usurpers.
Time and custom give authority to all forms of government, and all successions
of princes; and that power, which at first was founded only on injustice and
violence, becomes in time legal and obligatory. Nor does the mind rest there;
but returning back upon its footsteps, transfers to their predecessors and
ancestors that right, which it naturally ascribes to the posterity, as being
related together, and united in the imagination. The present _king_ of _France_
makes _Hugh Capet_ a more lawful prince than _Cromwell_; as the establish'd
|liberty of the _Dutch_ is no inconsiderable apology for their obstinate
resistance to _Philip_ the second.

{#n81,pages=559} It is not here asserted, that _present possession_ or
_conquest_ are sufficient to give a title against _long possession_ and
_positive laws:_ But only that they have some force, and will be able to cast
the ballance where the titles are otherwise equal, and will even be sufficient
_sometimes_ to sanctify the weaker title. What degree of force they have is
difficult to determine. I believe all moderate men will allow, that they have
great force in all disputes concerning the rights of princes.

{#n82,pages=559} To prevent mistakes I must observe, that this case of
succession is not the same with that of hereditary monarchies, where custom has
fix'd the right of succession. These depend upon the principle of long
possession above explain'd.
