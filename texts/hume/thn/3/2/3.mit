£4 _Of the rules, which determine property._ £4

{#1,pages=501-2} THO' the establishment of the rule, concerning the stability of
possession, be not only useful, but even absolutely necessary to human society,
it can never serve to any purpose, |while it remains in such general terms. Some
method must be shewn, by which we may distinguish what particular goods are to
be assign'd to each particular person, while the rest of mankind are excluded
from their possession and enjoyment. Our next business, then, must be to
discover the reasons which modify this general rule, and fit it to the common
use and practice of the world.

{#2,pages=502} '^Tis^ obvious, that those reasons are not deriv'd from any
utility or advantage, which either the _particular_ person or the public may
reap from his enjoyment of any _particular_ goods, beyond what wou'd result from
the possession of them by any other person. 'Twere better, no doubt, that every
one were possess'd of what is most suitable to him, and proper for his use: But
besides, that this relation of fitness may be common to several at once, 'tis
liable to so many controversies, and men are so partial and passionate in
judging of these controversies, that such a loose and uncertain rule wou'd be
absolutely incompatible with the peace of human society. The convention
concerning the stability of possession is enter'd into, in order to cut off all
occasions of discord and contention; and this end wou'd never be attain'd, were
we allow'd to apply this rule differently in every particular case, according to
every particular utility, which might be discover'd in such an application.
Justice, in her decisions, never regards the fitness or unfitness of objects to
particular persons, but conducts herself by more extensive views. Whether a man
be generous, or a miser, he is equally well receiv'd by her, and obtains with
the same facility a decision in his favours, even for what is entirely useless
to him.

{#3,pages=502-3} ^It^ follows, therefore, that the general rule, _that
possession must be stable_, is not apply'd by particular judgments, but by other
general rules, which must extend to the whole society, and be inflexible either
by spite or favour. To illustrate this, I propose the following instance. I
first consider men in their savage and solitary condition; and suppose, that
|being sensible of the misery of that state, and foreseeing the advantages that
wou'd result from society, they seek each other's company, and make an offer of
mutual protection and assistance. I also suppose, that they are endow'd with
such sagacity as immediately to perceive, that the chief impediment to this
project of society and partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their
natural temper; to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the stability
of possession, and for mutual restraint and forbearance. I am sensible, that
this method of proceeding is not altogether natural; but besides that I here
only suppose those reflections to be form'd at once, which in fact arise
insensibly and by degrees; besides this, I say, 'tis very possible, that several
persons, being by different accidents separated from the societies, to which
they formerly belong'd, may be oblig'd to form a new society among themselves;
in which case they are entirely in the situation above-mention'd.

{#4,pages=503-4} '^Tis^ evident, then, that their first difficulty, in this
situation, after the general convention for the establishment of society, and
for the constancy of possession, is, how to separate their possessions, and
assign to each his particular portion, which he must for the future inalterably
enjoy. This difficulty will not detain them long; but it must immediately
{~~occur to them->occur~~}, as the most natural expedient, that every one
continue to enjoy what he is at present master of, and that property or constant
possession be conjoin'd to the immediate possession. Such is the effect of
custom, that it not only reconciles us to any thing we have long enjoy'd, but
even gives us an affection for it, and makes us prefer it to other objects,
which may be more valuable, but are less known to us. What has long lain under
our eye, and has often been employ'd to our advantage, _that_ we are always the
most unwilling to part with; but can easily live without possessions, which we
never have enjoy'd, and are not accustom'd to. 'Tis evident, therefore, that men
wou'd easily acquiesce in this expedient, _that every one continue to enjoy what
he is at present possess'd |of_; and this is the reason, why they wou'd so
naturally agree in preferring it[n71].

{#5,pages=505} ^But^ we may observe, that tho' the rule of the assignment of
property to the present possessor be natural, and by that means useful, yet its
utility extends not beyond the first formation of society; nor wou'd any thing
be more pernicious, than the constant observance of it; by which restitution
wou'd be excluded, and every injustice wou'd be authoriz'd and rewarded. We
must, therefore, seek for some other circumstance, that may give rise to
property after society is once establish'd; and of this kind, I find four most
considerable, _viz._ Occupation, Prescription, Accession, and Succession. We
shall briefly examine each of these, beginning with _Occupation._

{#6,pages=505} ^The^ possession of all external goods is changeable and
uncertain; which is one of the most considerable impediments to the
establishment of society, and is the reason why, by universal agreement, express
or tacite, men restrain themselves by what we now call the rules of justice and
equity. The misery of the condition, which precedes this restraint, is the cause
why we submit to that remedy as quickly as possible; and this affords {--us--}
an easy reason, why we annex the idea of property to the first possession, or to
_occupation_. Men are unwilling to leave property in suspence, even for the
shortest time, or open the least door to violence and disorder. To which we may
add, that the first possession always engages the attention most; and did we
neglect it, there wou'd be no colour of reason for assigning property to any
succeeding possession[n72].

{#7,pages=506} ^There^ remains nothing, but to determine exactly, what is meant
by possession; and this is not so easy as may at first sight be imagin'd. We are
said to be in possession of any thing, not only when we immediately touch it,
but also when we are so situated with respect to it, as to have it in our power
to use it; and may move, alter, or destroy it, according to our present pleasure
or advantage. This relation, then, is a species of cause and effect; and as
property is nothing but a stable possession, deriv'd from the rules of justice,
or the conventions of men, 'tis to be consider'd as the same species of
relation. But here we may observe, that as the power of using any object becomes
more or less certain, according as the interruptions we may meet with are more
or less probable; and as this probability may increase by insensible degrees;
'tis in many cases impossible to determine when possession begins or ends; nor
is there any certain standard, by which we can decide such controversies. A wild
boar, that falls into our snares, is deem'd to be in our possession, if it be
impossible for him to escape. But what do we mean by impossible? How do we
separate this impossibility from an improbability? And how distinguish that
exactly from a probability? Mark the precise limits of the one and the other,
and shew the standard, by which we may decide all disputes that may arise, and,
as we find by experience, frequently do arise upon this subject[n73].

{#8,pages=507} ^But^ such disputes may not only arise concerning the real
existence of property and possession, but also concerning their extent; and
these disputes are often susceptible of no decision, or can be decided by no
other faculty than the imagination. A person who lands on the shore of a small
island, that is desart and uncultivated, is deem'd its possessor from the very
first moment, and acquires the property of the whole; because the object is
there bounded and circumscrib'd in the fancy, and at the same time is
proportion'd to the new possessor. The same person landing on a desart island,
as large as _Great Britain_, extends his property no farther than his immediate
possession; tho' a numerous colony are esteem'd the proprietors of the whole
from the instant of their debarkment.

{#9,pages=507-9} ^But^ it often happens, that the title of first possession
becomes obscure thro' time; and that 'tis impossible to determine many
controversies, which may arise concerning |it. In that case long possession or
_prescription_ naturally takes place, and gives a person a sufficient property
in any thing he enjoys. The nature of human society admits not of any great
accuracy; nor can we always remount to the first origin of things, in order to
determine their present condition. Any considerable space of time sets objects
at such a distance, that they seem, in a manner, to lose their reality, and have
as little influence on the mind, as if they never had been in being. A man's
title, that is clear and certain at present, will seem obscure and doubtful
fifty years hence, even tho' the facts, on which it is founded, shou'd be prov'd
with the greatest evidence and certainty. The same facts have not the same
influence after so long an interval of time. And this may be receiv'd as a
convincing argument for our preceding doctrine with regard to property and
justice. Possession during a long tract of time conveys a title to any object.
But as 'tis certain, that, however every |thing be produc'd in time, there is
nothing real, that is produc'd by time; it follows, that property being produc'd
by time, is not any thing real in the objects, but is the offspring of the
sentiments, on which alone time is found to have any influence[n74].

{#10,pages=509} ^We^ acquire the property of objects by _accession_, when they
are connected in an intimate manner with objects that are already our property,
and at the same time are inferior to them. Thus the fruits of our garden, the
offspring of our cattle, and the work of our slaves, are all of them esteem'd
our property, even before possession. Where objects are connected together in
the imagination, they are apt to be put on the same footing, and are commonly
suppos'd to be endow'd with the same qualities. We readily pass from one to the
other, and make no difference in our judgments concerning them; especially if
the latter be inferior to the former[n75].

{#11,pages=510-13} ^The^ right of _succession_ is a very natural one, from the
presum'd consent of the parent or near relation, and from the general interest
of mankind, which requires, that men's possessions shou'd pass to those, who are
dearest to them, in |order to render them more industrious and frugal. Perhaps
these causes are seconded by the influence of _relation_, or the association of
ideas, by which we are naturally directed to consider the son after the parent's
decease, and ascribe to |him a title to his father's possessions. Those goods
must become the property of some body: But _of whom_ is the question. Here 'tis
evident the persons children naturally present themselves to the mind; and being
already connected |to those possessions by means of their deceas'd parent, we
are apt to connect them still farther by the relation of property. Of this there
are many parallel instances[n76].

{#n71,pages=504-5} No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a
number of causes present themselves for the same ph{ae}nomenon, to determine
which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise
argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of
taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances.
Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for
most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these
rules are principally fix'd by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties
of our thought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving
it to the reader's choice, whether he will prefer those deriv'd from publick
utility, or those deriv'd from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of
the present possessor. //
~~'Tis a quality, which[n71a] I have already observ'd in human nature, that when
two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe
to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this
inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of
the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that
purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and
yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the
impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin'd by causation,
and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new
relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, 'twill easily
be imagin'd, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, 'twill
readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such
objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail,
in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are _resembling_ in
_contiguity_ to each other, or at least in _correspondent_ points of view;
because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of
resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is
easily accounted for from the known properties of human nature. When the mind is
determin'd to join certain objects, but undetermin'd in its choice of the
particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together.
They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to
the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction,
it wou'd require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural
affinity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we
come to treat of _beauty_. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with
observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books
in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contributes to the formation of
society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule
concerning the stability of possession. {~~And as->As~~} property forms a
relation betwixt a person and an object, 'tis natural to found it on some
preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession,
secur'd by the laws |of society, 'tis natural to add it to the present
possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its
influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, 'tis more so, to
conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together.

{#n71a,pages=504} _Book_ I. _Part_ IV. _Sect._ 5.

{#n72,pages=505-6} Some philosophers account for the right of occupation, by
saying, that every one has a property in his own labour; and when he joins that
labour to any thing, it gives him the property of the whole: But, 1. There are
several kinds of occupation, where we cannot be said to join our labour to the
object we acquire: As when we possess a meadow by grazing our cattle upon it. 2.
This accounts for the matter by means of _accession_; which is taking a needless
circuit. 3. We cannot be said to join our labour to any thing but in a
figurative sense. Properly speaking, |we only make an alteration on it by our
labour. This forms a relation betwixt us and the object; and thence arises the
property, according to the preceding principles.

{#n73,pages=506-8} If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and
public interest, we never shall find satisfaction; and if we look for it in the
imagination, 'tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty,
run so insensibly and gradually into each other, that 'tis impossible to give
them any precise bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head must
encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to
the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem'd possession in
one case, which is not esteem'd such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare
to the last degree of weariness, wou'd look upon it as an injustice for another
to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to
pluck an apple, that hangs within his reach, has no reason to complain, if
another, more alert, passes |him, and takes possession. What is the reason of
this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the
effect of industry, forms in that case a strong relation with the hunter, which
is wanting in the other? Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible
power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often
produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without
any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The
sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as
such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that
the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, _that even a whole
continent belongs to the nation, which first discover'd it_. 'Tis however
remarkable, that both in the case of discovery and that of possession, the first
discoverer and possessor must join to the relation an intention of rendering
himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that
because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not
so great, but that it requires to be help'd by such an intention. From all these
circumstances, 'tis easy to see how perplex'd many questions may become
concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of
thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any
reasonable decision. If we prefer examples, which are real, to such as are
feign'd, we may consider the following one, which is to be met with in almost
every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature. Two _Grecian_ colonies,
leaving their native country, in search of new seats, were inform'd that a city
near them was deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth of this report,
they dispatch'd at once |two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on
their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an
intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One
of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other,
launch'd his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it
there before the arrival of his companion. This produc'd a dispute betwixt the
two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this
dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part I find the dispute
impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the
fancy, which in this case is not possess'd of any precise or determinate
standard, upon which it can give sentence. To make this evident, let us
consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and
not messengers or deputies, their actions wou'd not have been of any
consequence; since in that case their relation to the colonies wou'd have been
but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin'd them to run to
the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the
gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in
taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their
images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or
contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the
piercing the gates with a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a
relation, in the other case, equally obvious, tho' not, perhaps, of equal force.
Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of
them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser
than myself.

{#n74,pages=509} Present possession is plainly a relation betwixt a person and
an object; but is not sufficient to counter-ballance the relation of first
possession, unless the former be long and uninterrupted: In which case the
relation is encreas'd on the side of the present possession, by the extent of
time, and diminish'd on that of first possession, by the distance. This change
in the relation produces a consequent change in the property.

{#n75,pages=509-13} This source of property can never be explain'd but from the
imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix'd. We shall
proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from
common life and experience. It has been observ'd above, that the mind has a
natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a
kind of fitness and uniformity in such an union. From this propensity are
deriv'd these laws of nature, _that upon the first formation of society,
property always follows the present possession_; and afterwards, _that it arises
from first or from long possession_. Now we may easily observe, that relation is
not confin'd merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to
us, we acquire a relation to every other object, which is related to it, and so
on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the
relation may weaken by each remove, 'tis not immediately destroy'd; but
frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is
related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the
right of _accession_, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such
objects as we are immediately possess'd of, but also of such as are closely
connected with them. //
~~Suppose a _German_, a _Frenchman_, and a _Spaniard_ to come into a room where
there are plac'd upon the table three bottles of wine, |_Rhenish_, _Burgundy_
and _Port_; and suppose they shou'd fall a quarrelling about the division of
them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou'd naturally, to shew his
impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a
principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that
ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession. In all these cases,
and particularly that of accession, there is first a _natural_ union betwixt the
idea of the person and that of the object, and afterwards a new and  _moral_
union produc'd by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But
here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an
opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has
been employ'd on the present subject. I have already observ'd, that the
imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great
to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the
former case than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the
easy transition of ideas, by which related objects are connected together, it
shou'd naturally be imagin'd, that the right of accession must encrease in
strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform'd with greater
facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir'd the property
of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as
an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; since the
transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and
shou'd connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is
always found to be otherwise. The empire of _Great Britain_ seems to draw along
with it the dominion of the _Orkneys_, the _Hebrides_, the isle of _Man_, and
the isle of _Wight_; but the authority over those lesser islands does not
naturally imply any title to  _Great Britain_. In short, a small object
naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never
suppos'd to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on
account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of
ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his
property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case
from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It
may therefore be thought, that these ph{ae}nomena are objections to the
foregoing hypothesis, _that the ascribing of property to accession is nothing
but an {~~affect->effect~~} of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth
transition of the imagination_. 'Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we
consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different
views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a
person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one
object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be
consider'd as the property of the person, we are apt to join them |together, and
place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to
be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he
will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider'd together,
because be is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be
only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both,
consider'd together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part,
which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole.
And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and
not great to small. 'Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that
the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because
'tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation
with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases,
property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the
liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as
an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have
properly no more bond or union with the land, than the _pacific_ ocean wou'd
have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the same time _inferior_,
they are of course regarded as an accession. The property of rivers, by the laws
of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the
proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the _Rhine_ or the
_Danube_, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the
property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are consider'd as the
property of that nation, thro' whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation
being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation
in the fancy. The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers,
follow the land, say the civilians, provided {~~it->they~~} be made by what they
call _alluvion_, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances
that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any
considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join'd to another, it
becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land,
and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the
imagination does not sufficiently join them. There are other cases, which
somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably
different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the
properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of
_separation_. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong. Where this
conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of _division_, but not of
_separation_, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos'd
to be common betwixt the proprietors of the |several parts, and afterwards must
be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But here I cannot
forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the _Roman_ law, in
distinguishing betwixt _confusion_ and _commixtion_. Confusion is an union of
two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely
undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels
of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in
the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the
former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of
each; this is the reason, why the _civil_ law, tho' it establish'd an entire
community in the case of _confusion_, and after that a proportional division,
yet in the case of _commixtion_, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a
distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same
division. _Quod si frumentum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex
voluntate vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana,
qu{ae} cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt. Quod si
casu id mistum fuerit, vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate, non videtur
id commune esse; quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant. Sed nec magis
istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis, si
pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint. Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id
frumentum retineatur, in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusque competit.
Arbitrio autem judicis, ut ipse {ae}stimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit._
Inst. Lib. II. Tit. 1. \S. 28. Where the properties of two persons are united
after such a manner as neither to admit of _division_ nor _separation_, as when
one builds a house on another's ground, in that case, the whole must belong to
one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv'd to
belong to the proprietor of the most considerable part. For however the compound
object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once
to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our
attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason,
the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as
his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas'd to call the most
considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination. This quality depends
on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other.
One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either
because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because
it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because
its existence is more separate and independent. 'Twill be easy to conceive,
that, as these circumstances may be conjoin'd and oppos'd in all the different
ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be |imagin'd, there
will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally
ballanc'd, that 'tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here
then is the proper business of municipal laws, to fix what the principles of
human nature have left undetermin'd. The superficies yields to the soil, says
the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These
decisions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the contrariety of
those principles, from which they are deriv'd. But of all the questions of this
kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of
_Proculus_ and _Sabinus_. Suppose a person shou'd make a cup from the metal of
another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or
wood shou'd demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to
the cup or ship. _Sabinus_ maintain'd the affirmative, and asserted that the
substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is
incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual
and dependent. On the other hand, _Proculus_ observ'd, that the form is the most
obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or
that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or
substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that 'tis utterly
impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what
principles such a controversy can be certainly determin'd. I shall therefore
content my self with observing, that the decision of _Trebonian_ seems to me
pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because
it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the
author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this reason may
seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a
reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the
proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood,
where the substance is more fix'd and unalterable.

{#n76,pages=513} In examining the different titles to authority in government,
we shall meet with many reasons to convince us, that the right of succession
depends, {~~in a great, measure->in a great measure,~~} on the imagination. Mean
while I shall rest contented with observing one example, which belongs to the
present subject. Suppose that a person die without children, and that a dispute
arises among his relations concerning his inheritance; 'tis evident, that if his
riches be deriv'd partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most
natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his possessions, and
assign each part to the family, from whence it is deriv'd. Now as the person is
suppos'd to have been once the full and entire proprietor of those goods; I ask,
what is it makes us find a certain equity and natural reason in this partition,
except it be the imagination? His affection to these families does not depend
upon his possessions; for which reason his consent can never be presum'd
precisely for such a partition. And as to the public interest, it seems not to
be in the least concern'd on the one side or the other.
