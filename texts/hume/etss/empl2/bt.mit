£1 Of the ^Balance^ of ^Trade^. £1

{#1,pages=308} IT is very usual, in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce,
to prohibit the exportation of commodities, and to preserve among themselves
whatever they think valuable and useful. They do not consider, that, in this
prohibition, they act directly contrary to their intention; and that the more is
exported of any commodity, the more will be raised at home, of which they
themselves will always have the first offer.

{#2,pages=308-9} It is well known to the learned, that the ancient laws of
^Athens^ rendered the exportation of figs criminal; that being supposed a
species of fruit so excellent in ^Attica^, that the ^Athenians^ deemed it too
delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in this ridiculous prohibition
they were so much in earnest, that informers were thence called _sycophants_
|among them, from two ^Greek^ words, which signify _figs_ and _discoverer_[n1].
There are proofs in many old acts of parliament of the same ignorance in the
nature of commerce, particularly in the reign of ^Edward III^. And to this day,
in ^France^, the exportation of corn is almost always prohibited; in order, as
they say, to prevent famines; though it is evident, that nothing contributes
more to the frequent famines, which so much distress that fertile country.

{#3,pages=309} The same jealous fear, with regard to money, has also prevailed
among several nations; and it required both reason and experience to convince
any people, that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the
exchange against them, and produce a still greater exportation.

{#4,pages=309-10} These errors, one may say, are gross and palpable: But there
still prevails, even in nations well acquainted with commerce, a strong jealousy
with regard to the balance of trade, and a fear, that all their gold and silver
may be leaving them. This seems to me, almost in every case, a groundless
apprehension; and I should as soon dread, that all our springs and rivers should
be exhausted, as that money should abandon a kingdom where there are people and
industry. Let us carefully |preserve these latter advantages; and we need never
be apprehensive of losing the former.

{#5,pages=310} It is easy to observe, that all calculations concerning the
balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions. The
custom-house books are allowed to be an insufficient ground of reasoning; nor is
the rate of exchange much better; unless we consider it with all nations, and
know also the proportions of the several sums remitted; which one may safely
pronounce impossible. Every man, who has ever reasoned on this subject, has
always proved his theory, whatever it was, by facts and calculations, and by an
enumeration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms.

{#6,pages=310} The writings of Mr. {~~Gee->^Gee^~~} struck the nation with an
universal panic, when they saw it plainly demonstrated, by a detail of
particulars, that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must
leave them without a single shilling in five or six years. But luckily, twenty
years have since elapsed, with an expensive foreign war; yet is it commonly
supposed, that money is still more plentiful among us than in any former period.

{#7,pages=310-1} Nothing can be more entertaining on this head than Dr. ^Swift^;
an author so quick in discerning the mistakes and absurdities of others. He
says, in his _short view of the state of ^Ireland^_, that the whole cash of that
kingdom formerly amounted but to 500,000_l._; that out of this the ^Irish^
remitted every year a neat million to ^England^, and had scarcely any other
source from which they could compensate themselves, and little other foreign
trade than the importation of ^French^ wines, for which they paid ready money.
The consequence of this situation, which must be owned to be disadvantageous,
was, that, in a course of three years, the current money of |^Ireland^, from
500,000_l._ was reduced to less than two. And at present, I suppose, in a course
of 30 years it is absolutely nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the
advance of riches in ^Ireland^, which gave the Doctor so much indignation, seems
still to continue, and gain ground with every body.

{#8,pages=311} In short, this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade,
appears of such a nature, that it discovers itself, wherever one is out of
humour with the ministry, or is in low spirits; and as it can never be refuted
by a particular detail of all the exports, which counterbalance the imports, it
may here be proper to form a general argument, that may prove the impossibility
of this event, as long as we preserve our people and our industry.

{#9,pages=311} Suppose four-fifths of all the money in ^Great Britain^ to be
annihilated in one night, and the nation reduced to the same condition, with
regard to specie, as in the reigns of the ^Harrys^ and ^Edwards^, what would be
the consequence? Must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in
proportion, and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages? What
nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market, or pretend to navigate
or to sell manufactures at the same price, which to us would afford sufficient
profit? In how little time, therefore, must this bring back the money which we
had lost, and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where,
after we have arrived, we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of
labour and commodities; and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our
fulness and repletion.

{#10,pages=311-2} Again, suppose, that all the money of ^Great Britain^ were
multiplied fivefold in a night, must not the contrary effect follow? Must not
all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height, that no
neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us; while their commodities, on
the other hand, became comparatively so cheap, that, in spite of all the laws
which could be formed, they would be run in upon us, and our money flow out;
till we fall to a level with foreigners, |and lose that great superiority of
riches, which had laid us under such disadvantages?

{#11,pages=312} Now, it is evident, that the same causes, which would correct
these exorbitant inequalities, were they to happen miraculously, must prevent
their happening in the common course of nature, and must for ever, in all
neighbouring nations, preserve money nearly proportionable to the art and
industry of each nation. All water, wherever it communicates, remains always at
a level. Ask naturalists the reason; they tell you, that, were it to be raised
in any one place, the superior gravity of that part not being balanced, must
depress it, till it meet a counterpoise; and that the same cause, which
redresses the inequality when it happens, must for ever prevent it, without some
violent external operation[n2].

{#12,pages=312} Can one imagine, that it had ever been possible, by any laws, or
even by any art or industry, to have kept all the money in ^Spain^, which the
galleons have brought from the ^Indies^? Or that all commodities could be sold
in ^France^ for a tenth of the price which they would yield on the other side of
the ^Pyrenees^, without finding their way thither, and draining from that
immense treasure? What other reason, indeed, is there, why all nations, at
present, gain in their trade with ^Spain^ and ^Portugal^; but because it is
impossible to heap up money, more than any fluid, beyond its proper level? The
sovereigns of these countries have shown, that they wanted not inclination to
keep their gold and silver to themselves, had it been in any degree practicable.

{#13,pages=312-3} But as any body of water may be raised above the level of the
surrounding element, if the former has no communication with the latter; so in
money, if the communication be cut off, |by any material or physical impediment,
(for all laws alone are ineffectual) there may, in such a case, be a very great
inequality of money. Thus the immense distance of ^China^, together with the
monopolies of our ^India^ companies, obstructing the communication, preserve in
^Europe^ the gold and silver, especially the latter, in much greater plenty than
they are found in that kingdom. But, notwithstanding this great obstruction, the
force of the causes abovementioned is still evident. The skill and ingenuity of
^Europe^ in general surpasses perhaps that of ^China^, with regard to manual
arts and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade thither without great
disadvantage. And were it not for the continual recruits, which we receive from
^America^, money would soon sink in ^Europe^, and rise in ^China^, till it came
nearly to a level in both places. Nor can any reasonable man doubt, but that
industrious nation, were they as near us as ^Poland^ or ^Barbary^, would drain
us of the overplus of our specie, and draw to themselves a larger share of the
^West Indian^ treasures. We need not have recourse to a physical attraction, in
order to explain the necessity of this operation. There is a moral attraction,
arising from the interests and passions of men, which is full as potent and
infallible.

{#14,pages=313-4} How is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom
among themselves, but by the force of this principle, which makes it impossible
for money to lose its level, and either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of
the labour and commodities which are in each province? Did not long experience
make people easy on this head, what a fund of gloomy reflections might
calculations afford to a melancholy ^Yorkshireman^, while he computed and
magnified the sums drawn to |^London^ by taxes, absentees, commodities, and
found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior? And no doubt, had
the _Heptarchy_ subsisted in ^England^, the legislature of each state had been
continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong balance; and as it is probable that
the mutual hatred of these states would have been extremely violent on account
of their close neighbourhood, they would have loaded and oppressed all commerce,
by a jealous and superfluous caution. Since the union has removed the barriers
between ^Scotland^ and ^England^, which of these nations gains from the other by
this free commerce? Or if the former kingdom has received any encrease of
riches, can it reasonably be accounted for by any thing but the encrease of its
art and industry? It was a common apprehension in ^England^, before the union,
as we learn from ^L'Abbe du Bos^[n3], that ^Scotland^ would soon drain them of
their treasure, were an open trade allowed; and on the other side the ^Tweed^ a
contrary apprehension prevailed: With what justice in both, time has shown.

{#15,pages=314-5} What happens in small portions of mankind, must take place in
greater. The provinces of the ^Roman^ empire, no doubt, kept their balance with
each other, and with ^Italy^, independent of the legislature; as much as the
several counties of ^Great Britain^, or the several parishes of each county. And
any man who travels over ^Europe^ at this day, may see, by the prices of
commodities, that money, in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states,
has brought itself nearly to a level; and that the difference between one
kingdom and another is not greater in this respect, than it is often between
different provinces of the same kingdom. Men naturally flock to capital cities,
sea-ports, and navigable rivers. There we find |more men, more industry, more
commodities, and consequently more money; but still the latter difference holds
proportion with the former, and the level is preserved[n4].

{#16,pages=315} Our jealousy and our hatred of ^France^ are without bounds; and
the former sentiment, at least, must be acknowledged reasonable and
well-grounded. These passions have occasioned innumerable barriers and
obstructions upon commerce, where we are accused of being commonly the
aggressors. But what have we gained by the bargain? We lost the ^French^ market
for our woollen manufactures, and transferred the commerce of wine to ^Spain^
and ^Portugal^, where we buy worse liquor at a higher price. There are few
^Englishmen^ who would not think their country absolutely ruined, were ^French^
wines sold in ^England^ so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant, in some
measure, all ale, and home-brewed liquors: But would we lay aside prejudice, it
would not be difficult to prove, that nothing could be more innocent, perhaps
advantageous. Each new acre of vineyard planted in ^France^, in order to supply
^England^ with wine, would make it requisite for the ^French^ to take the
produce of an ^English^ acre, sown in wheat or barley, in order to subsist
themselves; and it is evident, that we should thereby get command of the better
commodity.

{#17,pages=315-6} There are many edicts of the ^French^ king, prohibiting the
planting of new vineyards, and ordering all those which |are lately planted to
be grubbed up: So sensible are they, in that country, of the superior value of
corn, above every other product.

{#18,pages=316} Mareschal ^Vauban^ complains often, and with reason, of the
absurd duties which load the entry of those wines of ^Languedoc^, ^Guienne^, and
other southern provinces, that are imported into ^Britanny^ and ^Normandy^. He
entertained no doubt but these latter provinces could preserve their balance,
notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommends. And it is evident, that a
few leagues more navigation to ^England^ would make no difference; or if it did,
that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms.

{#19,pages=316} There is indeed one expedient by which it is possible to sink,
and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom;
but these cases, when examined, will be found to resolve into our general
theory, and to bring additional authority to it.

{#20,pages=316-7} I scarcely know any method of sinking money below its level,
but those institutions of banks, funds, and paper-credit, which are so much
practised in this kingdom. These render paper equivalent to money, circulate it
throughout the whole state, make it supply the place of gold and silver, raise
proportionably the price of labour and commodities, and by that means either
banish a great part of those precious metals, or prevent their farther encrease.
What can be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head? We fancy,
because an individual would be much richer, were his stock of money doubled,
that the same good effect would follow were the money of every one encreased;
not considering, that this would raise as much the price of every commodity, and
reduce every man, in time, to the same condition as before. It is only in our
public negociations and transactions with foreigners, that a greater stock of
money is advantageous; and as our paper |is there absolutely insignificant, we
feel, by its means, all the ill effects arising from a great abundance of money,
without reaping any of the advantages[n5].

{#21,pages=317} Suppose that there are 12 millions of paper, which circulate in
the kingdom as money, (for we are not to imagine, that all our enormous funds
are employed in that shape) and suppose the real cash of the kingdom to be 18
millions: Here is a state which is found by experience to be able to hold a
stock of 30 millions. I say, if it be able to hold it, it must of necessity have
acquired it in gold and silver, had we not obstructed the entrance of these
metals by this new invention of paper. _Whence would it have acquired that sum?_
From all the kingdoms of the world. _But why?_ Because, if you remove these 12
millions, money in this state is below its level, compared with our neighbours;
and we must immediately draw from all of them, till we be full and saturate, so
to speak, and can hold no more. By our present politics, we are as careful to
stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bank-bills and chequer-notes, as if
we were afraid of being overburthened with the precious metals.

{#22,pages=317} It is not to be doubted, but the great plenty of bullion in
^France^ is, in a great measure, owing to the want of paper-credit. The ^French^
have no banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as with us: Usury or
lending on interest is not directly permitted; so that many have large sums in
their coffers: Great quantities of plate are used in private houses; and all the
churches are full of it. By this means, provisions and labour still remain
cheaper among them, than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and
silver. The advantages of this situation, in point of trade as well as in great
public emergencies, are too evident to be disputed.

{#23,pages=318} The same fashion a few years ago prevailed in ^Genoa^, which
still has place in ^England^ and ^Holland^, of using services of ^China^-ware
instead of plate; but the senate, foreseeing the consequence, prohibited the use
of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent; while the use of silver-plate
was left unlimited. And I suppose, in their late distresses, they felt the good
effect of this ordinance. Our tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view, somewhat
impolitic.

{#24,pages=318} Before the introduction of paper-money into our colonies, they
had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation. Since the introduction of
that commodity, the least inconveniency that has followed is the total
banishment of the precious metals. And after the abolition of paper, can it be
doubted but money will return, while these colonies possess manufactures and
commodities, the only thing valuable in commerce, and for whose sake alone all
men desire money.

{#25,pages=318} What pity ^Lycurgus^ did not think of paper-credit, when he
wanted to banish gold and silver from ^Sparta^! It would have served his purpose
better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money; and would also have
prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers, as being of so much less
real and intrinsic value.

{#26,pages=318-9} It must, however, be confessed, that, as all these questions
of trade and money are extremely complicated, there are certain lights, in which
this subject may be placed, so as to represent the advantages of paper-credit
and banks to be superior to their disadvantages. That they banish specie and
bullion from a state is undoubtedly true; and whoever looks no farther than this
circumstance does well to condemn them; but specie and bullion are not of so
great consequence as not to admit of a compensation, and even an overbalance
from the encrease of industry and of credit, which may be promoted by the right
use of paper-money. It is well known of what advan|tage it is to a merchant to
be able to discount his bills upon occasion; and every thing that facilitates
this species of traffic is favourable to the general commerce of a state. But
private bankers are enabled to give such credit by the credit they receive from
the depositing of money in their shops; and the bank of ^England^ in the same
manner, from the liberty it has to issue its notes in all payments. There was an
invention of this kind, which was fallen upon some years ago by the banks of
^Edinburgh^; and which, as it is one of the most ingenious ideas that has been
executed in commerce, has also been thought advantageous to ^Scotland^. It is
there called a ^Bank-Credit^; and is of this nature. A man goes to the bank and
finds surety to the amount, we shall suppose, of a thousand pounds. This money,
or any part of it, he has the liberty of drawing out whenever he pleases, and he
pays only the ordinary interest for it, while it is in his hands. He may, when
he pleases, repay any sum so small as twenty pounds, and the interest is
discounted from the very day of the repayment. The advantages, resulting from
this contrivance, are manifold. As a man may find surety nearly to the amount of
his substance, and his bank-credit is equivalent to ready money, a merchant does
hereby in a manner coin his houses, his household furniture, the goods in his
warehouse, the foreign debts due to him, his ships at sea; and can, upon
occasion, employ them in all payments, as if they were the current money of the
country. If a man borrow a thousand pounds from a private hand, besides that it
is not always to be found when required, he pays interest for it, whether he be
using it or not: His bank-credit costs him nothing except during the very
moment, in which it is of service to him: And this circumstance is of equal
advantage as if he had borrowed money at much lower interest. Merchants,
likewise, from this invention, acquire a great facility in supporting each
other's credit, which is a considerable security against bankruptcies. A man,
when his own bank-credit is exhausted, goes to any of his neighbours who is not
in the same condition; and he gets the money, which he replaces at his
convenience.

{#27,pages=320} After this practice had taken place during some years at
^Edinburgh^, several companies of merchants at ^Glasgow^ carried the matter
farther. They associated themselves into different banks, and issued notes so
low as ten shillings, which they used in all payments for goods, manufactures,
tradesmen's labour of all kinds; and these notes, from the established credit of
the companies, passed as money in all payments throughout the country. By this
means, a stock of five thousand pounds was able to perform the same operations
as if it were six or seven; and merchants were thereby enabled to trade to a
greater extent, and to require less profit in all their transactions. But
whatever other advantages result from these inventions, it must still be allowed
that, besides giving too great facility to credit, which is dangerous, they
banish the precious metals; and nothing can be a more evident proof of it, than
a comparison of the past and present condition of ^Scotland^ in that particular.
It was found, upon the recoinage made after the union, that there was near a
million of specie in that country: But notwithstanding the great encrease of
riches, commerce and manufactures of all kinds, it is thought, that, even where
there is no extraordinary drain made by ^England^, the current specie will not
now amount to a third of that sum.

{#28,pages=320-1} But as our projects of paper-credit are almost the only
expedient, by which we can sink money below its level; so, in my opinion, the
only expedient, by which we can raise money above it, is a practice which we
should all exclaim against as destructive, namely, the gathering of large sums
into a public treasure, locking them up, and absolutely preventing their
circulation. The fluid, not communicating with the neighbouring element, may, by
such an artifice, be raised to what height we please. To prove this, we need
only return to our first supposition, of annihilating the half or any part of
our cash; where we found, that the immediate consequence of such an event would
be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms. Nor does
there seem to be any necessary bounds set, by the nature of things, to this
practice |of hoarding. A small city, like ^Geneva^, continuing this policy for
ages, might engross nine-tenths of the money of ^Europe^. There seems, indeed,
in the nature of man, an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches. A
weak state, with an enormous treasure, will soon become a prey to some of its
poorer, but more powerful neighbours. A great state would dissipate its wealth
in dangerous and ill-concerted projects; and probably destroy, with it, what is
much more valuable, the industry, morals, and numbers of its people. The fluid,
in this case, raised to too great a height, bursts and destroys the vessel that
contains it; and mixing itself with the surrounding element, soon falls to its
proper level.

{#29,pages=321} So little are we commonly acquainted with this principle, that,
though all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event, as the
immense treasure amassed by ^Harry VII.^ (which they make amount to 2,700,000
pounds,) we rather reject their concurring testimony, than admit of a fact,
which agrees so ill with our inveterate prejudices. It is indeed probable, that
this sum might be three-fourths of all the money in ^England^. But where is the
difficulty in conceiving, that such a sum might be amassed in twenty years, by a
cunning, rapacious, frugal, and almost absolute monarch? Nor is it probable,
that the diminution of circulating money was ever sensibly felt by the people,
or ever did them any prejudice. The sinking of the prices of all commodities
would immediately replace it, by giving ^England^ the advantage in its commerce
with the neighbouring kingdoms.

{#30,pages=321-2} Have we not an instance, in the small republic of ^Athens^
with its allies, who, in about fifty years, between the ^Median^ and
^Peloponnesian^ wars, amassed a sum not much inferior to that of ^Harry VII.^?
For all the ^Greek^ historians[n6] and orators[n7] agree, that the ^Athenians^
collected in the citadel |more than 10,000 talents, which they afterwards
dissipated to their own ruin, in rash and imprudent enterprizes. But when this
money was set a running, and began to communicate with the surrounding fluid;
what was the consequence? Did it remain in the state? No. For we find, by the
memorable _census_ mentioned by ^Demosthenes^[n8] and ^Polybius^[n9], that, in
about fifty years afterwards, the whole value of the republic, comprehending
lands, houses, commodities, slaves, and money, was less than 6000 talents.

{#31,pages=322} What an ambitious high-spirited people was this, to collect and
keep in their treasury, with a view to conquests, a sum, which it was every day
in the power of the citizens, by a single vote, to distribute among themselves,
and which would have gone near to triple the riches of every individual! For we
must observe, that the numbers and private riches of the ^Athenians^ are said,
by ancient writers, to have been no greater at the beginning of the
^Peloponnesian^ war, than at the beginning of the ^Macedonian^.

{#32,pages=322-3} Money was little more plentiful in ^Greece^ during the age of
^Philip^ and ^Perseus^, than in ^England^ during that of ^Harry VII.^: Yet these
two monarchs in thirty years[n10] collected from the small kingdom of ^Macedon^,
a larger treasure than that of the ^English^ monarch. ^Paulus^ ^{AE}milius^
brought to ^Rome^ about 1,700,000 pounds _Sterling_[n11]. ^Pliny^ says,
2,400,000[n12]. And that was but a part of the ^Macedonian^ |treasure. The rest
was dissipated by the resistance and flight of ^Perseus^[n13].

{#33,pages=323} We may learn from ^Stanian^, that the canton of ^Berne^ had
300,000 pounds lent at interest, and had above six times as much in their
treasury. Here then is a sum hoarded of 1,800,000 pounds _Sterling_, which is at
least quadruple what should naturally circulate in such a petty state; and yet
no one, who travels in the ^Pais de Vaux^, or any part of that canton, observes
any want of money more than could be supposed in a country of that extent, soil,
and situation. On the contrary, there are scarce any inland provinces in the
continent of ^France^ or ^Germany^, where the inhabitants are at this time so
opulent, though that canton has vastly encreased its treasure since 1714, the
time when ^Stanian^ wrote his judicious account of ^Switzerland^[n14].

{#34,pages=323} The account given by ^Appian^[n15] of the treasure of the
^Ptolemies^, is so prodigious, that one cannot admit of it; and so much the
less, because the historian says, that the other successors of ^Alexander^ were
also frugal, and had many of them treasures not much inferior. For this saving
humour of the neighbouring princes must necessarily have checked the frugality
of the ^Egyptian^ monarchs, according to the foregoing theory. The sum he
mentions is 740,000 talents, or 191,166,666 pounds 13 shillings and 4 pence,
according to Dr. ^Arbuthnot^'s computation. And yet ^Appian^ says, that he
extracted his account from the public records; and he was himself a native of
^Alexandria^.

{#35,pages=324} From these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to
form of those numberless bars, obstructions, and imposts, which all nations of
^Europe^, and none more than ^England^, have put upon trade; from an exorbitant
desire of amassing money, which never will heap up beyond its level, while it
circulates; or from an ill-grounded apprehension of losing their specie, which
never will sink below it. Could any thing scatter our riches, it would be such
impolitic contrivances. But this general ill effect, however, results from them,
that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free communication and exchange
which the Author of the world has intended, by giving them soils, climates, and
geniuses, so different from each other.

{#36,pages=324} Our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money,
the using of paper-credit; they reject the only method of amassing it, the
practice of hoarding; and they adopt a hundred contrivances, which serve to no
purpose but to check industry, and rob ourselves and our neighbours of the
common benefits of art and nature.

{#37,pages=324-5} All taxes, however, upon foreign commodities, are not to be
regarded as prejudicial or useless, but those only which are founded on the
jealousy above-mentioned. A tax on {~~German->^German^~~} linen encourages home
manufactures, and thereby multiplies our people and industry. A tax on brandy
encreases the sale of rum, and supports our southern colonies. And as it is
necessary, that imposts should be levied, for the support of government, it may
be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities, which can easily
be intercepted at the port, and subjected to the impost. We ought, however,
always to remember the maxim of Dr. ^Swift^, That, in the arithmetic of the
customs, two and two make not four, but often make only one. It can scarcely be
doubted, but if the duties on |wine were lowered to a third, they would yield
much more to the government than at present: Our people might thereby afford to
drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor; and no prejudice would ensue
to the balance of trade, of which we are so jealous. The manufacture of ale
beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable, and gives employment to few hands.
The transport of wine and corn would not be much inferior.

{#38,pages=325-6} But are there not frequent instances, you will say, of states
and kingdoms, which were formerly rich and opulent, and are now poor and
beggarly? Has not the money left them, with which they formerly abounded? I
answer, If they lose their trade, industry, and people, they cannot expect to
keep their gold and silver: For these precious metals will hold proportion to
the former advantages. When ^Lisbon^ and ^Amsterdam^ got the ^East-India^ trade
from ^Venice^ and ^Genoa^, they also got the profits and money which arose from
it. Where the seat of government is transferred, where expensive armies are
maintained at a distance, where great funds are possessed by foreigners; there
naturally follows from these causes a diminution of the specie. But these, we
may observe, are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money, and are in
time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry. But where
these remain, and the drain is not continued, the money always finds its way
back again, by a hundred canals, of which we have no notion or suspicion. What
immense treasures have been spent, by so many nations, in ^Flanders^, since the
revolution, in the course of three long wars? More |money perhaps than the half
of what is at present in ^Europe^. But what has now become of it? Is it in the
narrow compass of the ^Austrian^ provinces? No, surely: It has most of it
returned to the several countries whence it came, and has followed that art and
industry, by which at first it was acquired. For above a thousand years, the
money of ^Europe^ has been flowing to ^Rome^, by an open and sensible current;
but it has been emptied by many secret and insensible canals: And the want of
industry and commerce renders at present the papal dominions the poorest

{#39,pages=326} In short, a government has great reason to preserve with care
its people and its manufactures. Its money, it may safely trust to the course of
human affairs, without fear or jealousy. Or if it ever give attention to this
latter circumstance, it ought only to be so far as it affects the former.

{#n2,pages=312} There is another cause, though more limited in its operation,
which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every particular nation to which the
kingdom trades. When we import more goods than we export, the exchange turns
against us, and this becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the
charge of carriage and insurance of the money which becomes due would amount to.
For the exchange can never rise but a little higher than that sum.

{#n4.1,pages=315} IT must carefully be remarked, that throughout this discourse,
wherever I speak of the level of money, I mean always its proportional level to
the commodities, labour, industry, and skill, which is in the several states.
And I assert, that where these advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what
they are in the neighbouring states, the money infallibly will also be double,
triple, quadruple. The only circumstance that can obstruct the exactness of
these proportions, is the expence of transporting the commodities from one place
to another; and this expence is sometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle,
cheese, butter, of ^Derbyshire^, cannot draw the money of ^London^, so much as
the manufactures of ^London^ draw the money of ^Derbyshire^. But this objection
is only a seeming one: For so far as the transport of commodities is expensive,
so far is the communication between the places obstructed and imperfect.

{#n5,pages=317} We observed in Essay III. {++[Of Money]++} that money, when
encreasing, gives encouragement to industry, during the interval between the
encrease of money and rise of the prices. A good effect of this nature may
follow too from paper-credit; but it is dangerous to precipitate matters, at the
risk of losing all by the failing of that credit, as must happen upon any
violent shock in public affairs.

{#n14,pages=323} The poverty which ^Stanian^ speaks of is only to be seen in the
most mountainous cantons, where there is no commodity to bring money. And even
there the people are not poorer than in the diocese of ^Saltsburgh^ on the one
hand, or ^Savoy^ on the other.
