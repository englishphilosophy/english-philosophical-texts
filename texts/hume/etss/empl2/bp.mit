£1 Of the ^Balance^ of ^Power^. £1

{#1,pages=332} IT is a question whether the _idea_ of the balance of power be
owing entirely to modern policy, or whether the _phrase_ only has been invented
in these later ages? It is certain, that ^Xenophon^[n1], in his Institution of
^Cyrus^, represents the combination of the ^Asiatic^ powers to have arisen from
a jealousy of the encreasing force of the ^Medes^ and ^Persians^; and though
that elegant composition should be supposed altogether a romance, this
sentiment, ascribed by the author to the eastern princes, is at least a proof of
the prevailing notion of ancient times.

{#2,pages=332-3} In all the politics of ^Greece^, the anxiety, with regard to
|the balance of power, is apparent, and is expressly pointed out to us, even by
the ancient historians. ^Thucydides^[n2] represents the league, which was formed
against ^Athens^, and which produced the ^Peloponnesian^ war, as entirely owing
to this principle. And after the decline of ^Athens^, when the ^Thebans^ and
^Lacedemonians^ disputed for sovereignty, we find, that the ^Athenians^ (as well
as many other republics) always threw themselves into the lighter scale, and
endeavoured to preserve the balance. They supported ^Thebes^ against ^Sparta^,
till the great victory gained by ^Epaminondas^ at ^Leuctra^; after which they
immediately went over to the conquered, from generosity, as they pretended, but
in reality from their jealousy of the conquerors[n3].

{#3,pages=333} Whoever will read ^Demosthenes^'s oration for the
^Megalopolitans^, may see the utmost refinements on this principle, that ever
entered into the head of a ^Venetian^ or ^English^ speculatist. And upon the
first rise of the ^Macedonian^ power, this orator immediately discovered the
danger, sounded the alarm throughout all ^Greece^, and at last assembled that
confederacy under the banners of ^Athens^, which fought the great and decisive
battle of ^Chaeronea^.

{#4,pages=334} It is true, the ^Grecian^ wars are regarded by historians as wars
of emulation rather than of politics; and each state seems to have had more in
view the honour of leading the rest, than any well-grounded hopes of authority
and dominion. If we consider, indeed, the small number of inhabitants in any one
republic, compared to the whole, the great difficulty of forming sieges in those
times, and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman among that
noble people; we shall conclude, that the balance of power was, of itself,
sufficiently secured in ^Greece^, and needed not to have been guarded with that
caution which may be requisite in other ages. But whether we ascribe the
shifting of sides in all the ^Grecian^ republics to _jealous emulation_ or
_cautious politics_, the effects were alike, and every prevailing power was sure
to meet with a confederacy against it, and that often composed of its former
friends and allies.

{#5,pages=334} The same principle, call it envy or prudence, which produced the
_Ostracism_ of ^Athens^, and _Petalism_ of ^Syracuse^, and expelled every
citizen whose fame or power overtopped the rest; the same principle, I say,
naturally discovered itself in foreign politics, and soon raised enemies to the
leading state, however moderate in the exercise of its authority.

{#6,pages=334-5} The ^Persian^ monarch was really, in his force, a petty prince,
compared to the ^Grecian^ republics; and therefore it behoved him, from views of
safety more than from emulation, to interest himself in their quarrels, and to
support the weaker side in every contest. This was the advice given by
^Alcibiades^ to ^Tissaphernes^[n4], and it prolonged near a century |the date of
the ^Persian^ empire; till the neglect of it for a moment, after the first
appearance of the aspiring genius of ^Philip^, brought that lofty and frail
edifice to the ground, with a rapidity of which there are few instances in the
history of mankind.

{#7,pages=335} The successors of ^Alexander^ showed great jealousy of the
balance of power; a jealousy founded on true politics and prudence, and which
preserved distinct for several ages the partition made after the death of that
famous conqueror. The fortune and ambition of ^Antigonus^[n5] threatened them
anew with a universal monarchy; but their combination, and their victory at
^Ipsus^ saved them. And in subsequent times, we find, that, as the Eastern
princes considered the ^Greeks^ and ^Macedonians^ as the only real military
force, with whom they had any intercourse, they kept always a watchful eye over
that part of the world. The ^Ptolemies^, in particular, supported first ^Aratus^
and the ^Achaeans^, and then ^Cleomenes^ king of ^Sparta^, from no other view
than as a counterbalance to the ^Macedonian^ monarchs. For this is the account
which ^Polybius^ gives of the ^Egyptian^ politics[n6].

{#8,pages=335-6} The reason, why it is supposed, that the ancients were entirely
ignorant of the _balance of power_, seems to be drawn from the ^Roman^ history
more than the ^Grecian^; and as the transactions of the former are generally
more familiar to us, we have thence formed all our conclusions. It must be
owned, that the ^Romans^ never met with any such general combination or
confederacy against them, as might naturally have been expected from the rapid
conquests and declared ambition; but |were allowed peaceably to subdue their
neighbours, one after another, till they extended their dominion over the whole
known world. Not to mention the fabulous history of their ^Italic^ wars; there
was, upon ^Hannibal^'s invasion of the ^Roman^ state, a remarkable crisis, which
ought to have called up the attention of all civilized nations. It appeared
afterwards (nor was it difficult to be observed at the time)[n7] that this was a
contest for universal empire; yet no prince or state seems to have been in the
least alarmed about the event or issue of the quarrel. ^Philip^ of ^Macedon^
remained neuter, till he saw the victories of ^Hannibal^; and then most
imprudently formed an alliance with the conqueror, upon terms still more
imprudent. He stipulated, that he was to assist the ^Carthaginian^ state in
their conquest of ^Italy^; after which they engaged to send over forces into
^Greece^, to assist him in subduing the ^Grecian^ commonwealths[n8].

{#9,pages=336} The ^Rhodian^ and ^Achaean^ republics are much celebrated by
ancient historians for their wisdom and sound policy; yet both of them assisted
the ^Romans^ in their wars against ^Philip^ and ^Antiochus^. And what may be
esteemed still a stronger proof, that this maxim was not generally known in
those ages; no ancient author has remarked the imprudence of these measures, nor
has even blamed that absurd treaty above-mentioned, made by ^Philip^ with the
^Carthaginians^. Princes and statesmen, in all ages, may, before-hand, be
blinded in their reasonings with regard to events: But it is somewhat
extraordinary, that historians, afterwards, should not form a sounder judgment
of them.

{#10,pages=336-7} ^Massinissa^, ^Attalus^, ^Prusias^, in gratifying their
private passions, were, all of them, the instruments of the |^Roman^ greatness;
and never seem to have suspected, that they were forging their own chains, while
they advanced the conquests of their ally. A simple treaty and agreement between
^Massinissa^ and the ^Carthaginians^, so much required by mutual interest,
barred the ^Romans^ from all entrance into ^Africa^, and preserved liberty to
mankind.

{#11,pages=337} The only prince we meet with in the ^Roman^ history, who seems
to have understood the balance of power, is ^Hiero^ king of ^Syracuse^. Though
the ally of ^Rome^, he sent assistance to the ^Carthaginians^, during the war of
the auxiliaries; “Esteeming it requisite,” says ^Polybius^[n9], “both in order
to retain his dominions in ^Sicily^, and to preserve the ^Roman^ friendship,
that ^Carthage^ should be safe; lest by its fall the remaining power should be
able, without contrast or opposition, to execute every purpose and undertaking.
And here he acted with great wisdom and prudence. For that is never, on any
account, to be overlooked; nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into one
hand, as to incapacitate the neighbouring states from defending their rights
against it.” Here is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms.

{#12,pages=337-8} In short, the maxim of preserving the balance of power is
founded so much on common sense and obvious reasoning, that it is impossible it
could altogether have escaped antiquity, where we find, in other particulars, so
many marks of deep |penetration and discernment. If it was not so generally
known and acknowledged as at present, it had, at least, an influence on all the
wiser and more experienced princes and politicians. And indeed, even at present,
however generally known and acknowledged among speculative reasoners, it has
not, in practice, an authority much more extensive among those who govern the
world.

{#13,pages=338} After the fall of the ^Roman^ empire, the form of government,
established by the northern conquerors, incapacitated them, in a great measure,
for farther conquests, and long maintained each state in its proper boundaries.
But when vassalage and the feudal militia were abolished, mankind were anew
alarmed by the danger of universal monarchy, from the union of so many kingdoms
and principalities in the person of the emperor ^Charles^. But the power of the
house of ^Austria^, founded on extensive but divided dominions, and their
riches, derived chiefly from mines of gold and silver, were more likely to
decay, of themselves, from internal defects, than to overthrow all the bulwarks
raised against them. In less than a century, the force of that violent and
haughty race was shattered, their opulence dissipated, their splendor eclipsed.
A new power succeeded, more formidable to the liberties of ^Europe^, possessing
all the advantages of the former, and labouring under none of its defects;
except a share of that spirit of bigotry and persecution, with which the house
of ^Austria^ was so long, and still is so much infatuated.

{#14,pages=338-9} In the general wars, maintained against this ambitious power,
^Great Britain^ has stood foremost; and she still maintains her station. Beside
her advantages of riches and situation, her people are animated with such a
national spirit, and are so fully sensible of the blessings of their government,
that we may hope their vigour never will languish in so necessary and so just a
cause. On the contrary, if we may judge by the past, their passionate ardour
seems rather to require some |moderation; and they have oftener erred from a
laudable excess than from a blameable deficiency.

{#15,pages=339} In the _first_ place, we seem to have been more possessed with
the ancient ^Greek^ spirit of jealous emulation, than actuated by the prudent
views of modern politics. Our wars with ^France^ have been begun with justice,
and even, perhaps, from necessity; but have always been too far pushed from
obstinacy and passion. The same peace, which was afterwards made at ^Ryswick^ in
1697, was offered so early as the year ninety-two; that concluded at ^Utrecht^
in 1712 might have been finished on as good conditions at ^Gertruytenberg^ in
the year eight; and we might have given at ^Frankfort^, in 1743, the same terms,
which we were glad to accept of at ^Aix-la-Chapelle^ in the year forty-eight.
Here then we see, that above half of our wars with ^France^, and all our public
debts, are owing more to our own imprudent vehemence, than to the ambition of
our neighbours.

{#16,pages=339} In the _second_ place, we are so declared in our opposition to
^French^ power, and so alert in defence of our allies, that they always reckon
upon our force as upon their own; and expecting to carry on war at our expence,
refuse all reasonable terms of accommodation. _Habent subjectos, tanquam suos;
viles, ut alienos._ All the world knows, that the factious vote of the House of
Commons, in the beginning of the last parliament, with the professed humour of
the nation, made the queen of ^Hungary^ inflexible in her terms, and prevented
that agreement with ^Prussia^, which would immediately have restored the general
tranquillity of ^Europe^.

{#17,pages=340} In the _third_ place, we are such true combatants, that, when
once engaged, we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity, and consider
only how we may best annoy the enemy. To mortgage our revenues at so deep a
rate, in wars, where we were only accessories, was surely the most fatal
delusion, that a nation, which had any pretension to politics and prudence, has
ever yet been guilty of. That remedy of funding, if it be a remedy, and not
rather a poison, ought, in all reason, to be reserved to the last extremity; and
no evil, but the greatest and most urgent, should ever induce us to embrace so
dangerous an expedient.

{#18,pages=340} These excesses, to which we have been carried, are prejudicial;
and may, perhaps, in time, become still more prejudicial another way, by
begetting, as is usual, the opposite extreme, and rendering us totally careless
and supine with regard to the fate of ^Europe^. The ^Athenians^, from the most
bustling, intriguing, warlike people of ^Greece^, finding their error in
thrusting themselves into every quarrel, abandoned all attention to foreign
affairs; and in no contest ever took part on either side, except by their
flatteries and complaisance to the victor.

{#19,pages=340-1} Enormous monarchies are, probably, destructive to hu|man
nature; in their progress, in their continuance[n10], and even in their downfal,
which never can be very distant from their establishment. The military genius,
which aggrandized the monarchy, soon leaves the court, the capital, and the
center of such a government; while the wars are carried on at a great distance,
and interest so small a part of the state. The ancient nobility, whose
affections attach them to their sovereign, live all at court; and never will
accept of military employments, which would carry them to remote and barbarous
frontiers, where they are distant both from their pleasures and their fortune.
The arms of the state, must, therefore, be entrusted to mercenary strangers,
without zeal, without attachment, without honour; ready on every occasion to
turn them against the prince, and join each desperate malcontent, who offers pay
and plunder. This is the necessary progress of human affairs: Thus human nature
checks itself in its airy elevation: Thus ambition blindly labours for the
destruction of the conqueror, of his family, and of every thing near and dear to
him. The ^Bourbons^, trusting to the support of their brave, faithful, and
affectionate nobility, would push their advantage, without reserve or
limitation. These, while fired with glory and emulation, can bear the fatigues
and dangers of war; but never would submit to languish in the garrisons of
^Hungary^ or ^Lithuania^, forgot at court, and sacrificed to the intrigues of
every minion or mistress, who approaches the prince. The troops are filled with
^Cravates^ and ^Tartars^, ^Hussars^ and ^Cossacs^; intermingled, perhaps, with a
few soldiers of fortune from the better provinces: And the melancholy fate of
the ^Roman^ emperors, from the same cause, is renewed over and over again, till
the final dissolution of the monarchy.
