£1 Of ^Money^. £1

{#1,pages=281-2} MONEY is not, properly speaking, one of the subjects of
commerce; but only the instrument which men have agreed upon to facilitate the
exchange of one commodity for another. It is none of the wheels of trade: It is
the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy. If we
consider any one kingdom by itself, it is evident, that the greater or less
plenty of money is of no consequence; since the prices of commodities are always
proportioned to the plenty of money, and a crown in ^Harry^ VII.'s time served
the same purpose as a pound does at present. It is only the _public_ which
|draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money; and that only in its wars
and negociations with foreign states. And this is the reason, why all rich and
trading countries from ^Carthage^ to ^Great Britain^ and ^Holland^, have
employed mercenary troops, which they hired from their poorer neighbours. Were
they to make use of their native subjects, they would find less advantage from
their superior riches, and from their great plenty of gold and silver; since the
pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence. Our
small army of 20,000 men is maintained at as great expence as a ^French^ army
twice as numerous. The ^English^ fleet, during the late war, required as much
money to support it as all the ^Roman^ legions, which kept the whole world in
subjection, during the time of the emperors[n1].

{#2,pages=283} The greater number of people and their greater industry are
serviceable in all cases; at home and abroad, in private, and in public. But the
greater plenty of money, is very limited in its use, and may even sometimes be a
loss to a nation in its commerce with foreigners.

{#3,pages=283-4} There seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human
affairs, which checks the growth of trade and riches, and hinders them from
being confined entirely to one people; as might naturally at first be dreaded
from the advantages of an established commerce. Where one nation has gotten the
start of another in trade, it is very difficult for the latter to regain the
ground it has lost; because of the superior industry and skill of the former,
and the greater stocks, of which its merchants are possessed, and which enable
them to trade on so much smaller profits. But these advantages are compensated,
in some measure, by the low price of labour in every nation which has not an
extensive commerce, and does not much abound in gold and silver. Manufactures,
therefore{++,++} gradually shift their places, leaving those countries and
provinces which they have already enriched, and flying to others, whither they
are allured by the cheapness of provisions and labour; till they have enriched
these also, and are again banished by the same |causes. And, in general, we may
observe, that the dearness of every thing, from plenty of money, is a
disadvantage, which attends an established commerce, and sets bounds to it in
every country, by enabling the poorer states to undersel the richer in all
foreign markets.

{#4,pages=284-5} This has made me entertain a doubt concerning the benefit of
_banks_ and _paper-credit_, which are so generally esteemed advantageous to
every nation. That provisions and labour should become dear by the encrease of
trade and money, is, in many respects, an inconvenience; but an inconvenience
that is unavoidable, and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity which
are the end of all our wishes. It is compensated by the advantages, which we
reap from the possession of these precious metals, and the weight, which they
give the nation in all foreign wars and negociations. But there appears no
reason for encreasing that inconvenience by a counterfeit money, which
foreigners will not accept of in any payment, and which any great disorder in
the state will reduce to nothing. There are, it is true, many people in every
rich state, who{++,++} having large sums of money, would prefer paper with good
security; as being of more easy transport and more safe custody. If the public
provide not a bank, private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance; as
the goldsmiths formerly did in ^London^, or as the bankers do at present in
^Dublin^: And therefore it is better, it may be thought, that a public company
should enjoy the benefit of that paper-credit, which always will have place in
every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour artificially to encrease such a credit,
can never be the interest of any trading nation; but must lay them under
disadvantages, by encreasing money beyond its natural proportion to labour and
commodities, and thereby heightening their price to the merchant and
manufacturer. And in this view, it must be allowed, that no bank could be more
advantageous, than such a one as locked up all the money it received[n2], and
never augmented the circulating coin, as is usual, |by returning part of its
treasure into commerce. A public bank, by this expedient, might cut off much of
the dealings of private bankers and money-jobbers; and though the state bore the
charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank (for, according to
the preceding supposition, it would have no profit from its dealings), the
national advantage, resulting from the low price of labour and the destruction
of paper-credit, would be a sufficient compensation. Not to mention, that so
large a sum, lying ready at command, would be a convenience in times of great
public danger and distress; and what part of it was used might be replaced at
leisure, when peace and tranquillity was restored to the nation.

{#5,pages=285} But of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely
hereafter. And I shall finish this essay on money, by proposing and explaining
two observations, which may, perhaps, serve to employ the thoughts of our
speculative politicians.

{#6,pages=285-6} It was a shrewd observation of ^Anacharsis^[n3] the ^Scythian^,
who had never seen money in his own country, that gold and silver seemed to him
of no use to the ^Greeks^, but to assist them in numeration and arithmetic. It
is indeed evident, that money is nothing but the representation of labour and
commodities, and serves only as a method of rating or estimating them. Where
coin is in greater plenty; as a greater quantity of it is required to represent
the same quantity of goods; it can have no effect, either good or bad, taking a
nation within itself; any more than it would make an alteration on a merchant's
books, if, instead of the ^Arabian^ method of notation, which requires few
characters, he should make use of the ^Roman^, which requires a great many. Nay,
the greater quantity of money, like the ^Roman^ characters, is rather
inconvenient, and requires greater trouble both to keep and transport it. But
notwithstanding this conclusion, which must be |allowed just, it is certain,
that, since the discovery of the mines in ^America^, industry has encreased in
all the nations of ^Europe^, except in the possessors of those mines; and this
may justly be ascribed, amongst other reasons, to the encrease of gold and
silver. Accordingly we find, that, in every kingdom, into which money begins to
flow in greater abundance than formerly, every thing takes a new face: labour
and industry gain life; the merchant becomes more enterprising, the manufacturer
more diligent and skilful, and even the farmer follows his plough with greater
alacrity and attention. This is not easily to be accounted for, if we consider
only the influence which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself,
by heightening the price of commodities, and obliging every one to pay a greater
number of these little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases. And
as to foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty of money is rather
disadvantageous, by raising the price of every kind of labour.

{#7,pages=286-7} To account, then, for this phenomenon, we must consider, that
though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the encrease
of gold and silver, yet it follows not immediately upon that encrease; but some
time is required before the money circulates through the whole state, and makes
its effect be felt on all ranks of people. At first, no alteration is perceived;
by degrees the price rises, first of one commodity, then of another; till the
whole at last reaches a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which is
in the kingdom. In my opinion, it is only in this interval or intermediate
situation, between the acquisition of money and rise of prices, that the
encreasing quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry. When any
quantity of money is imported into a nation, it is not at first dispersed into
many hands; but is confined to the coffers of a few persons, who immediately
seek to employ it to advantage. Here are a set of manufacturers or merchants, we
shall suppose, who have received returns of gold and silver for goods which they
sent to ^Cadiz^. They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen |than formerly,
who never dream of demanding higher wages, but are glad of employment from such
good paymasters. If workmen become scarce, the manufacturer gives higher wages,
but at first requires an encrease of labour; and this is willingly submitted to
by the artisan, who can now eat and drink better, to compensate his additional
toil and fatigue. He carries his money to market, where he finds every thing at
the same price as formerly, but returns with greater quantity and of better
kinds, for the use of his family. The farmer and gardener, finding, that all
their commodities are taken off, apply themselves with alacrity to the raising
more; and at the same time can afford to take better and more cloths from their
tradesmen, whose price is the same as formerly, and their industry only whetted
by so much new gain. It is easy to trace the money in its progress through the
whole commonwealth; where we shall find, that it must first quicken the
diligence of every individual, before it encrease the price of labour.

{#8,pages=287} And that the specie may encrease to a considerable pitch, before
it have this latter effect, appears, amongst other instances, from the frequent
operations of the ^French^ king on the money; where it was always found, that
the augmenting of the numerary value did not produce a proportional rise of the
prices, at least for some time. In the last year of ^Louis^ XIV. money was
raised three-sevenths, but prices augmented only one. Corn in ^France^ is now
sold at the same price, or for the same number of livres, it was in 1683; though
silver was then at 30 livres the mark, and is now at 50[n4]. Not to mention the
great addition of gold and silver, which may have come into that kingdom since
the former period.

{#9,pages=288-9} From the whole of this reasoning we may conclude, that it is of
no manner of consequence, with regard to the domestic happiness of a state,
whether money be in a greater or less quantity. The good policy of the
magistrate consists only in keeping it, if possible, still encreasing; because,
by that means, he keeps alive a spirit of industry in the nation, and encreases
the stock of labour, in which consists all real power and riches. A nation,
whose money decreases, is actually, at that time, weaker and more miserable than
another nation, which possesses no more money, but is on the encreasing hand.
This will be easily accounted for, if we consider, that the alterations in the
quantity of money, either on one side or the other, are not immediately attended
with proportionable alterations in the price of commodities. There is always an
interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation; and this interval is
as pernicious to industry, when gold and silver are diminishing, as it is
advantageous when these metals are encreasing. The workman has not the same
employment from the manufacturer and merchant; though he pays the same price for
every thing in the market. The farmer cannot dispose |of his corn and cattle;
though he must pay the same rent to his landlord. The poverty, and beggary, and
sloth, which must ensue, are easily foreseen.

{#10,pages=289-90} II. The second observation which I proposed to make with
regard to money, may be explained after the following manner. There are some
kingdoms, and many provinces in ^Europe^, (and all of them were once in the same
condition) where money is so scarce, that the landlord can get none at all from
his tenants; but is obliged to take his rent in kind, and either to consume it
himself, or transport it to places where he may find a market. In those
countries, the prince can levy few or no taxes, but in the same manner: And as
he will receive small benefit from impositions so paid, it is evident that such
a kingdom has little force even at home; and cannot maintain fleets and armies
to the same extent, as if every part of it abounded in gold and silver. There is
surely a greater disproportion between the force of ^Germany^, at present, and
what it was three centuries ago[n5], than there is in its industry, people, and
manufactures. The ^Austrian^ dominions in the empire are in general well peopled
and well cultivated, and are of great extent; but have not a proportionable
weight in the balance of ^Europe^; proceeding, as is commonly supposed, from the
scarcity of money. How do all these facts agree with that principle of reason,
that the quantity of gold and silver is in itself altogether indifferent?
According to that principle{++,++} wherever a sovereign has numbers of subjects,
and these have plenty of commodities, he should of course be great and powerful,
and they rich and happy, independent of the greater or |lesser abundance of the
precious metals. These admit of divisions and subdivisions to a great extent;
and where the pieces might become so small as to be in danger of being lost, it
is easy to mix the gold or silver with a baser metal, as is practised in some
countries of ^Europe^; and by that means raise the pieces to a bulk more
sensible and convenient. They still serve the same purposes of exchange,
whatever their number may be, or whatever colour they may be supposed to have.

{#11,pages=290} To these difficulties I answer, that the effect, here supposed
to flow from scarcity of money, really arises from the manners and customs of
the people; and that we mistake, as is too usual, a collateral effect for a
cause. The contradiction is only apparent; but it requires some thought and
reflection to discover the principles, by which we can reconcile _reason_ to
_experience_.

{#12,pages=290} It seems a maxim almost self-evident, that the prices of every
thing depend on the proportion between commodities and money, and that any
considerable alteration on either has the same effect, either of heightening or
lowering the price. Encrease the commodities, they become cheaper; encrease the
money, they rise in their value. As, on the other hand, a diminution of the
former, and that of the latter, have contrary tendencies.

{#13,pages=290} It is also evident, that the prices do not so much depend on the
absolute quantity of commodities and that of money, which are in a nation, as on
that of the commodities, which come or may come to market, and of the money
which circulates. If the coin be locked up in chests, it is the same thing with
regard to prices, as if it were annihilated; if the commodities be hoarded in
magazines and granaries, a like effect follows. As the money and commodities, in
these cases, never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were we, at any time, to
form conjectures concerning the price of provisions, the corn, which the farmer
must reserve for seed and for the maintenance of himself and family, ought never
to enter into the estimation. It is only the overplus, compared to the demand,
that determines the value.

{#14,pages=290-1} To apply these principles, we must consider, that, in the
|first and more uncultivated ages of any state, ere fancy has confounded her
wants with those of nature, men, content with the produce of their own fields,
or with those rude improvements which they themselves can work upon them, have
little occasion for exchange, at least for money, which, by agreement, is the
common measure of exchange. The wool of the farmer's own flock, spun in his own
family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who receives his payment in corn
or wool, suffices for furniture and cloathing. The carpenter, the smith, the
mason, the tailor, are retained by wages of a like nature; and the landlord
himself, dwelling in the neighbourhood, is content to receive his rent in the
commodities raised by the farmer. The greater part of these he consumes at home,
in rustic hospitality: The rest, perhaps, he disposes of for money to the
neighbouring town, whence he draws the few materials of his expence and luxury.

{#15,pages=291} But after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments, and live
not always at home, nor are content with what can be raised in their
neighbourhood, there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds, and more money
enters into that exchange. The tradesmen will not be paid in corn; because they
want something more than barely to eat. The farmer goes beyond his own parish
for the commodities he purchases, and cannot always carry his commodities to the
merchant who supplies him. The landlord lives in the capital, or in a foreign
country; and demands his rent in gold and silver, which can easily be
transported to him. Great undertakers, and manufacturers, and merchants, arise
in every commodity; and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie.
And consequently, in this situation of society, the coin enters into many more
contracts, and by that means is much more employed than in the former.

{#16,pages=291-2} The necessary effect is, that, provided the money encrease not
in the nation, every thing must become much cheaper in times of industry and
refinement, than in rude, uncultivated ages. It is the proportion between the
circulating money, and the commodities in the market, which determines the
prices. Goods, that are consumed at home, or exchanged |with other goods in the
neighbourhood, never come to market; they affect not in the least the current
specie; with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated; and consequently
this method of using them sinks the proportion on the side of the commodities,
and encreases the prices. But after money enters into all contracts and sales,
and is every where the measure of exchange, the same national cash has a much
greater task to perform; all commodities are then in the market; the sphere of
circulation is enlarged; it is the same case as if that individual sum were to
serve a larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion being here lessened on the
side of the money, every thing must become cheaper, and the prices gradually
fall.

{#17,pages=292-3} By the most exact computations, that have been formed all over
^Europe^, after making allowance for the alteration in the numerary value or the
denomination, it is found, that the prices of all things have only risen three,
or at most, four times, since the discovery of the ^West Indies^. But will any
one assert, that there is not much more than four times the coin in ^Europe^,
that was in the fifteenth century, and the centuries preceding it? The
^Spaniards^ and ^Portuguese^ from their mines, the ^English^, ^French^, and
^Dutch^, by their ^African^ trade, and by their interlopers in the ^West
Indies^, bring home about six millions a year, of which not above a third goes
to the {~~^East-Indies^->^East Indies^~~}. This sum alone, in ten years, would
probably double the ancient stock of money in ^Europe^. And no other
satisfactory reason can be given, why all prices have not risen to a much more
exorbitant height, except that which is derived from a change of customs and
manners. Besides that more commodities are produced by additional industry, the
same commodities come more to market, after men depart from their ancient
simplicity of manners. |And though this encrease has not been equal to that of
money, it has, however, been considerable, and has preserved the proportion
between coin and commodities nearer the ancient standard.

{#18,pages=293} Were the question proposed, Which of these methods of living in
the people, the simple or refined, is the most advantageous to the state or
public? I should, without much scruple, prefer the latter, in a view to politics
at least; and should produce this as an additional reason for the encouragement
of trade and manufactures.

{#19,pages=293} While men live in the ancient simple manner, and supply all
their necessaries from domestic industry or from the neighbourhood, the
sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part of his subjects;
and if he will impose on them any burthens, he must take payment in commodities,
with which alone they abound; a method attended with such great and obvious
inconveniencies, that they need not here be insisted on. All the money he can
pretend to raise, must be from his principal cities, where alone it circulates;
and these, it is evident, cannot afford him so much as the whole state could,
did gold and silver circulate throughout the whole. But besides this obvious
diminution of the revenue, there is another cause of the poverty of the public
in such a situation. Not only the sovereign receives less money, but the same
money goes not so far as in times of industry and general commerce. Every thing
is dearer, where the gold and silver are supposed equal; and that because fewer
commodities come to market, and the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what
is to be purchased by it; whence alone the prices of every thing are fixed and
determined.

{#20,pages=293-4} Here then we may learn the fallacy of the remark, often to be
met with in historians, and even in common conversation, that any particular
state is weak, though fertile, populous, and well cultivated, merely because it
wants money. It appears, that the want of money can never injure any state
within itself: For men and commodities are the real strength of any community.
It is the simple manner of living which here hurts the public, by confining the
gold and silver to few hands, and |preventing its universal diffusion and
circulation. On the contrary, industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate
it with the whole state, however small its quantity may be: They digest it into
every vein, so to speak; and make it enter into every transaction and contract.
No hand is entirely empty of it. And as the prices of every thing fall by that
means, the sovereign has a double advantage: He may draw money by his taxes from
every part of the state; and what he receives, goes farther in every purchase
and payment.

{#21,pages=294} We may infer, from a comparison of prices, that money is not
more plentiful in ^China^, than it was in ^Europe^ three centuries ago: But what
immense power is that empire possessed of, if we may judge by the civil and
military establishment maintained by it? ^Polybius^[n6] tells us, that
provisions were so cheap in ^Italy^ during his time, that in some places the
stated price for a meal at the inns was a _semis_ a head, little more than a
farthing! Yet the ^Roman^ power had even then subdued the whole known world.
About a century before that period, the ^Carthaginian^ ambassador said, by way
of raillery, that no people lived more sociably amongst themselves than the
^Romans^; for that, in every entertainment, which, as foreign ministers, they
received, they still observed the same plate at every table[n7]. The absolute
quantity of the precious metals is a matter of great indifference. There are
only two circumstances of any importance, namely, their gradual encrease, and
their thorough concoction and circulation through the state; and the influence
of both these circumstances has here been explained.

{#22,pages=294} In the following Essay we shall see an instance of a like
fallacy as that above mentioned; where a collateral effect is taken for a cause,
and where a consequence is ascribed to the plenty of money; though it be really
owing to a change in the manners and customs of the people.

{#n1} See NOTE [P].

{#n1.1,pages=282-3} A Private soldier in the ^Roman^ infantry had a denarius a
day, somewhat less than eightpence. The ^Roman^ emperors had commonly 25 legions
in pay, which allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000. ^Tacit.^ _Ann._ lib.
iv. It is true, there were also auxiliaries to the legions; but their |numbers
are uncertain, as well as their pay. To consider only the legionaries, the pay
of the private men could not exceed 1,600,000 pounds. Now, the parliament in the
last war commonly allowed for the fleet 2,500,000. We have therefore 900,000
over for the officers and other expences of the ^Roman^ legions. There seem to
have been but few officers in the ^Roman^ armies, in comparison of what are
employed in all our modern troops, except some ^Swiss^ corps. And these officers
had very small pay: A centurion, for instance, only double a common soldier. And
as the soldiers from their pay (^Tacit.^ _Ann._ lib. i.) bought their own
cloaths, arms, tents, and baggage; this must also diminish considerably the
other charges of the army. So little expensive was that mighty government, and
so easy was its yoke over the world. And, indeed, this is the more natural
conclusion from the foregoing calculations. For money, after the conquest of
^{AE}gypt^, seems to have been nearly in as great plenty at ^Rome^, as it is at
present in the richest of the ^European^ kingdoms.

{#n2,pages=284} This is the case with the bank of ^Amsterdam^.

{#n3,pages=285} ^Plut.^ _Quomodo quis suos profectus in virtute sentire possit._

{#n4} See NOTE [Q].

{#n4.1,pages=287} THESE facts I give upon the authority of Mons. du ^Tot^ in his
_Reflections politiques_, an author of reputation. Though I must confess, that
the facts which he advances on other occasions, are often so suspicious, as to
make his authority less in this matter. However, the general observation, that
the augmenting of the money in ^France^ does not at first proportionably augment
the prices, is certainly just.

{#n4.2,pages=287-8} By the by, this seems to be one of the best reasons which
can be given, for a gradual and universal encrease of the denomination of money,
though |it has been entirely overlooked in all those volumes which have been
written on that question by ^Melon^, Du ^Tot^, and ^Paris^ de ^Verney^. Were all
our money, for instance, recoined, and a penny's worth of silver taken from
every shilling, the new shilling would probably purchase every thing that could
have been bought by the old; the prices of every thing would thereby be
insensibly diminished; foreign trade enlivened; and domestic industry, by the
circulation of a great number of pounds and shillings, would receive some
encrease and encouragement. In executing such a project, it would be better to
make the new shilling pass for 24 halfpence, in order to preserve the illusion,
and make it be taken for the same. And as a recoinage of our silver begins to be
requisite, by the continual wearing of our shillings and sixpences, it may be
doubtful, whether we ought to imitate the example in King ^William^'s reign,
when the clipt money was raised to the old standard.

{#n5,pages=289} The ^Italians^ gave to the Emperor ^Maximilian^, the nickname of
^Pocci-danari^. None of the enterprises of that prince ever succeeded, for want
of money.
