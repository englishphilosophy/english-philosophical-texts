£1 Of ^Superstition^ and ^Enthusiasm^. £1

{#1,pages=73} _THAT the corruption of the best things produces the worst,_ is
grown into a maxim, and is commonly proved, among other instances, by the
pernicious effects of _superstition_ and _enthusiasm_, the corruptions of true
religion.

{#2,pages=73-4} These two species of false religion, though both pernicious, are
yet of a very different, and even of a contrary nature. The mind of man is
subject to certain unaccountable terrors and apprehensions, proceeding either
from the unhappy situation of private or public affairs, from ill health, from a
gloomy and melancholy disposition, or from the concurrence of all these
circumstances. In such a state of mind, infinite unknown evils are dreaded from
unknown agents; and where real objects of terror are wanting, the soul, active
to its |own prejudice, and fostering its predominant inclination, finds
imaginary ones, to whose power and malevolence it sets no limits. As these
enemies are entirely invisible and unknown, the methods taken to appease them
are equally unaccountable, and consist in ceremonies, observances,
mortifications, sacrifices, presents, or in any practice, however absurd or
frivolous, which either folly or knavery recommends to a blind and terrified
credulity. Weakness, fear, melancholy, together with ignorance, are, therefore,
the true sources of ^Superstition^.

{#3,pages=74} But the mind of man is also subject to an unaccountable elevation
and presumption, arising from prosperous success, from luxuriant health, from
strong spirits, or from a bold and confident disposition. In such a state of
mind, the imagination swells with great, but confused conceptions, to which no
sublunary beauties or enjoyments can correspond. Every thing mortal and
perishable vanishes as unworthy of attention. And a full range is given to the
fancy in the invisible regions or world of spirits, where the soul is at liberty
to indulge itself in every imagination, which may best suit its present taste
and disposition. Hence arise raptures, transports, and surprising flights of
fancy; and confidence and presumption still encreasing, these raptures, being
altogether unaccountable, and seeming quite beyond the reach of our ordinary
faculties, are attributed to the immediate inspiration of that Divine Being, who
is the object of devotion. In a little time, the inspired person comes to regard
himself as a distinguished favourite of the Divinity; and when this frenzy once
takes place, which is the summit of enthusiasm, every whimsy is consecrated:
Human reason, and even morality are rejected as fallacious guides: And the
fanatic madman delivers himself over, blindly, and without reserve, to the
supposed illapses of the spirit, and to inspiration from above. Hope, pride,
presumption, a warm imagination, together with ignorance, are, therefore, the
true sources of ^Enthusiasm^.

{#4,pages=74-5} These two species of false religion might afford occasion to
many speculations; but I shall confine myself, at present, to a |few reflections
concerning their different influence on government and society.

{#5,pages=75} My first reflection is, _That superstition is favourable to
priestly power, and enthusiasm not less or rather more contrary to it, than
sound reason and philosophy._ As superstition is founded on fear, sorrow, and a
depression of spirits, it represents the man to himself in such despicable
colours, that he appears unworthy, in his own eyes, of approaching the divine
presence, and naturally has recourse to any other person, whose sanctity of
life, or, perhaps, impudence and cunning, have made him be supposed more
favoured by the Divinity. To him the superstitious entrust their devotions: To
his care they recommend their prayers, petitions, and sacrifices: And by his
means, they hope to render their addresses acceptable to their incensed Deity.
Hence the origin of ^Priests^, who may justly be regarded as an invention of a
timorous and abject superstition, which, ever diffident of itself, dares not
offer up its own devotions, but ignorantly thinks to recommend itself to the
Divinity, by the mediation of his supposed friends and servants. As superstition
is a considerable ingredient in almost all religions, even the most fanatical;
there being nothing but philosophy able entirely to conquer these unaccountable
terrors; hence it proceeds, that in almost every sect of religion there are
priests to be found: But the stronger mixture there is of superstition, the
higher is the authority of the priesthood.

{#6,pages=75-6} On the other hand, it may be observed, that all enthusiasts have
been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics, and have expressed great independence
in their devotion; with a contempt of forms, ceremonies, and traditions. The
_quakers_ are the most egregious, though, at the same time, the most inno|cent
enthusiasts that have yet been known; and are, perhaps, the only sect, that have
never admitted priests amongst them. The _independents_, of all the ^English^
sectaries, approach nearest to the _quakers_ in fanaticism, and in their freedom
from priestly bondage. The _presbyterians_ follow after, at an equal distance in
both particulars. In short this observation is founded in experience; and will
also appear to be founded in reason, if we consider, that, as enthusiasm arises
from a presumptuous pride and confidence, it thinks itself sufficiently
qualified to _approach_ the Divinity, without any human mediator. Its rapturous
devotions are so fervent, that it even imagines itself _actually_ to _approach_
him by the way of contemplation and inward converse; which makes it neglect all
those outward ceremonies and observances, to which the assistance of the priests
appears so requisite in the eyes of their superstitious votaries. The fanatic
consecrates himself, and bestows on his own person a sacred character, much
superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions can confer on any other.

{#7,pages=76-7} My _second_ reflection with regard to these species of false
religion is, _that religions, which partake of enthusiasm are, on their first
rise, more furious and violent than those which partake of superstition; but in
a little time become more gentle and moderate._ The violence of this species of
religion, when excited by novelty, and animated by opposition, appears from
number|less instances; of the _anabaptists_ in ^Germany^, the _camisars_ in
^France^, the _levellers_ and other fanatics in ^England^, and the _covenanters_
in ^Scotland^. Enthusiasm being founded on strong spirits, and a presumptuous
boldness of character, it naturally begets the most extreme resolutions;
especially after it rises to that height as to inspire the deluded fanatic with
the opinion of divine illuminations, and with a contempt for the common rules of
reason, morality, and prudence.

{#8,pages=77-8} It is thus enthusiasm produces the most cruel disorders in human
society; but its fury is like that of thunder and tempest, which exhaust
themselves in a little time, and leave the air more calm and serene than before.
When the first fire of enthusiasm is spent, men naturally, in all fanatical
sects, sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters; there
being no body of men among them, endowed with sufficient authority, whose
interest is concerned to support the |religious spirit: No rites, no ceremonies,
no holy observances, which may enter into the common train of life, and preserve
the sacred principles from oblivion. Superstition, on the contrary, steals in
gradually and insensibly; renders men tame and submissive; is acceptable to the
magistrate, and seems inoffensive to the people: Till at last the priest, having
firmly established his authority, becomes the tyrant and disturber of human
society, by his endless contentions, persecutions, and religious wars. How
smoothly did the ^Romish^ church advance in her acquisition of power? But into
what dismal convulsions did she throw all ^Europe^, in order to maintain it? On
the other hand, our sectaries, who were formerly such dangerous bigots, are now
become very free reasoners; and the _quakers_ seem to approach nearly the only
regular body of _deists_ in the universe, the _literati_, or the disciples of
^Confucius^ in ^China^[n1].

{#9,pages=78-9} My _third_ observation on this head is, _that superstition is an
enemy to civil liberty, and enthusiasm a friend to it._ As superstition groans
under the dominion of priests, and enthusiasm is destructive of all
ecclesiastical power, this sufficiently accounts for the present observation.
Not to mention, that enthusiasm, being the infirmity of bold and ambitious
tempers, is naturally accompanied with a spirit of liberty; as superstition, on
the contrary, renders men tame and abject, and fits them for slavery. We learn
from ^English^ history, that, during the civil wars, the _independents_ and
_deists_, though the most opposite in their religious principles; yet were
united in their |political ones, and were alike passionate for a commonwealth.
And since the origin of _whig_ and _tory_, the leaders of the _whigs_ have
either been _deists_ or profest _latitudinarians_ in their principles; that is,
friends to toleration, and indifferent to any particular sect of _christians:_
While the sectaries, who have all a strong tincture of enthusiasm, have always,
without exception, concurred with that party, in defence of civil liberty. The
resemblance in their superstitions long united the high-church _tories_, and the
_Roman catholics_, in support of prerogative and kingly power; though experience
of the tolerating spirit of the _whigs_ seems of late to have reconciled the
_catholics_ to that party.

{#10,pages=79} The _molinists_ and _jansenists_ in ^France^ have a thousand
unintelligible disputes, which are not worthy the reflection of a man of sense:
But what principally distinguishes these two sects, and alone merits attention,
is the different spirit of their religion. The _molinists_ conducted by the
_jesuits_, are great friends to superstition, rigid observers of external forms
and ceremonies, and devoted to the authority of the priests, and to tradition.
The _jansenists_ are enthusiasts, and zealous promoters of the passionate
devotion, and of the inward life; little influenced by authority; and, in a
word, but half catholics. The consequences are exactly conformable to the
foregoing reasoning. The _jesuits_ are the tyrants of the people, and the slaves
of the court: And the _jansenists_ preserve alive the small sparks of the love
of liberty, which are to be found in the ^French^ nation.

{#n1,pages=78} The ^Chinese^ Literati have no priests or ecclesiastical
establishment.
