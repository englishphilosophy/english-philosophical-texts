£1 That ^Politics^ may be reduced to a ^Science^. £1

{#1,pages=14-5} IT is a question with several, whether there be any essential
difference between one form of government and another? and, whether every form
may not become good or bad, according as it is well or ill administered[n1]?
Were it once admitted, that all governments are alike, and that the only
difference consists in the character and conduct of the governors, most
political disputes would be at an end, and all _Zeal_ for one |constitution
above another, must be esteemed mere bigotry and folly. But, though a friend to
moderation, I cannot forbear condemning this sentiment, and should be sorry to
think, that human affairs admit of no greater stability, than what they receive
from the casual humours and characters of particular men.

{#2,pages=15} It is true; those who maintain, that the goodness of all
government consists in the goodness of the administration, may cite many
particular instances in history, where the very same government, in different
hands, has varied suddenly into the two opposite extremes of good and bad.
Compare the ^French^ government under ^Henry^ III. and under ^Henry^ IV.
Oppression, levity, artifice on the part of the rulers; faction, sedition,
treachery, rebellion, disloyalty on the part of the subjects: These compose the
character of the former miserable {ae}ra. But when the patriot and heroic
prince, who succeeded, was once firmly seated on the throne, the government, the
people, every thing seemed to be totally changed; and all from the difference of
the temper and conduct of these two sovereigns. Instances of this kind may be
multiplied, almost without number, from ancient as well as modern history,
foreign as well as domestic.

{#3,pages=15-6} But here it may be proper to make a distinction. All absolute
governments must very much depend on the administration; and this is one of the
great inconveniences attending that form of government. But a republican and
free government would be an obvious absurdity, if the particular checks and
controuls, provided by the constitution, had really no |influence, and made it
not the interest, even of bad men, to act for the public good. Such is the
intention of these forms of government, and such is their real effect, where
they are wisely constituted: As on the other hand, they are the source of all
disorder, and of the blackest crimes, where either skill or honesty has been
wanting in their original frame and institution.

{#4,pages=16} So great is the force of laws, and of particular forms of
government, and so little dependence have they on the humours and tempers of
men, that consequences almost as general and certain may sometimes be deduced
from them, as any which the mathematical sciences afford us.

{#5,pages=16} The constitution of the ^Roman^ republic gave the whole
legislative power to the people, without allowing a negative voice either to the
nobility or consuls. This unbounded power they possessed in a collective, not in
a representative body. The consequences were: When the people, by success and
conquest, had become very numerous, and had spread themselves to a great
distance from the capital, the city-tribes, though the most contemptible,
carried almost every vote: They were, therefore, most cajoled by every one that
affected popularity: They were supported in idleness by the general distribution
of corn, and by particular bribes, which they received from almost every
candidate: By this means, they became every day more licentious, and the ^Campus
Martius^ was a perpetual scene of tumult and sedition: Armed slaves were
introduced among these rascally citizens; so that the whole government fell into
anarchy, and the greatest happiness, which the ^Romans^ could look for, was the
despotic power of the ^C{ae}sars^. Such are the effects of democracy without a
representative.

{#6,pages=16-7} A Nobility may possess the whole, or any part of the legislative
power of a state, in two different ways. Either every nobleman shares the power
as part of the whole body, or the |whole body enjoys the power as composed of
parts, which have each a distinct power and authority. The ^Venetian^
aristocracy is an instance of the first kind of government: The ^Polish^ of the
second. In the ^Venetian^ government the whole body of nobility possesses the
whole power, and no nobleman has any authority which he receives not from the
whole. In the ^Polish^ government every nobleman, by means of his fiefs, has a
distinct hereditary authority over his vassals, and the whole body has no
authority but what it receives from the concurrence of its parts. The different
operations and tendencies of these two species of government might be made
apparent even _a priori_. A ^Venetian^ nobility is preferable to a ^Polish^, let
the humours and education of men be ever so much varied. A nobility, who possess
their power in common, will preserve peace and order, both among themselves, and
their subjects; and no member can have authority enough to controul the laws for
a moment. The nobles will preserve their authority over the people, but without
any grievous tyranny, or any breach of private property; because such a
tyrannical government promotes not the interests of the whole body, however it
may that of some individuals. There will be a distinction of rank between the
nobility and people, but this will be the only distinction in the state. The
whole nobility will form one body, and the whole people another, without any of
those private feuds and animosities, which spread ruin and desolation every
where. It is easy to see the disadvantages of a ^Polish^ nobility in every one
of these particulars.

{#7,pages=17-8} It is possible so to constitute a free government, as that a
single person, call him doge, prince, or king, shall possess a |large share of
power, and shall form a proper balance or counterpoise to the other parts of the
legislature. This chief magistrate may be either _elective_ or _hereditary_; and
though the former institution may, to a superficial view, appear the most
advantageous; yet a more accurate inspection will discover in it greater
inconveniencies than in the latter, and such as are founded on causes and
principles eternal and immutable. The filling of the throne, in such a
government, is a point of too great and too general interest, not to divide the
whole people into factions: Whence a civil war, the greatest of ills, may be
apprehended, almost with certainty, upon every vacancy. The prince elected must
be either a _Foreigner_ or a _Native:_ The former will be ignorant of the people
whom he is to govern; suspicious of his new subjects, and suspected by them;
giving his confidence entirely to strangers, who will have no other care but of
enriching themselves in the quickest manner, while their master's favour and
authority are able to support them. A native will carry into the throne all his
private animosities and friendships, and will never be viewed in his elevation,
without exciting the sentiment of envy in those, who formerly considered him as
their equal. Not to mention that a crown is too high a reward ever to be given
to merit alone, and will always induce the candidates to employ force, or money,
or intrigue, to procure the votes of the electors: So that such an election will
give no better chance for superior merit in the prince, than if the state had
trusted to birth alone for determining their sovereign.

{#8,pages=18} It may therefore be pronounced as an universal axiom in politics,
_That an hereditary prince, a nobility without vassals, and a people voting by
their representatives, form the best ^Momarchy^, ^Aristocracy^, and
^Democracy^._ But in order to prove more fully, that politics admit of general
truths, which are invariable by the humour or education either of subject or
sovereign, it may not be amiss to observe some other principles of this science,
which may seem to deserve that character.

{#9,pages=18-21} It may easily be observed, that, though free governments have
been commonly the most happy for those who partake of their freedom; yet are
they the most ruinous and oppressive to |their provinces: And this observation
may, I believe, be fixed as a maxim of the kind we are here speaking of. When a
monarch extends his dominions by conquest, he soon learns to consider his old
and his new subjects as on the same footing; because, in reality, all his
subjects are to him the same, except the few friends and favourites, with whom
he is personally acquainted. He does not, therefore, make any distinction
between them in his _general_ laws; and, at the same time, is careful to prevent
all _particular_ acts of oppression on the one as well as on the other. But a
free state necessarily makes a great distinction, and must always do so, till
men learn to love their neighbours as well as themselves. The conquerors, in
such a government, are all legislators, and will be sure to contrive matters, by
restrictions on trade, and by taxes, so as to draw some private, as well as
public, advantage from their conquests. Provincial governors have also a better
chance, in a republic, to escape with their plunder, by means of bribery or
intrigue; and their fellow-citizens, who find their own state to be enriched by
the spoils of the subject provinces, will be the more inclined to tolerate such
abuses. Not to mention, that it is a necessary precaution in a free state to
change the governors frequently; which obliges these temporary tyrants to be
more expeditious and rapacious, that they may accumulate sufficient wealth
before they give place to their successors. What cruel tyrants were the ^Romans^
over the world during the time of their commonwealth! It is true, they had laws
to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates; but ^Cicero^ informs us,
that the ^Romans^ could not better consult the interests of the provinces than
by repealing these very laws. For, in that case, says he, our magistrates,
having entire impunity, would plunder no more than would satisfy their own
rapaciousness; whereas, at present, they must also satisfy that of their judges,
and of all the great men in ^Rome^, of whose protection they stand in need. Who
can read of the cruelties and oppressions of ^Verres^ without horror and
astonishment? |And who is not touched with indignation to hear, that, after
^Cicero^ had exhausted on that abandoned criminal all the thunders of his
eloquence, and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned to the utmost extent
of the laws; yet that cruel tyrant lived peaceably to old age, in opulence and
ease, and, thirty years afterwards, was put into the proscription by ^Mark
Anthony^, on account of his exorbitant wealth, where he fell with ^Cicero^
himself, and all the most virtuous men of ^Rome^? After the dissolution of the
commonwealth, the ^Roman^ yoke became easier upon the provinces, as ^Tacitus^
informs us[n2]; and it may be observed, that many of the worst emperors,
^Domitian^[n3], for instance, were careful to prevent all oppression on the
provinces. In[n4] ^Tiberius^'s time, ^Gaul^ was esteemed richer than ^Italy^
itself: Nor, do I find, during the whole time of the ^Roman^ monarchy, that the
empire became less rich or populous in any of its provinces; though indeed its
valour and military discipline were always upon the |decline. The oppression and
tyranny of the ^Carthaginians^ over their subject states in ^Africa^ went so
far, as we learn from ^Polybius^[n5], that, not content with exacting the half
of all the produce of the land, which of itself was a very high rent, they also
loaded them with many other taxes. If we pass from ancient to modern times, we
shall still find the observation to hold. The provinces of absolute monarchies
are always better treated than those of free states. Compare the _Païs conquis_
of ^France^ with ^Ireland^, and you will be convinced of this truth; though this
latter kingdom, being, in a good measure, peopled from ^England^, possesses so
many rights and privileges as should naturally make it challenge better
treatment than that of a conquered province. ^Corsica^ is also an obvious
instance to the same purpose.

{#10,pages=21-2} There is an observation in ^Machiavel^, with regard to the
conquests of ^Alexander^ the Great, which I think, may be regarded as one of
those eternal political truths, which no time nor accidents can vary. It may
seem strange, says that politician, that such sudden conquests, as those of
^Alexander^, should be possessed so peaceably by his successors, and that the
^Persians^, during all the confusions and civil wars among the ^Greeks^, never
made the smallest effort towards the recovery of their former independent
government. To satisfy us concerning the cause of this remarkable event, we may
|consider, that a monarch may govern his subjects in two different ways. He may
either follow the maxims of the eastern princes, and stretch his authority so
far as to leave no distinction of rank among his subjects, but what proceeds
immediately from himself; no advantages of birth; no hereditary honours and
possessions; and, in a word, no credit among the people, except from his
commission alone. Or a monarch may exert his power after a milder manner, like
other ^European^ princes; and leave other sources of honour, beside his smile
and favour: Birth, titles, possessions, valour, integrity, knowledge, or great
and fortunate atchievements. In the former species of government, after a
conquest, it is impossible ever to shake off the yoke; since no one possesses,
among the people, so much personal credit and authority as to begin such an
enterprize: Whereas, in the latter, the least misfortune, or discord among the
victors, will encourage the vanquished to take arms, who have leaders ready to
prompt and conduct them in every undertaking[n6].

{#11,pages=23-4} Such is the reasoning of ^Machiavel^, which seems solid and
conclusive; though I wish he had not mixed falsehood with truth, in asserting,
that monarchies, governed according to eastern policy, though more easily kept
when once subdued, yet are the most difficult to subdue; since they cannot
contain any powerful subject, whose discontent and faction may facilitate the
enterprizes of an enemy. For besides, that such a tyrannical government
enervates the courage of men, and renders them indifferent towards the fortunes
of their sovereign; besides this, I say, we find by experience, that even the
temporary and delegated authority of the generals and |magistrates; being
always, in such governments, as absolute within its sphere, as that of the
prince himself; is able, with barbarians, accustomed to a blind submission, to
produce the most dangerous and fatal revolutions. So that, in every respect, a
gentle government is preferable, and gives the greatest security to the
sovereign as well as to the subject.

{#12,pages=24} Legislators, therefore, ought not to trust the future government
of a state entirely to chance, but ought to provide a system of laws to regulate
the administration of public affairs to the latest posterity. Effects will
always correspond to causes; and wise regulations in any commonwealth are the
most valuable legacy that can be left to future ages. In the smallest court or
office, the stated forms and methods, by which business must be conducted, are
found to be a considerable check on the natural depravity of mankind. Why should
not the case be the same in public affairs? Can we ascribe the stability and
wisdom of the ^Venetian^ government, through so many ages, to any thing but the
form of government? And is it not easy to point out those defects in the
original constitution, which produced the tumultuous governments of ^Athens^ and
^Rome^, and ended at last in the ruin of these two famous republics? And so
little dependance has this affair on the humours and education of particular
men, that one part of the same republic may be wisely conducted, and another
weakly, by the very same men, merely on account of the difference of the forms
and institutions, by which these parts are regulated. Historians inform us that
this was actually the case with ^Genoa^. For while the state was always full of
sedition, and tumult, and disorder, the bank of St. ^George^, which had become a
considerable part of the people, was conducted, for several ages, with the
utmost integrity and wisdom[n7].

{#13,pages=25-6} The ages of greatest public spirit are not always most eminent
for private virtue. Good laws may beget order and moderation in the government,
where the manners and customs have instilled little humanity or justice into the
tempers of men. The most illustrious period of the ^Roman^ history, considered
in a political view, is that between the beginning of the first and end of the
last ^Punic^ war; the due balance between the nobility and the people being then
fixed by the contests of the tribunes, and not being yet lost by the extent of
conquests. Yet at this very time, the horrid practice of poisoning was so
common, that, during part of a season, a _Pr{ae}tor_ punished capitally for this
crime above three thousand[n8] persons in a part of ^Italy^; and found
informations of this nature still multiplying upon him. There is a similar, or
rather |a worse instance[n9], in the more early times of the commonwealth. So
depraved in private life were that people, whom in their histories we so much
admire. I doubt not but they were really more virtuous during the time of the
two _Triumvirates_; when they were tearing their common country to pieces, and
spreading slaughter and desolation over the face of the earth, merely for the
choice of tyrants[n10].

{#14,pages=26-7} Here, then, is a sufficient inducement to maintain, with the
utmost ^Zeal^, in every free state, those forms and institutions, by which
liberty is secured, the public good consulted, and the avarice or ambition of
particular men restrained and punished. Nothing does more honour to human
nature, than to see it susceptible of so noble a passion; as nothing can be a
greater indication of meanness of heart in any man, than to see him destitute of
it. A man who loves only himself, without regard to friendship and desert,
merits the severest blame; |and a man, who is only susceptible of friendship,
without public spirit, or a regard to the community, is deficient in the most
material part of virtue.

{#15,pages=27} But this is a subject which needs not be longer insisted on at
present. There are enow of zealots on both sides who kindle up the passions of
their partizans, and under pretence of public good, pursue the interests and
ends of their particular faction. For my part, I shall always be more fond of
promoting moderation than zeal; though perhaps the surest way of producing
moderation in every party is to increase our zeal for the public. Let us
therefore try, if it be possible, from the foregoing doctrine, to draw a lesson
of moderation with regard to the parties, into which our country is at presentg
divided; at the same time, that we allow not this moderation to abate the
industry and passion, with which every individual is bound to pursue the good of
his country.

{#16,pages=27-8} Those who either attack or defend a minister in such a
government as ours, where the utmost liberty is allowed, always carry matters to
an extreme, and exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the public. His
enemies are sure to charge him with the greatest enormities, both in domestic
and |foreign management; and there is no meanness or crime, of which, in their
account, he is not capable. Unnecessary wars, scandalous treaties, profusion of
public treasure, oppressive taxes, every kind of mal-administration is ascribed
to him. To aggravate the charge, his pernicious conduct, it is said, will extend
its baleful influence even to posterity, by undermining the best constitution in
the world, and disordering that wise system of laws, institutions, and customs,
by which our ancestors, during so many centuries, have been so happily governed.
He is not only a wicked minister in himself, but has removed every security
provided against wicked ministers for the future.

{#17,pages=28} On the other hand, the partizans of the minister make his
panegyric run as high as the accusation against him, and celebrate his wise,
steady, and moderate conduct in every part of his administration. The honour and
interest of the nation supported abroad, public credit maintained at home,
persecution restrained, faction subdued; the merit of all these blessings is
ascribed solely to the minister. At the same time, he crowns all his other
merits by a religious care of the best constitution in the world, which he has
preserved in all its parts, and has transmitted entire, to be the happiness and
security of the latest posterity.

{#18,pages=28-30} When this accusation and panegyric are received by the
partizans of each party, no wonder they beget an extraordinary ferment on both
sides, and fill the nation with violent animosities. But I would fain persuade
these party-zealots, that there is a flat contradiction both in the accusation
and panegyric, and that it were impossible for either of them to run so high,
were it not for this contradiction. If our constitution be really _that noble
fabric, the pride of ^Britain^, the envy of our neighbours, raised by the labour
of so many centuries, repaired at the expence of so many millions, and cemented
by such a profusion of blood_[n11]; I say, if our constitution does in any
degree deserve |these eulogies, it would never have suffered a wicked and weak
minister to govern triumphantly for a course of twenty years, when opposed by
the greatest geniuses in the nation, who exercised the utmost liberty of tongue
and pen, in parliament, and in their frequent appeals to the people. But, if the
minister be wicked and weak, to the degree so strenuously insisted on, the
constitution must be faulty in its original principles, and he cannot
consistently be charged with undermining the best form of government in the
world. A constitution is only so far good, as it provides a remedy against
mal-administration; and if the ^British^, when in its greatest vigour, and
repaired by two such remarkable events, as the _Revolution_ and _Accession_, by
which our ancient royal family was sacrificed to it; if our constitution, I say,
with so great advan|tages, does not, in fact, provide any such remedy, we are
rather beholden to any minister who undermines it, and affords us an opportunity
of erecting a better in its place.

{#19,pages=30} I would employ the same topics to moderate the zeal of those who
defend the minister. _Is our constitution so excellent?_ Then a change of
ministry can be no such dreadful event; since it is essential to such a
constitution, in every ministry, both to preserve itself from violation, and to
prevent all enormities in the administration. _Is our constitution very bad?_
Then so extraordinary a jealousy and apprehension, on account of changes, is ill
placed; and a man should no more be anxious in this case, than a husband, who
had married a woman from the stews, should be watchful to prevent her
infidelity. Public affairs, in such a government, must necessarily go to
confusion, by whatever hands they are conducted; and the zeal of _patriots_ is
in that case much less requisite than the patience and submission of
_philosophers_. The virtue and good intentions of ^Cato^ and ^Brutus^ are highly
laudable; but, to what purpose did their zeal serve? Only to hasten the fatal
period of the ^Roman^ government, and render its convulsions and dying agonies
more violent and painful.

{#20,pages=30-1} I would not be understood to mean, that public affairs deserve
no care and attention at all. Would men be moderate and consistent, their claims
might be admitted; at least might be examined. The _country-party_ might still
assert, that our constitution, though excellent, will admit of
mal-administration to a certain degree; and therefore, if the minister be bad,
it is proper to oppose him with a _suitable_ degree of zeal. And, on the other
hand, the _court-party_ may be allowed, upon the |supposition that the minister
were good, to defend, and with _some_ zeal too, his administration. I would only
persuade men not to contend, as if they were fighting _pro aris & focis_, and
change a good constitution into a bad one, by the violence of their factions.

{#21,pages=31} I have not here considered any thing that is personal in the
present controversy. In the best civil constitution, where every man is
restrained by the most rigid laws, it is easy to discover either the good or bad
intentions of a minister, and to judge, whether his personal character deserve
love or hatred. But such questions are of little importance to the public, and
lay those, who employ their pens upon them, under a just suspicion either of
malevolence or of flattery.

{#n6.1,pages=22-3} I Have taken it for granted, according to the supposition of
^Machiavel^, that the ancient ^Persians^ had no nobility; though there is reason
to suspect, that the ^Florentine^ secretary, who seems to have been better
acquainted with the ^Roman^ than the ^Greek^ authors, was mistaken in this
particular. The more ancient ^Persians^, whose manners are described by
^Xenophon^, were a free people, and had nobility. Their $ομοτιμοι$ were
preserved even after the extending of their conquests and the consequent change
of their government. ^Arrian^ mentions them in ^Darius^'s time, _De exped._
^Alex.^ lib. ii. Historians also speak often of the persons in command as men of
family. ^Tygranes^, who was general of the ^Medes^ under ^Xerxes^, was of the
race of ^Achm{ae}nes^, ^Herod.^ lib. vii. cap. 62. ^Artach{ae}as^, who directed
the cutting of the canal about mount ^Athos^, was of the same family. Id. cap.
117. ^Megabyzus^ was one of the seven eminent ^Persians^ who conspired against
the ^Magi^. His son, ^Zopyrus^, was in the highest command under ^Darius^, and
delivered ^Babylon^ to him. His grandson, ^Megabyzus^, commanded the army,
defeated at ^Marathon^. His great-grandson, ^Zopyrus^, was also eminent, and was
banished {++from++} ^Persia^. ^Herod.^ lib. iii. ^Thuc.^ lib. i. |^Rosaces^, who
commanded an army in ^Egypt^ under ^Artaxerxes^, was also descended from one of
the seven conspirators, ^Diod. Sic.^ lib. xvi. ^Agesilaus^, in ^Xenophon^, Hist.
^Gr{ae}c.^ lib. iv. being desirous of making a marriage betwixt king ^Cotys^ his
ally, and the daughter of ^Spithridates^, a ^Persian^ of rank, who had deserted
to him, first asks ^Cotys^ what family ^Spithridates^ is of. One of the most
considerable in ^Persia^, says ^Cotys^. ^Ari{ae}us^, when offered the
sovereignty by ^Clearchus^ and the ten thousand ^Greeks^, refused it as of too
low a rank, and said, that so many eminent ^Persians^ would never endure his
rule. _Id. de exped._ lib. ii. Some of the families descended from the seven
^Persians^ abovementioned remained during all ^Alexander^'s successors; and
^Mithirdates^, in ^Antiochus^'s time, is said by ^Polybius^ to be descended from
one of them, lib. v. cap. 43. ^Artabazus^ was esteemed, as ^Arrian^ says, $_εν
τοις πρωτοις Περσων_$ lib. iii. And when ^Alexander^ married in one day 80 of
his captains to ^Persian^ women, his intention plainly was to ally the
^Macedonians^ with the most eminent ^Persian^ families. Id. lib. vii. ^Diodorus
Siculus^ says they were of the most noble birth in ^Persia^, lib. xvii. The
government of ^Persia^ was despotic, and conducted in many respects, after the
eastern manner, but was not carried so far as to extirpate all nobility, and
confound all ranks and orders. It left men who were still great, by themselves
and their family, independent of their office and commission. And the reason why
the ^Macedonians^ kept so easily dominion over them was owing to other causes
easy to be found in the historians; though it must be owned that ^Machiavel^'s
reasoning is, in itself, just, however doubtful its application to the present
case.
