£1 ^Sect. XI.^ _With regard to reason or absurdity._ £1

{#1,pages=65} Here is another observation to the same purpose, and a new proof
that the corruption of the best things begets the worst. If we examine, without
prejudice, the ancient heathen mythology, as contained in the poets, we shall
not discover in it any such monstrous absurdity, as we may at first be apt to
apprehend. Where is the difficulty in conceiving, that the same powers or
principles, whatever they were, which formed this visible world, men and
animals, produced also a species of intelligent creatures, of more refined
substance and greater authority than the rest? That these creatures may be
capricious, revengeful, passionate, voluptuous, is easily conceived; nor is any
circumstance more apt, among ourselves, to engender such vices, than the licence
of absolute authority. And in short, the whole mythological system is so
natural, that, in the vast variety of planets and {~~words->worlds~~}, contained
in this universe, it seems more than probable, that, somewhere or other, it is
really carried into execution.

{#2,pages=65} The chief objection to it with regard to this planet, is, that it
is not ascertained by any just reason or authority. The ancient tradition,
insisted on by heathen priests and theologers, is but a weak foundation; and
transmitted also such a number of contradictory reports, supported, all of them,
by equal authority, that it became absolutely impossible to fix a preference
amongst them. A few volumes, therefore, must contain all the polemical writings
of pagan priests: And their whole theology must consist more of traditional
stories and superstitious practices than of philosophical argument and
controversy.

{#3,pages=65-6} But where theism forms the fundamental principle of any popular
religion, that tenet is so conformable to sound reason, that philosophy is apt
to incorporate itself with such a system of theology. And if the other dogmas of
that system be contained in a sacred book, such as the Alcoran, or be determined
by any visible authority, like that of the ^Roman^ pontiff, speculative
reasoners naturally carry on their assent, and embrace a theory, which has been
instilled into them by their earliest education, and which also possesses some
degree of consistence and uniformity. But as these appearances are sure, all of
them, to prove deceitful, philosophy will soon find herself very unequally yoked
with her new associate; and instead of |regulating each principle, as they
advance together, she is at every turn perverted to serve the purposes of
superstition. For besides the unavoidable incoherences, which must be reconciled
and adjusted; one may safely affirm, that all popular theology, especially the
scholastic, has a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction. If that
theology went not beyond reason and common sense, her doctrines would appear too
easy and familiar. Amazement must of necessity be raised: Mystery affected:
Darkness and obscurity sought after: And a foundation of merit afforded to the
devout votaries, who desire an opportunity of subduing their rebellious reason,
by the belief of the most unintelligible sophisms.

{#4,pages=66} Ecclesiastical history sufficiently confirms these reflections.
When a controversy is started, some people always pretend with certainty to
foretell the issue. Whichever opinion, say they, is most contrary to plain sense
is sure to prevail; even where the general interest of the system requires not
that decision. Though the reproach of heresy may, for some time, be bandied
about among the disputants, it always rests at last on the side of reason. Any
one, it is pretended, that has but learning enough of this kind to know the
definition of ^Arian^, ^Pelagian^, ^Erestian^, ^Socinian^, ^Sabellian^,
^Eutychian^, ^Nestorian^, ^Monothelite^, &c. not to mention ^Protestant^, whose
fate is yet uncertain, will be convinced of the truth of this observation. It is
thus a system becomes more absurd in the end, merely from its being reasonable
and philosophical in the beginning.

{#5,pages=66} To oppose the torrent of scholastic religion by such feeble maxims
as these, that _it is impossible for the same thing, to be and not to be_, that
_the whole is greater than a part_, that _two and three make five_; is
pretending to stop the ocean with a bull-rush. Will you set up profane reason
against sacred mystery? No punishment is great enough for your impiety. And the
same fires, which were kindled for heretics, will serve also for the destruction
of philosophers.
