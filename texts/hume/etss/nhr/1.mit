{#1,pages=34} It appears to me, that, if we consider the improvement of human
society, from rude beginnings to a state of greater perfection, polytheism or
idolatry was, and necessarily must have been, the first and most ancient
religion of mankind. This opinion I shall endeavour to confirm by the following
arguments.

{#2,pages=34} It is a matter of fact incontestable, that about 1700 years ago
all mankind were polytheists. The doubtful and sceptical principles of a few
philosophers, or the theism, and that too not entirely pure, of one or two
nations, form no objection worth regarding. Behold then the clear testimony of
history. The farther we mount up into antiquity, the more do we find mankind
plunged into polytheism. No marks, no symptoms of any more perfect religion. The
most ancient records of human race still present us with that system as the
popular and established creed. The north, the south, the east, the west, give
their unanimous testimony to the same fact. What can be opposed to so full an
evidence?

{#3,pages=34} As far as writing or history reaches, mankind, in ancient times,
appear universally to have been polytheists. Shall we assert, that, in more
ancient times, before the knowledge of letters, or the discovery of any art or
science, men entertained the principles of pure theism? That is, while they were
ignorant and barbarous, they discovered truth: But fell into error, as soon as
they acquired learning and politeness.

{#4,pages=34} But in this assertion you not only contradict all appearance of
probability, but also our present experience concerning the principles and
opinions of barbarous nations. The savage tribes of ^America^, ^Africa^, and
^Asia^ are all idolaters. Not a single exception to this rule. Insomuch, that,
were a traveller to transport himself into any unknown region; if he found
inhabitants cultivated with arts and science, though even upon that supposition
there are odds against their being theists, yet could he not safely, till
farther inquiry, pronounce any thing on that head: But if he found them ignorant
and barbarous, he might beforehand declare them idolaters; and there scarcely is
a possibility of his being mistaken.

{#5,pages=34-5} It seems certain, that, according to the natural progress of
human thought, the ignorant multitude must first entertain some groveling and
|familiar notion of superior powers, before they stretch their conception to
that perfect Being, who bestowed order on the whole frame of nature. We may as
reasonably imagine, that men inhabited palaces before huts and cottages, or
studied geometry before agriculture; as assert that the Deity appeared to them a
pure spirit, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, before he was apprehended
to be a powerful, though limited being, with human passions and appetites, limbs
and organs. The mind rises gradually, from inferior to superior: By abstracting
from what is imperfect, it forms an idea of perfection: And slowly
distinguishing the nobler parts of its own frame from the grosser, it learns to
transfer only the former, much elevated and refined, to its divinity. Nothing
could disturb this natural progress of thought, but some obvious and invincible
argument, which might immediately lead the mind into the pure principles of
theism, and make it overleap, at one bound, the vast interval which is
interposed between the human and the divine nature. But though I allow, that the
order and frame of the universe, when accurately examined, affords such an
argument; yet I can never think, that this consideration could have an influence
on mankind, when they formed their first rude notions of religion.

{#6,pages=35-6} The causes of such objects, as are quite familiar to us, never
strike our attention or curiosity; and however extraordinary or surprising these
objects in themselves, they are passed over, by the raw and ignorant multitude,
without much examination or enquiry. ^Adam^, rising at once, in paradise, and in
the full perfection of his faculties, would naturally, as represented by
^Milton^, be astonished at the glorious appearances of nature, the heavens, the
air, the earth, his own organs and members; and would be led to ask, whence this
wonderful scene arose. But a barbarous, necessitous animal (such as a man is on
the first origin of society), pressed by such numerous wants and passions, has
no leisure to admire the regular face of nature, or make enquiries concerning
the cause of those objects, to which from his infancy he has been gradually
accustomed. On the contrary, the more regular and uniform, that is, the more
perfect nature appears, the more is he familiarized to it, and the less inclined
to scrutinize and examine it. A monstrous birth excites his curiosity, and is
deemed a prodigy. It alarms him from its novelty; and immediately sets him a
trembling, and sacrificing, and praying. But an animal, compleat in all its
limbs and organs, is to him an ordinary spectacle, and produces no religious
opinion or affection. Ask him, whence that animal arose; he will tell you, from
the copulation of its parents. And these, whence? From the copulation of theirs.
A few removes satisfy his curiosity, and set the objects at such a distance,
that he entirely loses sight of them. Imagine not, that he will so much as start
the |question, whence the first animal; much less, whence the whole system or
united fabric of the universe arose. Or, if you start such a question to him,
expect not, that he will employ his mind with any anxiety about a subject, so
remote, so uninteresting, and which so much exceeds the bounds of his capacity.

{#7,pages=36} But farther, if men were at first led into the belief of one
Supreme Being, by reasoning from the frame of nature, they could never possibly
leave that belief, in order to embrace polytheism; but the same principles of
reason, which at first produced and diffused over mankind, so magnificent an
opinion, must be able, with greater facility, to preserve it. The first
invention and proof of any doctrine is much more difficult than the supporting
and retaining of it.

{#8,pages=36} There is a great difference between historical facts and
speculative opinions; nor is the knowledge of the one propagated in the same
manner with that of the other. An historical fact, while it passes by oral
tradition from eye-witnesses and contemporaries, is disguised in every
successive narration, and may at last retain but very small, if any, resemblance
of the original truth, on which it was founded. The frail memories of men, their
love of exaggeration, their supine carelessness; these principles, if not
corrected by books and writing, soon pervert the account of historical events;
where argument or reasoning has little or no place, nor can ever recal the
truth, which has once escaped those narrations. It is thus the fables of
^Hercules^, ^Theseus^, ^Bacchus^ are supposed to have been originally founded in
true history, corrupted by tradition. But with regard to speculative opinions,
the case is far otherwise. If these opinions be founded on arguments so clear
and obvious as to carry conviction with the generality of mankind, the same
arguments, which at first diffused the opinions, will still preserve them in
their original purity. If the arguments be more abstruse, and more remote from
vulgar apprehension, the opinions will always be confined to a few persons; and
as soon as men leave the contemplation of the arguments, the opinions will
immediately be lost and be buried in oblivion. Whichever side of this dilemma we
take, it must appear impossible, that theism could, from reasoning, have been
the primary religion of human race, and have afterwards, by its corruption,
given birth to polytheism and to all the various superstitions of the heathen
world. Reason, when obvious, prevents these corruptions: When abstruse, it keeps
the principles entirely from the knowledge of the vulgar, who are alone liable
to corrupt any principle or opinion.
