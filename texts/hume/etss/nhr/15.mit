{#1,pages=85} Though the stupidity of men, barbarous and uninstructed, be so
great, that they may not see a sovereign author in the more obvious works of
nature, to which they are so much familiarized; yet it scarcely seems possible,
that any one of good understanding should reject that idea, when once it is
suggested to him. A purpose, an intention, a design is evident in every thing;
and when our comprehension is so far enlarged as to contemplate the first rise
of this visible system, we must adopt, with the strongest conviction, the idea
of some intelligent cause or author. The uniform maxims too, which prevail
throughout the whole frame of the universe, naturally, if not necessarily, lead
us to conceive this intelligence as single and undivided, where the prejudices
of education oppose not so reasonable a theory. Even the contrarieties of
nature, by discovering themselves every where, become proofs of some consistent
plan, and establish one single purpose or intention, however inexplicable and
incomprehensible.

{#2,pages=85} Good and ill are universally intermingled and confounded;
happiness and misery, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and
entirely of a piece. All advantages are attended with disadvantages. An
universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence. And it
is not possible for us, by our most chimerical wishes, to form the idea of a
station or situation altogether desirable. The draughts of life, according to
the poet's fiction, are always mixed from the vessels on each hand of ^Jupiter^:
Or if any cup be presented altogether pure, it is drawn only, as the same poet
tells us, from the left-handed vessel.

{#3,pages=85} The more exquisite any good is, of which a small specimen is
afforded us, the sharper is the evil, allied to it; and few exceptions are found
to this uniform law of nature. The most sprightly wit borders on madness; the
highest effusions of joy produce the deepest melancholy; the most ravishing
pleasures are attended with the most cruel lassitude and disgust; the most
flattering hopes make way for the severest disappointments. And, in general, no
course of life has such safety (for happiness is not to be dreamed of) as the
temperate and moderate, which maintains, as far as possible, a mediocrity, and a
kind of insensibility, in every thing.

{#4,pages=86} As the good, the great, the sublime, the ravishing are found
eminently in the genuine principles of theism; it may be expected, from the
analogy of nature, that the base, the absurd, the mean, the terrifying will be
equally discovered in religious fictions and chimeras.

{#5,pages=86} The universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent
power, if not an original instinct, being at least a general attendant of human
nature, may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman
has set upon his work; and nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to be
thus selected from all other parts of the creation, and to bear the image or
impression of the universal Creator. But consult this image, as it appears in
the popular religions of the world. How is the deity disfigured in our
representations of him! What caprice, absurdity, and immorality are attributed
to him! How much is he degraded even below the character, which we should
naturally, in common life, ascribe to a man of sense and virtue!

{#6,pages=86} What a noble privilege is it of human reason to attain the
knowledge of the supreme Being; and, from the visible works of nature, be
enabled to infer so sublime a principle as its supreme Creator? But turn the
reverse of the medal. Survey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious
principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be
persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard
them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious,
positive, dogmatical asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the
name of rational.

{#7,pages=86} Hear the verbal protestations of all men: Nothing so certain as
their religious tenets. Examine their lives: You will scarcely think that they
repose the smallest confidence in them.

{#8,pages=86} The greatest and truest zeal gives us no security against
hypocrisy: The most open impiety is attended with a secret dread and
compunction.

{#9,pages=86} No theological absurdities so glaring that they have not,
sometimes, been embraced by men of the greatest and most cultivated
understanding. No religious precepts so rigorous that they have not been adopted
by the most voluptuous and most abandoned of men.

{#10,pages=86} _Ignorance is the mother of Devotion:_ A maxim that is
proverbial, and confirmed by general experience. Look out for a people, entirely
destitute of religion: If you find them at all, be assured, that they are but
few degrees removed from brutes.

{#11,pages=86} What so pure as some of the morals, included in some theological
systems? What so corrupt as some of the practices, to which these systems give
rise?

{#12,pages=87} The comfortable views, exhibited by the belief of futurity, are
ravishing and delightful. But how quickly vanish on the appearance of its
terrors, which keep a more firm and durable possession of the human mind?

{#13,pages=87} The whole is a riddle, an {ae}nigma, an inexplicable mystery.
Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of judgment appear the only result of our most
accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. But such is the frailty of human
reason, and such the irresistible contagion of opinion, that even this
deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld; did we not enlarge our view, and
opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a quarrelling; while
we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape, into
the calm, though obscure, regions of philosophy.
