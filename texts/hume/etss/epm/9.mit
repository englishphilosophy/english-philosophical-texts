{#1,pages=268-9} IT may justly appear surprising, that any man, in so late an
age, should find it requisite to prove, by elaborate reasoning, that PERSONAL
MERIT consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities, _useful_ or
_agreeable_ to the _person himself_ or to _others_. It might be expected, that
this principle would have occurred even to the first rude, unpractised enquirers
concerning morals, and been received from its own evidence, without any argument
or disputation. Whatever is valuable in any kind, so naturally classes itself
under the division of _useful_ or _agreeable_, the _utile_ or the _dulce_, that
it is not easy to imagine, why we should ever seek farther, or consider the
question as a matter of nice research or enquiry. And as every thing useful or
agreeable must possess these qualities with regard either to the _person
himself_ or to _others_, the compleat delineation or description of merit seems
to be performed as naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun, or an image is
reflected upon water. If the ground, on which the shadow is cast, be not broken
and uneven; nor the surface, from which the image is reflected, disturbed and
confused; a just figure is immediately presented, without any art or attention.
And it seems a reasonable presumption, that systems and hypotheses have
perverted our natural understanding; when a theory, |so simple and obvious,
could so long have escaped the most elaborate examination.

{#2,pages=269-70} But however the case may have fared with philosophy; in common
life, these principles are still implicitly maintained, nor is any other topic
of praise or blame ever recurred to, when we employ any panegyric or satire, any
applause or censure of human action and behaviour. If we observe men, in every
intercourse of business or pleasure, in every discourse and conversation; we
shall find them no where, except in the schools, at any loss upon this subject.
What so natural, for instance, as the following dialogue? You are very happy, we
shall suppose one to say, addressing himself to another, that you have given
your daughter to ^Cleanthes^. He is a man of honour and humanity. Every one, who
has any intercourse with him, is sure of _fair_ and _kind_ treatment[n53]. I
congratulate you too, says another{++,++} on the promising expectations of this
son-in-law; whose assiduous application to the study of the laws, whose quick
penetration and early knowledge both of men and business, prognosticate the
greatest honours and advancement[n54]. You surprize me, replies a third, when
you talk of ^Cleanthes^ as a man of business and application. I met him lately
in a circle of the gayest company, and he was the very life and soul of our
conversation: So much wit with good manners; so much gallantry without
affectation; so much ingenious knowledge so genteelly delivered, I have never
before observed in any one[n55]. You would admire him still more, says a fourth,
if you knew him more familiarly. That chearfulness, which you might remark in
him, is not a sudden flash struck out by company: It runs through the whole
tenor of his life, and preserves a perpetual serenity on his countenance, and
tranquillity in his soul. He has |met with severe trials, misfortunes as well as
dangers; and by his greatness of mind, was still superior to all of them[n56].
The image, gentlemen, which you have here delineated of ^Cleanthes^, cry'd I, is
that of accomplished merit. Each of you has given a stroke of the pencil to his
figure; and you have unawares exceeded all the pictures drawn by ^Gratian^ or
^Castiglione^. A philosopher might select this character as a model of perfect
virtue.

{#3,pages=270} And as every quality, which is useful or agreeable to ourselves
or others, is, in common life, allowed to be a part of personal merit; so no
other will ever be received, where men judge of things by their natural,
unprejudiced reason, without the delusive glosses of superstition and false
religion. Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility,
silence, solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues; for what reason are
they every where rejected by men of sense, but because they serve to no manner
of purpose; neither advance a man's fortune in the world, nor render him a more
valuable member of society; neither qualify him for the entertainment of
company, nor encrease his power of self-enjoyment? We observe, on the contrary,
that they cross all these desirable ends; stupify the understanding and harden
the heart, obscure the fancy and sour the temper. We justly, therefore, transfer
them to the opposite column, and place them in the catalogue of vices; nor has
any superstition force sufficient among men of the world, to pervert entirely
these natural sentiments. A gloomy, hair-brained enthusiast, after his death,
may have a place in the calendar; but will scarcely ever be admitted, when
alive, into intimacy and society, except by those who are as delirious and
dismal as himself.

{#4,pages=270-1} It seems a happiness in the present theory, that it enters not
into that vulgar dispute concerning the _degrees_ of benevolence or self-love,
which prevail in human nature; |a dispute which is never likely to have any
issue, both because men, who have taken part, are not easily convinced, and
because the ph{ae}nomena, which can be produced on either side, are so
dispersed, so uncertain, and subject to so many interpretations, that it is
scarcely possible accurately to compare them, or draw from them any determinate
inference or conclusion. It is sufficient for our present purpose, if it be
allowed, what surely, without the greatest absurdity, cannot be disputed, that
there is some benevolence, however small, infused into our bosom; some spark of
friendship for human kind; some particle of the dove, kneaded into our frame,
along with the elements of the wolf and serpent. Let these generous sentiments
be supposed ever so weak; let them be insufficient to move even a hand or finger
of our body; they must still direct the determinations of our mind, and where
every thing else is equal, produce a cool preference of what is useful and
serviceable to mankind, above what is pernicious and dangerous. A _moral
distinction_, therefore, immediately arises; a general sentiment of blame and
approbation; a tendency, however faint, to the objects of the one, and a
proportionable aversion to those of the other. Nor will those reasoners, who so
earnestly maintain the predominant selfishness of human kind, be any wise
scandalized at hearing of the weak sentiments of virtue, implanted in our
nature. On the contrary, they are found as ready to maintain the one tenet as
the other; and their spirit of satire (for such it appears, rather than of
corruption) naturally gives rise to both opinions; which have, indeed, a great
and almost an indissoluble connexion together.

{#5,pages=271-2} Avarice, ambition, vanity, and all passions vulgarly, though
improperly, comprized under the denomination of _self-love_, are here excluded
from our theory concerning the origin of morals, not because they are too weak,
but because they have not a proper direction, for that purpose. |The notion of
morals, implies some sentiment common to all mankind, which recommends the same
object to general approbation, and makes every man, or most men, agree in the
same opinion or decision concerning it. It also implies some sentiment, so
universal and comprehensive as to extend to all mankind, and render the actions
and conduct, even of the persons the most remote, an object of applause or
censure, according as they agree or disagree with that rule of right which is
established. These two requisite circumstances belong alone to the sentiment of
humanity here insisted on. The other passions produce, in every breast, many
strong sentiments of desire and aversion, affection and hatred; but these
neither are felt so much in common, nor are so comprehensive, as to be the
foundation of any general system and established theory of blame or approbation.

{#6,pages=272-3} When a man denominates another his _enemy_, his _rival_, his
_antagonist_, his _adversary_, he is understood to speak the language of
self-love, and to express sentiments, peculiar to himself, and arising from his
particular circumstances and situation. But when he bestows on any man the
epithets of _vicious_ or _odious_ or _depraved_, he then speaks another
language, and expresses sentiments, in which, he expects, all his audience are
to concur with him. He must here, therefore, depart from his private and
particular situation, and must chuse a point of view, common to him with others:
He must move some universal principle of the human frame, and touch a string, to
which all mankind have an accord and symphony. If he mean, therefore, to
express, that this man possesses qualities, whose tendency is pernicious to
society, he has chosen this common point of view, and has touched the principle
of humanity, in which every man, in some degree, concurs. While the human heart
is compounded of the same elements as at present, it will never be wholly
indifferent to public good, |nor entirely unaffected with the tendency of
characters and manners. And though this affection of humanity may not generally
be esteemed so strong as vanity or ambition, yet, being common to all men, it
can alone be the foundation of morals, or of any general system of blame or
praise. One man's ambition is not another's ambition; nor will the same event or
object satisfy both: But the humanity of one man is the humanity of every one;
and the same object touches this passion in all human creatures.

{#7,pages=273} But the sentiments, which arise from humanity, are not only the
same in all human creatures, and produce the same approbation or censure; but
they also comprehend all human creatures; nor is there any one whose conduct or
character is not, by their means, an object, to every one, of censure or
approbation. On the contrary, those other passions, commonly denominated
selfish, both produce different sentiments in each individual, according to his
particular situation; and also contemplate the greater part of mankind with the
utmost indifference and unconcern. Whoever has a high regard and esteem for me
flatters my vanity; whoever expresses contempt mortifies and displeases me: But
as my name is known but to a small part of mankind, there are few, who come
within the sphere of this passion, or excite, on its account, either my
affection or disgust. But if you represent a tyrannical, insolent, or barbarous
behaviour, in any country or in any age of the world; I soon carry my eye to the
pernicious tendency of such a conduct, and feel the sentiment of repugnance and
displeasure towards it. No character can be so remote as to be, in this light,
wholly indifferent to me. What is beneficial to society or to the person himself
must still be preferred. And every quality or action, of every human being,
must, by this means, be ranked under some class or denomination, expressive of
general censure or applause.

{#8,pages=273-4} What more, therefore, can we ask to distinguish the
|sentiments, dependant on humanity, from those connected with any other passion,
or to satisfy us, why the former are the origin of morals, not the latter?
Whatever conduct gains my approbation, by touching my humanity, procures also
the applause of all mankind, by affecting the same principle in them: But what
serves my avarice or ambition pleases these passions in me alone, and affects
not the avarice and ambition of the rest of mankind. There is no circumstance of
conduct in any man, provided it have a beneficial tendency, that is not
agreeable to my humanity, however remote the person: But every man, so far
removed as neither to cross nor serve my avarice and ambition, is regarded as
wholly indifferent by those passions. The distinction, therefore, between these
species of sentiment being so great and evident, language must soon be moulded
upon it, and must invent a peculiar set of terms, in order to express those
universal sentiments of censure or approbation, which arise from humanity, or
from views of general usefulness and its contrary. VIRTUE and VICE become then
known: Morals are recognized: Certain general ideas are framed of human conduct
and behaviour: Such measures are expected from men, in such situations: This
action is determined to be conformable to our abstract rule; that other,
contrary. And by such universal principles are the particular sentiments of
self-love frequently controuled and limited[n57].

{#9,pages=275-6} From instances of popular tumults, seditions, factions, panics,
and of all passions, which are shared with a multitude; we may learn the
influence of society, in exciting and supporting any emotion; while the most
ungovernable disorders are raised, we find, by that means, from the slightest
and most frivolous occasions. ^Solon^ was no very cruel, though, perhaps, an
unjust legislator, who punished neuters in civil wars; and few, I believe,
would, in such cases, incur the penalty, were their affection and discourse
allowed sufficient to absolve them. No selfishness, and scarce any philosophy,
have there force sufficient to support a total coolness and indifference; and he
must be more or less than man, who kindles not in the common blaze. What wonder
then, that moral sentiments are found of such influence in life; though
springing from principles, which may appear, at first sight, somewhat small and
delicate? But these principles, we must remark, are social and universal: They
form, in a manner, the _party_ of human-kind against vice or disorder, its
common enemy: And as the benevolent concern for others is diffused, in a greater
or less degree, over all men, and is the same in all, it occurs more frequently
in discourse, is cherished by society and conversation, and the blame and
approbation, consequent on it, are thereby rouzed from that lethargy, into which
they are probably lulled, in solitary and uncultivated nature. Other passions,
though perhaps originally stronger, yet |being selfish and private, are often
overpowered by its force, and yield the dominion of our breast to those social
and public principles.

{#10,pages=276} Another spring of our constitution, that brings a great addition
of force to moral sentiment, is, the love of fame; which rules, with such
uncontrolled authority, in all generous minds, and is often the grand object of
all their designs and undertakings. By our continual and earnest pursuit of a
character, a name, a reputation in the world, we bring our own deportment and
conduct frequently in review, and consider how they appear in the eyes of those
who approach and regard us. This constant habit of surveying ourselves, as it
were, in reflection, keeps alive all the sentiments of right and wrong, and
begets, in noble natures, a certain reverence for themselves as well as others;
which is the surest guardian of every virtue. The animal conveniencies and
pleasures sink gradually in their value; while every inward beauty and moral
grace is studiously acquired, and the mind is accomplished in every perfection,
which can adorn or embellish a rational creature.

{#11,pages=276} Here is the most perfect morality with which we are acquainted:
Here is displayed the force of many sympathies. Our moral sentiment is itself a
feeling chiefly of that nature: And our regard to a character with others seems
to arise only from a care of preserving a character with ourselves; and in order
to attain this end, we find it necessary to prop our tottering judgment on the
correspondent approbation of mankind.

{#12,pages=276-8} But, that we may accommodate matters, and remove, if possible,
every difficulty, let us allow all these reasonings to be false. Let us allow,
that, when we resolve the pleasure, which arises from views of utility, into the
sentiments of humanity and sympathy, we have embraced a wrong hypothesis. Let us
confess it necessary to find some other explication of that applause, which is
paid to objects, whether |inanimate, animate, or rational, if they have a
tendency to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind. However difficult it
be to conceive, that an object is approved of on account of its tendency to a
certain end, while the end itself is totally indifferent; let us swallow this
absurdity, and consider what are the consequences. The preceding delineation or
definition of PERSONAL MERIT must still retain its evidence and authority: It
must still be allowed, that every quality of the mind, which is _useful_ or
_agreeable_ to the _person himself_ or to _others_, communicates a pleasure to
the spectator, engages his esteem, and is admitted under the honourable
denomination of virtue or merit. Are not justice, fidelity, honour, veracity,
allegiance, chastity, esteemed solely on account of their tendency to promote
the good of society? Is not that tendency inseparable from humanity,
benevolence, lenity, generosity, gratitude, moderation, tenderness, friendship,
and all the other social virtues? Can it possibly be doubted, that industry,
discretion, frugality, secrecy, order, perseverance, forethought, judgment, and
this whole class of virtues and accomplishments, of which many pages would not
contain the catalogue; can it be doubted, I say, that the tendency of these
qualities to promote the interest and happiness of their possessor, is the sole
foundation of their merit? Who can dispute that a mind, which supports a
perpetual serenity and chearfulness, a noble dignity and undaunted spirit, a
tender affection and good-will to all around; as it has more enjoyment within
itself, is also a more animating and rejoicing spectacle, than if dejected with
melancholy, tormented with anxiety, irritated with rage, or sunk into the most
abject baseness and degeneracy? And as to the qualities, immediately _agreeable
to others_, they speak sufficiently for themselves; and he must be unhappy,
indeed, either in his own temper, or in his situation and company, who has never
perceived the charms of a facetious wit or flowing affability, of a |delicate
modesty or decent genteelness of address and manner.

{#13,pages=278} I am sensible, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to
be positive or dogmatical on any subject; and that, even if _excessive_
scepticism could be maintained, it would not be more destructive to all just
reasoning and enquiry. I am convinced, that, where men are the most sure and
arrogant, they are commonly the most mistaken, and have there given reins to
passion, without that proper deliberation and suspence, which can alone secure
them from the grossest absurdities. Yet, I must confess, that this enumeration
puts the matter in so strong a light, that I cannot, _at present_, be more
assured of any truth, which I learn from reasoning and argument, than that
personal merit consists entirely in the usefulness or agreeableness of qualities
to the person himself possessed of them, or to others, who have any intercourse
with him. But when I reflect, that, though the bulk and figure of the earth have
been measured and delineated, though the motions of the tides have been
accounted for, the order and {oe}conomy of the heavenly bodies subjected to
their proper laws, and INFINITE itself reduced to calculation; yet men still
dispute concerning the foundation of their moral duties: When I reflect on this,
I say, I fall back into diffidence and scepticism, and suspect, that an
hypothesis, so obvious, had it been a true one, would, long ere now, have been
received by the unanimous suffrage and consent of mankind.

{#14,pages=278-9} Having explained the moral _approbation_ attending merit or
virtue, there remains nothing, but briefly to consider our interested
_obligation_ to it, and to enquire, whether every man, who has any regard to his
own happiness and welfare, will not best find his account in the practice of
every moral duty. If this can be clearly ascertained from the foregoing |theory,
we shall have the satisfaction to reflect, that we have advanced principles,
which not only, it is hoped, will stand the test of reasoning and enquiry, but
may contribute to the amendment of men's lives, and their improvement in
morality and social virtue. And though the philosophical truth of any
proposition by no means depends on its tendency to promote the interests of
society; yet a man has but a bad grace, who delivers a theory, however true,
which, he must confess, leads to a practice dangerous and pernicious. Why rake
into those corners of nature, which spread a nuisance all around? Why dig up the
pestilence from the pit, in which it is buried? The ingenuity of your researches
may be admired; but your systems will be detested: And mankind will agree, if
they cannot refute them, to sink them, at least, in eternal silence and
oblivion. Truths, which are _pernicious_ to society, if any such there be, will
yield to errors, which are salutary and _advantageous_.

{#15,pages=279-80} But what philosophical truths can be more advantageous to
society, than those here delivered, which represent virtue in all her genuine
and most engaging charms, and make us approach her with ease, familiarity, and
affection? The dismal dress falls off, with which many divines, and some
philosophers have covered her; and nothing appears but gentleness, humanity,
beneficence, affability; nay even, at proper intervals, play, frolic, and
gaiety. She talks not of useless austerities and rigours, suffering and
self-denial. She declares, that her sole purpose is, to make her votaries and
all mankind, during every instant of their existence, if possible, cheerful and
happy; nor does she ever willingly part with any pleasure but in hopes of ample
compensation in some other period of their lives. The sole trouble, which she
demands, is that of just calculation, and a steady preference of the greater
happiness. And if any austere pretenders approach her, enemies to joy and
pleasure, she either rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers; or if she |admit
them in her train, they are ranked however, among the least favoured of her
votaries.

{#16,pages=280} And, indeed, to drop all figurative expression, what hopes can
we ever have of engaging mankind to a practice, which we confess full of
austerity and rigour? Or what theory of morals can ever serve any useful
purpose, unless it can show, by a particular detail, that all the duties, which
it recommends, are also the true interest of each individual? The peculiar
advantage of the foregoing system seems to be, that it furnishes proper mediums
for that purpose.

{#17,pages=280} That the virtues which are immediately _useful_ or _agreeable_
to the person possessed of them, are desirable in a view to self-interest, it
would surely be superfluous to prove. Moralists, indeed, may spare themselves
all the pains, which they often take in recommending these duties. To what
purpose collect arguments to evince, that temperance is advantageous, and the
excesses of pleasure hurtful? When it appears, that these excesses are only
denominated such, because they are hurtful; and that, if the unlimited use of
strong liquors, for instance, no more impaired health or the faculties of mind
and body than the use of air or water, it would not be a whit more vicious or
blameable.

{#18,pages=280-1} It seems equally superfluous to prove, that the
_companionable_ virtues of good manners and wit, decency and genteelness, are
more desirable than the contrary qualities. Vanity alone, without any other
consideration, is a sufficient motive to make us wish for the possession of
these accomplishments. No man was ever willingly deficient in this particular.
All our failures here proceed from bad education, want of capacity, or a
perverse and unpliable disposition. Would you have your company coveted,
admired, followed; rather than hated, despised, avoided? Can any one seriously
deliberate in the case? As no enjoyment is sincere, without some reference to
company and society; so no society can be agreeable, or even tolerable, where a
man feels his |presence unwelcome, and discovers all around him symptoms of
disgust and aversion.

{#19,pages=281} But why, in the greater society or confederacy of mankind,
should not the case be the same as in particular clubs and companies? Why is it
more doubtful, that the enlarged virtues of humanity, generosity, beneficence,
are desirable with a view to happiness and self-interest, than the limited
endowments of ingenuity and politeness? Are we apprehensive, lest those social
affections interfere, in a greater and more immediate degree than any other
pursuits, with private utility, and cannot be gratified, without some important
sacrifice of honour and advantage? If so, we are but ill instructed in the
nature of the human passions, and are more influenced by verbal distinctions
than by real differences.

{#20,pages=281} Whatever contradiction may vulgarly be supposed between the
_selfish_ and _social_ sentiments or dispositions, they are really no more
opposite than selfish and ambitious, selfish and revengeful, selfish and vain.
It is requisite, that there be an original propensity of some kind, in order to
be a basis to self-love, by giving a relish to the objects of its pursuit; and
none more fit for this purpose than benevolence or humanity. The goods of
fortune are spent in one gratification or another: The miser, who accumulates
his annual income, and lends it out at interest, has really spent it in the
gratification of his avarice. And it would be difficult to show, why a man is
more a loser by a generous action, than by any other method of expence; since
the utmost which he can attain, by the most elaborate selfishness, is the
indulgence of some affection.

{#21,pages=281-2} Now if life, without passion, must be altogether insipid and
tiresome; let a man suppose that he has full power of modelling his own
disposition, and let him deliberate what appetite or desire he would choose for
the foundation of his happiness and enjoyment. Every affection, he would
|observe, when gratified by success, gives a satisfaction proportioned to its
force and violence; but besides this advantage, common to all, the immediate
feeling of benevolence and friendship, humanity and kindness, is sweet, smooth,
tender, and agreeable, independent of all fortune and accidents. These virtues
are besides attended with a pleasing consciousness or remembrance, and keep us
in humour with ourselves as well as others; while we retain the agreeable
reflection of having done our part towards mankind and society. And though all
men show a jealousy of our success in the pursuits of avarice and ambition; yet
are we almost sure of their good-will and good-wishes, so long as we persevere
in the paths of virtue, and employ ourselves in the execution of generous plans
and purposes. What other passion is there where we shall find so many advantages
united; an agreeable sentiment, a pleasing consciousness, a good reputation? But
of these truths, we may observe, men are, of themselves, pretty much convinced;
nor are they deficient in their duty to society, because they would not wish to
be generous, friendly, and humane; but because they do not feel themselves such.

{#22,pages=282-3} Treating vice with the greatest candour, and making it all
possible concessions, we must acknowledge, that there is not, in any instance,
the smallest pretext for giving it the preference above virtue, with a view to
self-interest; except, perhaps, in the case of justice, where a man, taking
things in a certain light, may often seem to be a loser by his integrity. And
though it is allowed, that, without a regard to property, no society could
subsist; yet, according to the imperfect way in which human affairs are
conducted, a sensible knave, in particular incidents, may think, that an act of
iniquity or infidelity will make a considerable addition to his fortune, without
causing any considerable breach in the social union and confederacy. That
_honesty is the best policy_, may be a good general rule; but is liable to many
exceptions: And |he, it may, perhaps, be thought, conducts himself with most
wisdom, who observes the general rule, and takes advantage of all the
exceptions.

{#23,pages=283} I must confess, that, if a man think, that this reasoning much
requires an answer, it will be a little difficult to find any, which will to him
appear satisfactory and convincing. If his heart rebel not against such
pernicious maxims, if he feel no reluctance to the thoughts of villany or
baseness, he has indeed lost a considerable motive to virtue; and we may expect,
that his practice will be answerable to his speculation. But in all ingenuous
natures, the antipathy to treachery and roguery is too strong to be
counterbalanced by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage. Inward peace of
mind, consciousness of integrity, a satisfactory review of our own conduct;
these are circumstances very requisite to happiness, and will be cherished and
cultivated by every honest man, who feels the importance of them.

{#24,pages=283} Such a one has, besides, the frequent satisfaction of seeing
knaves, with all their pretended cunning and abilities, betrayed by their own
maxims; and while they purpose to cheat with moderation and secrecy, a tempting
incident occurs, nature is frail, and they give into the snare; whence they can
never extricate themselves, without a total loss of reputation, and the
forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with mankind.

{#25,pages=283-4} But were they ever so secret and successful, the honest man,
if he has any tincture of philosophy, or even common observation and reflection,
will discover that they themselves are, in the end, the greatest dupes, and have
sacrificed the invaluable enjoyment of a character, with themselves at least,
for the acquisition of worthless toys and gewgaws. How little is requisite to
supply the _necessities_ of nature? And in a view to _pleasure_, what comparison
between the unbought satisfaction of conversation, society, study, even health
and |the common beauties of nature, but above all the peaceful reflection on
one's own conduct: What comparison, I say, between these, and the feverish,
empty amusements of luxury and expence? These natural pleasures, indeed, are
really without price; both because they are below all price in their attainment,
and above it in their enjoyment.

{#n57.1,pages=274-5} IT seems certain, both from reason and experience, that a
rude, untaught savage regulates chiefly his love and hatred by the ideas of
private utility and injury, and has but faint conceptions of a general rule or
system of behaviour. The man who stands opposite to him in battle, he hates
heartedly, not only for the present moment, which is almost unavoidable, but for
ever after; nor is he satisfied without the most extreme punishment and
vengeance. But we, accustomed to society, and to more enlarged reflections,
consider, that this man is serving his own country and community; that any man,
in the same situation, would do the same; that we ourselves, in like
circumstances, observe a like conduct; that, in general, human society is best
supported on such maxims: |And by these suppositions and views, we correct, in
some measure, our ruder and narrower passions. And though much of our friendship
and enmity be still regulated by private considerations of benefit and harm, we
pay, at least, this homage to general rules, which we are accustomed to respect,
that we commonly pervert our adversary's conduct, by imputing malice or
injustice to him, in order to give vent to those passions, which arise from
self-love and private interest. When the heart is full of rage, it never wants
pretences of this nature; though sometimes as frivolous, as those from which
^Horace^, being almost crushed by the fall of a tree, affects to accuse of
parricide the first planter of it.
