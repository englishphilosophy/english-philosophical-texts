£2 Of the ^Academical^ or ^Sceptical Philosophy^. £2

{#1,pages=149} THERE is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings,
displayed upon any subject, than those, which prove the existence of a Deity,
and refute the fallacies of _Atheists_; and yet the most religious philosophers
still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist.
How shall we reconcile these contradictions? The knights-errant, who wandered
about to clear the world of dragons and giants, never entertained the least
doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters.

{#2,pages=149} The _Sceptic_ is another enemy of religion, who naturally
provokes the indignation of all divines and graver philosophers; though it is
certain, that no man ever met with any such absurd creature, or conversed with a
man, who had no opinion or principle concerning any subject, either of action or
speculation. This begets a very natural question; What is meant by a sceptic?
And how far it is possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and
uncertainty?

{#3,pages=149-50} There is a species of scepticism, _antecedent_ to all study
and philosophy, which is much inculcated by ^Des^ ^Cartes^ and others, as a
sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgment. It recommends an
universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and principles, but also of
our very faculties; of whose veracity, say they, we must |assure ourselves, by a
chain of reasoning, deduced from some original principle, which cannot possibly
be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is there any such original principle,
which has a prerogative above others, that are self-evident and convincing: Or
if there were, could we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of those very
faculties, of which we are supposed to be already diffident. The ^Cartesian^
doubt, therefore, were it ever possible to be attained by any human creature (as
it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable; and no reasoning could ever
bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject.

{#4,pages=150} It must, however, be confessed, that this species of scepticism,
when more moderate, may be understood in a very reasonable sense, and is a
necessary preparative to the study of philosophy, by preserving a proper
impartiality in our judgments, and weaning our mind from all those prejudices,
which we may have imbibed from education or rash opinion. To begin with clear
and self-evident principles, to advance by timorous and sure steps, to review
frequently our conclusions, and examine accurately all their consequences;
though by these means we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our
systems; are the only methods, by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and
attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations.

{#5,pages=150-1} There is another species of scepticism, _consequent_ to science
and enquiry, when men are supposed to have discovered, either the absolute
fallaciousness of their mental faculties, or their unfitness to reach any fixed
determination in all those curious subjects of speculation, about which they are
commonly employed. Even our very senses are brought into dispute, by a certain
species of philosophers; and the maxims of common life are subjected to the same
doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions of metaphysics and
theology. As these paradoxical tenets |(if they may be called tenets) are to be
met with in some philosophers, and the refutation of them in several, they
naturally excite our curiosity, and make us enquire into the arguments, on which
they may be founded.

{#6,pages=151} I need not insist upon the more trite topics, employed by the
sceptics in all ages, against the evidence of _sense_; such as those which are
derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs, on numberless
occasions; the crooked appearance of an oar in water; the various aspects of
objects, according to their different distances; the double images which arise
from the pressing one eye; with many other appearances of a like nature. These
sceptical topics, indeed, are only sufficient to prove, that the senses alone
are not implicitly to be depended on; but that we must correct their evidence by
reason, and by considerations, derived from the nature of the medium, the
distance of the object, and the disposition of the organ, in order to render
them, within their sphere, the proper _criteria_ of truth and falsehood. There
are other more profound arguments against the senses, which admit not of so easy
a solution.

{#7,pages=151} It seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or
prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any reasoning,
or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe,
which depends not on our perception, but would exist, though we and every
sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creation are
governed by a like opinion, and preserve this belief of external objects, in all
their thoughts, designs, and actions.

{#8,pages=151-2} It seems also evident, that, when men follow this blind and
powerful instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by
the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion, that
the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table, which we
see white, and which we feel hard, is believed to |exist, independent of our
perception, and to be something external to our mind, which perceives it. Our
presence bestows not being on it: Our absence does not annihilate it. It
preserves its existence uniform and entire, independent of the situation of
intelligent beings, who perceive or contemplate it.

{#9,pages=152} But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon
destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever
be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only
the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being able to
produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table,
which we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: But the real
table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: It was, therefore,
nothing but its image, which was present to the mind. These are the obvious
dictates of reason; and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the existences,
which we consider, when we say, _this house_ and _that tree_, are nothing but
perceptions in the mind, and fleeting copies or representations of other
existences, which remain uniform and independent.

{#10,pages=152} So far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or
depart from the primary instincts of nature, and to embrace a new system with
regard to the evidence of our senses. But here philosophy finds herself
extremely embarrassed, when she would justify this new system, and obviate the
cavils and objections of the sceptics. She can no longer plead the infallible
and irresistible instinct of nature: For that led us to a quite different
system, which is acknowledged fallible and even erroneous. And to justify this
pretended philosophical system, by a chain of clear and convincing argument, or
even any appearance of argument, exceeds the power of all human capacity.

{#11,pages=152-3} By what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions |of
the mind must be caused by external objects, entirely different from them,
though resembling them (if that be possible) and could not arise either from the
energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown
spirit, or from some other cause still more unknown to us? It is acknowledged,
that, in fact, many of these perceptions arise not from any thing external, as
in dreams, madness, and other diseases. And nothing can be more inexplicable
than the manner, in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an
image of itself to a substance, supposed of so different, and even contrary a
nature.

{#12,pages=153} It is a question of fact, whether the perceptions of the senses
be produced by external objects, resembling them: How shall this question be
determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like nature. But
here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never any thing
present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of
their connexion with objects. The supposition of such a connexion is, therefore,
without any foundation in reasoning.

{#13,pages=153} To have recourse to the veracity of the supreme Being, in order
to prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected circuit.
If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our senses would be
entirely infallible; because it is not possible that he can ever deceive. Not to
mention, that, if the external world be once called in question, we shall be at
a loss to find arguments, by which we may prove the existence of that Being or
any of his attributes.

{#14,pages=153-4} This is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder and more
philosophical sceptics will always triumph, when they endeavour to introduce an
universal doubt into all subjects of human knowledge and enquiry. Do you follow
the instincts and propensities of nature, may they say, in |assenting to the
veracity of sense? But these lead you to believe, that the very perception or
sensible image is the external object. Do you disclaim this principle, in order
to embrace a more rational opinion, that the perceptions are only
representations of something external? You here depart from your natural
propensities and more obvious sentiments; and yet are not able to satisfy your
reason, which can never find any convincing argument from experience to prove,
that the perceptions are connected with any external objects.

{#15,pages=154-5} There is another sceptical topic of a like nature, derived
from the most profound philosophy; which might merit our attention, were it
requisite to dive so deep, in order to discover arguments and reasonings, which
can so little serve to any serious purpose. It is universally allowed by modern
enquirers, that all the sensible qualities of objects, such as hard, soft, hot,
cold, white, black, _&c._ are merely secondary, and exist not in the objects
themselves, but are perceptions of the mind, without any external archetype or
model, which they represent. If this be allowed, with regard to secondary
qualities, it must also follow, with regard to the supposed primary qualities of
extension and solidity; nor can the latter be any more entitled to that
denomination than the former. The idea of extension is entirely acquired from
the senses of sight and feeling; and if all the qualities, perceived by the
senses, be in the mind, not in the object, the same conclusion must reach the
idea of extension, which is wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas
of secondary qualities. Nothing can save us from this conclusion, but the
asserting, that the ideas of those primary qualities are attained by
_Abstraction_; an opinion, which, if we examine it accurately, we shall find to
be unintelligible, and even absurd. An extension, that is neither tangible nor
visible, cannot possibly be conceived: And a tangible or visible extension,
|which is neither hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the reach of
human conception. Let any man try to conceive a triangle in general, which is
neither _Isosceles_ nor _Scalenum_, nor has any particular length or proportion
of sides; and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the scholastic notions
with regard to abstraction and general ideas[n32].

{#16,pages=155} Thus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense
or to the opinion of external existence consists in this, that such an opinion,
if rested on natural instinct, is contrary to reason, and if referred to reason,
is contrary to natural instinct, and at the same time carries no rational
evidence with it, to convince an impartial enquirer. The second objection goes
farther, and represents this opinion as contrary to reason: at least, if it be a
principle of reason, that all sensible qualities are in the mind, not in the
object.  Bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities, both primary and
secondary, you in a manner annihilate it, and leave only a certain unknown,
inexplicable _something_, as the cause of our perceptions; a notion so
imperfect, that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it.

{#17,pages=155-6} It may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to
destroy _reason_ by argument and ratiocination; yet is this the grand scope of
all their enquiries and disputes. |They endeavour to find objections, both to
our abstract reasonings, and to those which regard matter of fact and existence.

{#18,pages=156-7} The chief objection against all _abstract_ reasonings is
derived from the ideas of space and time; ideas, which, in common life and to a
careless view, are very clear and intelligible, but when they pass through the
scrutiny of the profound sciences (and they are the chief object of these
sciences) afford principles, which seem full of absurdity and contradiction. No
priestly _dogmas_, invented on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason
of mankind, ever shocked common sense more than the doctrine of the infinite
divisibility of extension, with its consequences; as they are pompously
displayed by all geometricians and metaphysicians, with a kind of triumph and
exultation. A real quantity, infinitely less than any finite quantity,
containing quantities infinitely less than itself, and so on _in infinitum_;
this is an edifice so bold and prodigious, that it is too weighty for any
pretended demonstration to support, because it shocks the clearest and most
natural principles of human reason[n33]. But what renders the matter more
extraordinary, is, that these seemingly absurd opinions are supported by a chain
of reasoning, the clearest and most natural; nor is it possible for us to allow
the premises without admitting the consequences. Nothing can be more convincing
and satisfactory than all the conclusions |concerning the properties of circles
and triangles; and yet, when these are once received, how can we deny, that the
angle of contact between a circle and its tangent is infinitely less than any
rectilineal angle, that as you may increase the diameter of the circle _in
infinitum_, this angle of contact becomes still less, even _in infinitum_, and
that the angle of contact between other curves and their tangents may be
infinitely less than those between any circle and its tangent, and so on, _in
infinitum?_ The demonstration of these principles seems as unexceptionable as
that which proves the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones,
though the latter opinion be natural and easy, and the former big with
contradiction and absurdity. Reason here seems to be thrown into a kind of
amazement and suspence, which, without the suggestions of any sceptic, gives her
a diffidence of herself, and of the ground on which she treads. She sees a full
light, which illuminates certain places; but that light borders upon the most
profound darkness. And between these she is so dazzled and confounded, that she
scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assurance concerning any one object.

{#19,pages=157} The absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract
sciences seems to become, if possible, still more palpable with regard to time
than extension. An infinite number of real parts of time, passing in succession,
and exhausted one after another, appears so evident a contradiction, that no
man, one should think, whose judgment is not corrupted, instead of being
improved, by the sciences, would ever be able to admit of it.

{#20,pages=157-8} Yet still reason must remain restless, and unquiet, even with
regard to that scepticism, to which she is driven by these seeming absurdities
and contradictions. How any clear, distinct idea can contain circumstances,
contradictory to itself, or to any other clear, distinct idea, is absolutely
incomprehensible; and is, perhaps, as absurd as any |proposition, which can be
formed. So that nothing can be more sceptical, or more full of doubt and
hesitation, than this scepticism itself, which arises from some of the
paradoxical conclusions of geometry or the science of quantity[n34].

{#21,pages=158-9} The sceptical objections to _moral_ evidence, or to the
reasonings concerning matter of fact, are either _popular_ or _philosophical_.
The popular objections are derived from the natural weakness of human
understanding; the contradictory opinions, which have been entertained in
different ages and nations; the variations of our judgment in sickness and
health, youth and old age, prosperity and adversity; the perpetual contradiction
of each particular man's opinions and sentiments; with many other topics of that
kind. It is needless to insist farther on this head. These objections are but
weak. For as, in common life, we reason every moment concerning fact and
existence, and cannot possibly subsist, without continually employing this
species of argument, any popular objections, derived from thence, must be
insufficient to destroy that evidence. The great subverter of _Pyrrhonism_ or
the excessive principles of |scepticism, is action, and employment, and the
occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the
schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But
as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which
actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful
principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined
sceptic in the same condition as other mortals.

{#22,pages=159} The sceptic, therefore, had better keep within his proper
sphere, and display those _philosophical_ objections, which arise from more
profound researches. Here he seems to have ample matter of triumph; while he
justly insists, that all our evidence for any matter of fact, which lies beyond
the testimony of sense or memory, is derived entirely from the relation of cause
and effect; that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two
objects, which have been frequently _conjoined_ together; that we have no
argument to convince us, that objects, which have, in our experience, been
frequently conjoined, will likewise, in other instances, be conjoined in the
same manner; and that nothing leads us to this inference but custom or a certain
instinct of our nature; which it is indeed difficult to resist, but which, like
other instincts, may be fallacious and deceitful. While the sceptic insists upon
these topics, he shews his force, or rather, indeed, his own and our weakness;
and seems, for the time at least, to destroy all assurance and conviction. These
arguments might be displayed at greater length, if any durable good or benefit
to society could ever be expected to result from them.

{#23,pages=159-60} For here is the chief and most confounding objection to
_excessive_ scepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it
remains in its full force and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic, _What his
meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches?_ He is
|immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer. A ^Copernican^ or
^Ptolemaic^, who supports each his different system of astronomy, may hope to
produce a conviction, which will remain constant and durable, with his audience.
A ^Stoic^ or ^Epicurean^ displays principles, which may not only be durable, but
which have an effect on conduct and behaviour. But a ^Pyrrhonian^ cannot expect,
that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: Or if it had,
that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must
acknowledge, if he will acknowledge any thing, that all human life must perish,
were his principles universally and steadily to prevail. All discourse, all
action would immediately cease; and men remain in a total lethargy, till the
necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end to their miserable existence. It
is true; so fatal an event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too
strong for principle. And though a ^Pyrrhonian^ may throw himself or others into
a momentary amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings; the first and
most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and scruples, and
leave him the same, in every point of action and speculation, with the
philosophers of every other sect, or with those who never concerned themselves
in any philosophical researches. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the
first to join in the laugh against himself, and to confess, that all his
objections are mere amusement, and can have no other tendency than to show the
whimsical condition of mankind, who must act and reason and believe; though they
are not able, by their most diligent enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning
the foundation of these operations, or to remove the objections, which may be
raised against them.

{#24,pages=161-2} There is, indeed, a more _mitigated_ scepticism or
_academical_ philosophy, which may be both durable and useful, and which may, in
part, be the result of this ^Pyrrhonism^, or _excessive_ scepticism, when its
undistinguished doubts are, in some measure, corrected by common sense and
reflection. The greater part of mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and
dogmatical in their opinions; and while they see objects only on one side, and
have no idea of any counterpoising argument, they throw themselves precipitately
into the principles, to which they are inclined; nor have they any indulgence
for those who entertain opposite sentiments. To hesitate or balance perplexes
their understanding, checks their passion, and suspends their action. They are,
therefore, impatient till they escape from a state, which to them is so uneasy;
and they think, that they can never remove themselves far enough from it, by the
violence of their affirmations and obstinacy of their belief. But could such
dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange infirmities of human
understanding, even in its most perfect state, and when most accurate and
cautious in its determinations; such a reflection would naturally inspire them
with more modesty and reserve, and diminish their fond opinion of themselves,
and their prejudice against antagonists. The illiterate may reflect on the
disposition of the learned, who, amidst all the advantages of study and
reflection, are commonly still diffident in their determinations: And if any of
the learned be inclined, from their natural temper, to haughtiness and
obstinacy, a small tincture of ^Pyrrhonism^ might abate their pride, by shewing
them, that the few advantages, which they may have attained over their fellows,
are but inconsiderable, if compared with the universal perplexity and confusion,
which is inherent in human nature. In |general, there is a degree of doubt, and
caution, and modesty, which, in all kinds of scrutiny and decision, ought for
ever to accompany a just reasoner.

{#25,pages=162} Another species of _mitigated_ scepticism, which may be of
advantage to mankind, and which may be the natural result of the ^Pyrrhonian^
doubts and scruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to such subjects as are
best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding. The _imagination_ of
man is naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is remote and extraordinary,
and running, without controul, into the most distant parts of space and time in
order to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered too familiar to it. A
correct _Judgment_ observes a contrary method, and avoiding all distant and high
enquiries, confines itself to common life, and to such subjects as fall under
daily practice and experience; leaving the more sublime topics to the
embellishment of poets and orators, or to the arts of priests and politicians.
To bring us to so salutary a determination, nothing can be more serviceable,
than to be once thoroughly convinced of the force of the ^Pyrrhonian^ doubt, and
of the impossibility, that any thing, but the strong power of natural instinct,
could free us from it. Those who have a propensity to philosophy, will still
continue their researches; because they reflect, that, besides the immediate
pleasure, attending such an occupation, philosophical decisions are nothing but
the reflections of common life, methodized and corrected. But they will never be
tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the imperfection of
those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach, and their inaccurate
operations. While we cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe, after a
thousand experiments, that a stone will fall, or fire burn; can we ever satisfy
ourselves concerning any determination, which we may form, with regard to the
origin of worlds, and the situation of nature, from, and to eternity?

{#26,pages=163} This narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries, is, in every
respect, so reasonable, that it suffices to make the slightest examination into
the natural powers of the human mind, and to compare them with their objects, in
order to recommend it to us. We shall then find what are the proper subjects of
science and enquiry.

{#27,pages=163} It seems to me, that the only objects of the abstract sciences
or of demonstration are quantity and number, and that all attempts to extend
this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry
and illusion. As the component parts of quantity and number are entirely
similar, their relations become intricate and involved; and nothing can be more
curious, as well as useful, than to trace, by a variety of mediums, their
equality or inequality, through their different appearances. But as all other
ideas are clearly distinct and different from each other, we can never advance
farther, by our outmost scrutiny, than to observe this diversity, and, by an
obvious reflection, pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there be any
difficulty in these decisions, it proceeds entirely from the undeterminate
meaning of words, which is corrected by juster definitions. That _the square of
the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides_, cannot be
known, let the terms be ever so exactly defined, without a train of reasoning
and enquiry. But to convince us of this proposition, _that where there is no
property, there can be no injustice_, it is only necessary to define the terms,
and explain injustice to be a violation of property. This proposition is,
indeed, nothing but a more imperfect definition. It is the same case with all
those pretended syllogistical reasonings, which may be found in every other
branch of learning, except the sciences of quantity and number; and these may
safely, I think, be pronounced the only proper objects of knowledge and
demonstration.

{#28,pages=163-4} All other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and
|existence; and these are evidently incapable of demonstration. Whatever _is_
may _not be_. No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction. The
non-existence of any being, without exception, is as clear and distinct an idea
as its existence. The proposition, which affirms it not to be, however false, is
no less conceivable and intelligible, than that which affirms it to be. The case
is different with the sciences, properly so called. Every proposition, which is
not true, is there confused and unintelligible. That the cube root of 64 is
equal to the half of 10, is a false proposition, and can never be distinctly
conceived. But that ^C{ae}sar^, or the angel ^Gabriel^, or any being never
existed, may be a false proposition, but still is perfectly conceivable, and
implies no contradiction.

{#29,pages=164} The existence, therefore, of any being can only be proved by
arguments from its cause or its effect; and these arguments are founded entirely
on experience. If we reason _à priori_, any thing may appear able to produce any
thing. The falling of a pebble may, for ought we know, extinguish the sun; or
the wish of a man controul the planets in their orbits. It is only experience,
which teaches us the nature and bounds of cause and effect, and enables us to
infer the existence of one object from that of another[n35]. Such is the
foundation of moral reasoning, which forms the greater part of human knowledge,
and is the source of all human action and behaviour.

{#30,pages=164} Moral reasonings are either concerning particular or general
facts. All deliberations in life regard the former; as also all disquisitions in
history, chronology, geography, and astronomy.

{#31,pages=165} The sciences, which treat of general facts, are politics,
natural philosophy, physic, chymistry, _&c._ where the qualities, causes and
effects of a whole species of objects are enquired into.

{#32,pages=165} Divinity or Theology, as it proves the existence of a Deity, and
the immortality of souls, is composed partly of reasonings concerning
particular, partly concerning general facts. It has a foundation in _reason_, so
far as it is supported by experience. But its best and most solid foundation is
_faith_ and divine revelation.

{#33,pages=165} Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the
understanding as of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is
felt, more properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it, and endeavour
to fix its standard, we regard a new fact, to wit, the general taste of mankind,
or some such fact, which may be the object of reasoning and enquiry.

{#34,pages=165} When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what
havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school
metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, _Does it contain any abstract reasoning
concerning quantity or number?_ No. _Does it contain any experimental reasoning
concerning matter of fact and existence?_ No. Commit it then to the flames: For
it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

{#n32,pages=155} See NOTE [N].

{#n32.1,pages=155} THIS argument is drawn from Dr. ^Berkley^; and indeed most of
the writings of that very ingenious author form the best lessons of scepticism,
which are to be found either among the ancient or modern philosophers, ^Bayle^
not excepted. He professes, however, in his title-page (and undoubtedly with
great truth) to have composed his book against the sceptics as well as against
the atheists and free-thinkers. But that all his arguments, though otherwise
intended, are, in reality, merely sceptical, appears from this, _that they admit
of no answer and produce no conviction_. Their only effect is to cause that
momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion, which is the result of
scepticism.

{#n33,pages=156} See NOTE [O].

{#n33.1,pages=156} WHATEVER disputes there may be about mathematical points, we
must allow that there are physical points; that is, parts of extension, which
cannot be divided or lessened, either by the eye or imagination. These images,
then, which are present to the fancy or senses, are absolutely indivisible, and
consequently must be allowed by mathematicians to be infinitely less than any
real part of extension; and yet nothing appears more certain to reason, than
that an infinite number of them composes an infinite extension. How much more an
infinite number of those infinitely small parts of extension, which are still
supposed infinitely divisible.

{#n34,pages=158} See NOTE [P].

{#n34.1,pages=158} IT seems to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities and
contradictions, if it be admitted, that there is no such thing as abstract or
general ideas, properly speaking; but that all general ideas are, in reality,
particular ones, attached to a general term, which recalls, upon occasion, other
particular ones, that resemble, in certain circumstances, the idea, present to
the mind. Thus when the term Horse is pronounced, we immediately figure to
ourselves the idea of a black or a white animal, of a particular size or figure:
But as that term is also usually applied to animals of other colours, figures
and sizes, these ideas, though not actually present to the imagination, are
easily recalled; and our reasoning and conclusion proceed in the same way, as if
they were actually present. If this be admitted (as seems reasonable) it follows
that all the ideas of quantity, upon which mathematicians reason, are nothing
but particular, and such as are suggested by the senses and imagination, and
consequently, cannot be infinitely divisible. It is sufficient to have dropped
this hint at present, without prosecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns
all lovers of science not to expose themselves to the ridicule and contempt of
the ignorant by their conclusions; and this seems the readiest solution of these
difficulties.

{#n35,pages=164} See NOTE [Q].

{#n35.1,pages=164} THAT impious maxim of the ancient philosophy, _Ex nihilo,
nihil fit_, by which the creation of matter was excluded, ceases to be a maxim,
according to this philosophy. Not only the will of the supreme Being may create
matter; but, for aught we know _à priori_, the will of any other being might
create it, or any other cause, that the most whimsical imagination can assign.
