{#1,pages=132} I WAS lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves
sceptical paradoxes; where, though he advanced many principles, of which I can
by no means approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear some relation
to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this enquiry, I shall here copy
them from my memory as accurately as I can, in order to submit them to the
judgment of the reader.

{#2,pages=132-3} Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good
fortune of philosophy, which, as it requires entire liberty above all other
privileges, and chiefly flourishes from the free opposition of sentiments and
argumentation, received its first birth in an age and country of freedom and
toleration, and was never cramped, even in its most extravagant principles, by
any creeds, confessions, or penal statutes. For, except the banishment of
^Protagoras^, and the death of ^Socrates^, which last event proceeded partly
from other motives, there are scarcely any instances to be met with, in ancient
history, of this bigotted jealousy, with which the present age is so much
infested. ^Epicurus^ lived at ^Athens^ to an advanced age, in peace and
tranquillity: ^Epicureans^[n28] were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal
character, and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred rites of the
established religion: And the public encouragement[n29] of pensions and
|salaries was afforded equally, by the wisest of all the ^Roman^ emperors[n30],
to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How requisite such kind of
treatment was to philosophy, in her early youth, will easily be conceived, if we
reflect, that, even at present, when she may be supposed more hardy and robust,
she bears with much difficulty the inclemency of the seasons, and those harsh
winds of calumny and persecution, which blow upon her.

{#3,pages=133} You admire, says my friend, as the singular good fortune of
philosophy, what seems to result from the natural course of things, and to be
unavoidable in every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of which you
complain, as so fatal to philosophy, is really her offspring, who, after allying
with superstition, separates himself entirely from the interest of his parent,
and becomes her most inveterate enemy and persecutor. Speculative dogmas of
religion, the present occasions of such furious dispute, could not possibly be
conceived or admitted in the early ages of the world; when mankind, being wholly
illiterate, formed an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension,
and composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as were the objects of
traditional belief, more than of argument or disputation. After the first alarm,
therefore, was over, which arose from the new paradoxes and principles of the
philosophers; these teachers seem ever after, during the ages of antiquity, to
have lived in great harmony with the established superstition, and to have made
a fair partition of mankind between them; the former claiming all the learned
and wise, the latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.

{#4,pages=133-4} It seems then, say I, that you leave politics entirely out of
the question, and never suppose, that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of
certain tenets of philosophy, such as those of ^Epicurus^, which, denying a
divine existence, and consequently a providence and a future state, seem to
loosen, |in a great measure, the ties of morality, and may be supposed, for that
reason, pernicious to the peace of civil society.

{#5,pages=134} I know, replied he, that in fact these persecutions never, in any
age, proceeded from calm reason, or from experience of the pernicious
consequences of philosophy; but arose entirely from passion and prejudice. But
what if I should advance farther, and assert, that, if ^Epicurus^ had been
accused before the people, by any of the _sycophants_ or informers of those
days, he could easily have defended his cause, and proved his principles of
philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries, who endeavoured, with
such zeal, to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy?

{#6,pages=134} I wish, said I, you would try your eloquence upon so
extraordinary a topic, and make a speech for ^Epicurus^, which might satisfy,
not the mob of ^Athens^, if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have
contained any mob, but the more philosophical part of his audience, such as
might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.

{#7,pages=134} The matter would not be difficult, upon such conditions, replied
he: And if you please, I shall suppose myself ^Epicurus^ for a moment, and make
you stand for the ^Athenian^ people, and shall deliver you such an harangue as
will fill all the urn with white beans, and leave not a black one to gratify the
malice of my adversaries.

{#8,pages=134} Very well: Pray proceed upon these suppositions.

{#9,pages=134-5} I come hither, O ye ^Athenians^, to justify in your assembly
what I maintained in my school, and I find myself impeached by furious
antagonists, instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers. Your
deliberations, which of right should be directed to questions of public good,
and the interest of the commonwealth, are diverted to the disquisitions of
speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but perhaps fruitless enquiries,
take place of your more familiar |but more useful occupations. But so far as in
me lies, I will prevent this abuse. We shall not here dispute concerning the
origin and government of worlds. We shall only enquire how far such questions
concern the public interest. And if I can persuade you, that they are entirely
indifferent to the peace of society and security of government, I hope that you
will presently send us back to our schools, there to examine, at leisure, the
question, the most sublime, but, at the same time, the most speculative of all
philosophy.

{#10,pages=135} The religious philosophers, not satisfied with the tradition of
your forefathers, and doctrine of your priests (in which I willingly acquiesce),
indulge a rash curiosity, in trying how far they can establish religion upon the
principles of reason; and they thereby excite, instead of satisfying, the
doubts, which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry. They
paint, in the most magnificent colours, the order, beauty, and wise arrangement
of the universe; and then ask, if such a glorious display of intelligence could
proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms, or if chance could produce what
the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire. I shall not examine the
justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and
accusers can desire. It is sufficient, if I can prove, from this very reasoning,
that the question is entirely speculative, and that, when, in my philosophical
disquisitions, I deny a providence and a future state, I undermine not the
foundations of society, but advance principles, which they themselves, upon
their own topics, if they argue consistently, must allow to be solid and
satisfactory.

{#11,pages=135-6} You then, who are my accusers, have acknowledged, that the
chief or sole argument for a divine existence (which I never questioned) is
derived from the order of nature; where there appear such marks of intelligence
and design, that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause, either
chance, or the blind and unguided force of matter. You allow, that this |is an
argument drawn from effects to causes. From the order of the work, you infer,
that there must have been project and forethought in the workman. If you cannot
make out this point, you allow, that your conclusion fails; and you pretend not
to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the ph{ae}nomena of
nature will justify. These are your concessions. I desire you to mark the
consequences.

{#12,pages=136} When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must
proportion the one to the other, and can never be allowed to ascribe to the
cause any qualities, but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect. A
body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof, that the
counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces; but can never afford a reason that
it exceeds a hundred. If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient
to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as
will give it a just proportion to the effect. But if we ascribe to it farther
qualities, or affirm it capable of producing other effects, we can only indulge
the licence of conjecture, and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities
and energies, without reason or authority.

{#13,pages=136-7} The same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be brute
unconscious matter, or a rational intelligent being. If the cause be known only
by the effect, we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities, beyond what are
precisely requisite to produce the effect: Nor can we, by any rules of just
reasoning, return back from the cause, and infer other effects from it, beyond
those by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely from the sight of one of
^Zeuxis's^ pictures, could know, that he was also a statuary or architect, and
was an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colours. The talents
and taste, displayed in the particular work before us; these we may safely
conclude the workman to be possessed of. The cause must be proportioned to the
effect; and if |we exactly and precisely proportion it, we shall never find in
it any qualities, that point farther, or afford an inference concerning any
other design or performance. Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what is
merely requisite for producing the effect, which we examine.

{#14,pages=137} Allowing, therefore, the gods to be the authors of the existence
or order of the universe; it follows, that they possess that precise degree of
power, intelligence, and benevolence, which appears in their workmanship; but
nothing farther can ever be proved, except we call in the assistance of
exaggeration and flattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning. So
far as the traces of any attributes, at present, appear, so far may we conclude
these attributes to exist. The supposition of farther attributes is mere
hypothesis; much more the supposition, that, in distant regions of space or
periods of time, there has been, or will be, a more magnificent display of these
attributes, and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary
virtues. We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe, the effect, to
^Jupiter^, the cause; and then descend downwards, to infer any new effect from
that cause; as if the present effects alone were not entirely worthy of the
glorious attributes, which we ascribe to that deity. The knowledge of the cause
being derived solely from the effect, they must be exactly adjusted to each
other; and the one can never refer to any thing farther, or be the foundation of
any new inference and conclusion.

{#15,pages=137-8} You find certain ph{ae}nomena in nature. You seek a cause or
author. You imagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamoured
of this offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he must
produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things,
which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this superlative
intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or, at least, without any
|foundation in reason; and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any
qualities, but what you see he has actually exerted and displayed in his
productions. Let your gods, therefore, O philosophers, be suited to the present
appearances of nature: And presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary
suppositions, in order to suit them to the attributes, which you so fondly
ascribe to your deities.

{#16,pages=138} When priests and poets, supported by your authority, O
^Athenians^, talk of a golden or silver age, which preceded the present state of
vice and misery, I hear them with attention and with reverence. But when
philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority, and to cultivate reason, hold
the same discourse, I pay them not, I own, the same obsequious submission and
pious deference. I ask; who carried them into the celestial regions, who
admitted them into the councils of the gods, who opened to them the book of
fate, that they thus rashly affirm, that their deities have executed, or will
execute, any purpose beyond what has actually appeared? If they tell me, that
they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason, and by
drawing inferences from effects to causes, I still insist, that they have aided
the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination; otherwise they could not thus
change their manner of inference, and argue from causes to effects; presuming,
that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to
such perfect beings as the gods, and forgetting that they have no reason to
ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute, but what can
be found in the present world.

{#17,pages=138-9} Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill
appearances of nature, and save the honour of the gods; while we must
acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder, with which the world so much
abounds. The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter, we are told, |or the
observance of general laws, or some such reason, is the sole cause, which
controlled the power and benevolence of ^Jupiter^, and obliged him to create
mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy. These
attributes, then, are, it seems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their
greatest latitude. And upon that supposition, I own, that such conjectures may,
perhaps, be admitted as plausible solutions of the ill ph{ae}nomena. But still I
ask; Why take these attributes for granted, or why ascribe to the cause any
qualities but what actually appear in the effect? Why torture your brain to
justify the course of nature upon suppositions, which, for aught you know, may
be entirely imaginary, and of which there are to be found no traces in the
course of nature?

{#18,pages=139} The religious hypothesis, therefore, must be considered only as
a particular method of accounting for the visible ph{ae}nomena of the universe:
But no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact, and
alter or add to the ph{ae}nomena, in any single particular. If you think, that
the appearances of things prove such causes, it is allowable for you to draw an
inference concerning the existence of these causes. In such complicated and
sublime subjects, every one should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and
argument. But here you ought to rest. If you come backward, and arguing from
your inferred causes, conclude, that any other fact has existed, or will exist,
in the course of nature, which may serve as a fuller display of particular
attributes; I must admonish you, that you have departed from the method of
reasoning, attached to the present subject, and have certainly added something
to the attributes of the cause, beyond what appears in the effect; otherwise you
could never, with tolerable sense or propriety, add any thing to the effect, in
order to render it more worthy of the cause.

{#19,pages=139-40} Where, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine, which |I
teach in my school, or rather, which I examine in my gardens? Or what do you
find in this whole question, wherein the security of good morals, or the peace
and order of society is in the least concerned?

{#20,pages=140-1} I deny a providence, you say, and supreme governour of the
world, who guides the course of events, and punishes the vicious with infamy and
disappointment, and rewards the virtuous with honour and success, in all their
undertakings. But surely, I deny not the course itself of events, which lies
open to every one's enquiry and examination. I acknowledge, that, in the present
order of things, virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice, and meets
with a more favourable reception from the world. I am sensible, that, according
to the past experience of mankind, friendship is the chief joy of human life,
and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance
between the virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sensible, that, to a
well disposed mind, every advantage is on the side of the former. And what can
you say more, allowing all your suppositions and reasonings? You tell me,
indeed, that this disposition of things proceeds from intelligence and design.
But whatever it proceeds from, the disposition itself, on which depends our
happiness or misery, and consequently our conduct and deportment in life, is
still the same. It is still open for me, as well as you, to regulate my
behaviour, by my experience of past events. And if you affirm, that, while a
divine providence is allowed, and a supreme distributive justice in the
universe, I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good, and
punishment of the bad, beyond the ordinary course of events; I here find the
same fallacy, which I have before endeavoured to detect. You persist in
imagining, that, if we grant that divine existence, for which you so earnestly
contend, you may safely infer consequences from it, and add something |to the
experienced order of nature, by arguing from the attributes which you ascribe to
your gods. You seem not to remember, that all your reasonings on this subject
can only be drawn from effects to causes; and that every argument, deduced from
causes to effects, must of necessity be a gross sophism; since it is impossible
for you to know any thing of the cause, but what you have antecedently, not
inferred, but discovered to the full, in the effect.

{#21,pages=141} But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners, who,
instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of their
contemplation, so far reverse the whole course of nature, as to render this life
merely a passage to something farther; a porch, which leads to a greater, and
vastly different building; a prologue, which serves only to introduce the piece,
and give it more grace and propriety? Whence, do you think, can such
philosophers derive their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and
imagination surely. For if they derived it from the present ph{ae}nomena, it
would never point to any thing farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them.
That the divinity may _possibly_ be endowed with attributes, which we have never
seen exerted; may be governed by principles of action, which we cannot discover
to be satisfied: All this will freely be allowed. But still this is mere
_possibility_ and hypothesis. We never can have reason to _infer_ any
attributes, or any principles of action in him, but so far as we know them to
have been exerted and satisfied.

{#22,pages=141-2} _Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world?_
If you answer in the affirmative, I conclude, that, since justice here exerts
itself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have
then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it, to the gods. If you hold
a medium between affirmation and negation, by |saying, that the justice of the
gods, at present, exerts itself in part, but not in its full extent; I answer,
that you have no reason to give it any particular extent, but only so far as you
see it, _at present_, exert itself.

{#23,pages=142} Thus I bring the dispute, O ^Athenians^, to a short issue with
my antagonists. The course of nature lies open to my contemplation as well as to
theirs. The experienced train of events is the great standard, by which we all
regulate our conduct. Nothing else can be appealed to in the field, or in the
senate. Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in the school, or in the closet.
In vain would our limited understanding break through those boundaries, which
are too narrow for our fond imagination. While we argue from the course of
nature, and infer a particular intelligent cause, which first bestowed, and
still preserves order in the universe, we embrace a principle, which is both
uncertain and useless. It is uncertain; because the subject lies entirely beyond
the reach of human experience. It is useless; because our knowledge of this
cause being derived entirely from the course of nature, we can never, according
to the rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause with any new
inference, or making additions to the common and experienced course of nature,
establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour.

{#24,pages=142-3} I observe (said I, finding he had finished his harangue) that
you neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old; and as you were pleased
to make me stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my favour by
embracing those principles, to which, you know, I have always expressed a
particular attachment. But allowing you to make experience (as indeed I think
you ought) the only standard of our judgment concerning this, and all other
questions of fact; I doubt not but, from the very same experience, to which you
appeal, it may be possible to |refute this reasoning, which you have put into
the mouth of ^Epicurus^. If you saw, for instance, a half-finished building,
surrounded with heaps of brick and stone and mortar, and all the instruments of
masonry; could you not _infer_ from the effect, that it was a work of design and
contrivance? And could you not return again, from this inferred cause, to infer
new additions to the effect, and conclude, that the building would soon be
finished, and receive all the further improvements, which art could bestow upon
it? If you saw upon the sea-shore the print of one human foot, you would
conclude, that a man had passed that way, and that he had also left the traces
of the other foot, though effaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of
the waters. Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with
regard to the order of nature? Consider the world and the present life only as
an imperfect building, from which you can infer a superior intelligence; and
arguing from that superior intelligence, which can leave nothing imperfect; why
may you not infer a more finished scheme or plan, which will receive its
completion in some distant point of space or time? Are not these methods of
reasoning exactly similar? And under what pretence can you embrace the one,
while you reject the other?

{#25,pages=143-4} The infinite difference of the subjects, replied he, is a
sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions. In works of _human_
art and contrivance, it is allowable to advance from the effect to the cause,
and returning back from the cause, to form new inferences concerning the effect,
and examine the alterations, which it has probably undergone, or may still
undergo. But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning? Plainly this;
that man is a being, whom we know by experience, whose motives and designs we
are acquainted with, and whose projects and inclinations have a certain
connexion and |coherence, according to the laws which nature has established for
the government of such a creature. When, therefore, we find, that any work has
proceeded from the skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise acquainted
with the nature of the animal, we can draw a hundred inferences concerning what
may be expected from him; and these inferences will all be founded in experience
and observation. But did we know man only from the single work or production
which we examine, it were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because our
knowledge of all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in that case
derived from the production, it is impossible they could point to any thing
farther, or be the foundation of any new inference. The print of a foot in the
sand can only prove, when considered alone, that there was some figure adapted
to it, by which it was produced: But the print of a human foot proves likewise,
from our other experience, that there was probably another foot, which also left
its impression, though effaced by time or other accidents. Here we mount from
the effect to the cause; and descending again from the cause, infer alterations
in the effect; but this is not a continuation of the same simple chain of
reasoning. We comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and
observations, concerning the _usual_ figure and members of that species of
animal, without which this method of argument must be considered as fallacious
and sophistical.

{#26,pages=144-5} The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of
nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single being
in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus, from whose
experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy, infer any attribute or
quality in him. As the universe shews wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and
goodness. As it shews a particular degree of these perfections, |we infer a
particular degree of them, precisely adapted to the effect which we examine. But
farther attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes, we can never be
authorised to infer or suppose, by any rules of just reasoning. Now, without
some such licence of supposition, it is impossible for us to argue from the
cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen
under our observation. Greater good produced by this Being must still prove a
greater degree of goodness: A more impartial distribution of rewards and
punishments must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity. Every
supposed addition to the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of
the Author of nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any reason
or argument, can never be admitted but as mere conjecture and hypothesis[n31].

{#27,pages=145-7} The great source of our mistake in this subject, and of the
unbounded licence of conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly consider
ourselves, as in the place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he will, on
every |occasion, observe the same conduct, which we ourselves, in his situation,
would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But, besides that the ordinary
course of nature may convince us, that almost every thing is regulated by
principles and maxims very different from ours; besides this, I say, it must
evidently appear contrary to all rules of analogy to reason, from the intentions
and projects of men, to those of a Being so different, and so much superior. In
human nature, there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and
inclinations; so that when, from any fact, we have discovered one intention of
any man, it may often be reasonable, from experience, to infer another, and draw
a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this
method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being, so remote and
incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe
than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers himself only by some faint
traces or outlines, beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any
attribute or perfection. What we imagine to be a superior perfection, may really
be a defect. Or were it ever so much a perfection, the ascribing of it to the
Supreme Being, where it appears not to have been really exerted, to the full, in
his works, savours more of flattery and panegyric, than of just reasoning and
sound philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, in the world, and all the
religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be able to
carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us measures of conduct
and behaviour different from those which are furnished by reflections on common
life. No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis; no event
foreseen or foretold; no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what
is already known by practice and observation. So that my apology for ^Epicurus^
will still appear solid and |satisfactory; nor have the political interests of
society any connexion with the philosophical disputes concerning metaphysics and
religion.

{#28,pages=147} There is still one circumstance, replied I, which you seem to
have overlooked. Though I should allow your premises, I must deny your
conclusion. You conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings _can_ have no
influence on life, because they _ought_ to have no influence; never considering,
that men reason not in the same manner you do, but draw many consequences from
the belief of a divine Existence, and suppose that the Deity will inflict
punishments on vice, and bestow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in the
ordinary course of nature. Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not, is
no matter. Its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And,
those, who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may, for aught I know,
be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians;
since they free men from one restraint upon their passions, and make the
infringement of the laws of society, in one respect, more easy and secure.

{#29,pages=147} After all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general conclusion in
favour of liberty, though upon different premises from those, on which you
endeavour to found it. I think, that the state ought to tolerate every principle
of philosophy; nor is there an instance, that any government has suffered in its
political interests by such indulgence. There is no enthusiasm among
philosophers; their doctrines are not very alluring to the people; and no
restraint can be put upon their reasonings, but what must be of dangerous
consequence to the sciences, and even to the state, by paving the way for
persecution and oppression in points, where the generality of mankind are more
deeply interested and concerned.

{#30,pages=147-8} But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your |main
topic, a difficulty, which I shall just propose to you, without insisting on it;
lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a word, I
much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its effect (as
you have all along supposed) or to be of so singular and particular a nature as
to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object, that has
ever fallen under our observation. It is only when two _species_ of objects are
found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and
were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be
comprehended under any known _species_, I do not see, that we could form any
conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience and
observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably
follow in inferences of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a
similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes, which we know, and which
we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to
your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle. I shall just
observe, that, as the antagonists of ^Epicurus^ always suppose the universe, an
effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no
less singular and unparalleled; your reasonings, upon that supposition, seem, at
least, to merit our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how we can ever
return from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our ideas of the
former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any addition to it.

{#n30,pages=133} Id. & Dio.

{#n31,pages=145} See NOTE [M].

{#n31.1,pages=145} IN general, it may, I think, be established as a maxim, that
where any cause is known only by its particular effects, it must be impossible
to infer any new effects from that cause; since the qualities, which are
requisite to produce these new effects along with the former, must either be
different, or superior, or of more extensive operation, than those which simply
produced the effect, whence alone the cause is supposed to be known to us. We
can never, therefore, have any reason to suppose the existence of these
qualities. To say, that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the
same energy, which is already known from the first effects, will not remove the
difficulty. For even granting this to be the case (which can seldom be
supposed), the very continuation and exertion of a like energy (for it is
impossible it can be absolutely the same), I say, this exertion of a like
energy, in a different period of space and time, is a very arbitrary
supposition, and what there cannot possibly be any traces of in the effects,
from which all our knowledge of the cause is originally derived. Let the
_inferred_ cause be exactly proportioned (as it should be) to the known effect;
and it is impossible that it can possess any qualities, from which new or
different effects can be _inferred_.
