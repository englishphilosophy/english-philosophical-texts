  John Clarke’s [Examination of the Notion of Moral Good and Evil] is an attack
  on William Wollaston’s [Religion of Nature
  Delineated](https://englishphilosophy.org/texts/wollaston/rnd). The text here
  derives from Stanley Tweyman’s edition of the latter (Delmar, New York:
  Scholars’ Facsimiles and Reprints), which includes Clarke’s criticism, as well
  as an anonymous defence of Wollaston written in response to Clarke (also
  published in 1725; Wollaston himself died in 1724).
