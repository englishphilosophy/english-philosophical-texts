£2 _No innate practical Principles._ £2

{#1} IF those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the fore-going
Chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all Mankind, as we there
proved, it is much more visible concerning _practical Principles,_ that they
_come short of an universal Reception_: and I think it will be hard to instance
any one moral Rule, which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as,
_What is, is,_ or to be so manifest a Truth as this, _That it is impossible for
the same thing to be, and not to be._ Whereby it is evident, That they are
farther removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native
Impressions on the Mind, is stronger against these moral Principles than the
other. Not that it brings their Truth at all in question. They are equally true,
though not equally evident. Those speculative Maxims carry their own Evidence
with them: but moral Principles require Reasoning and Discourse, and some
Exercise of the Mind, to discover the Certainty of their Truth. They lie not
open as natural Characters ingraven on the Mind; which if any such were, they
must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known
to every Body. But this is no Derogation to their Truth and Certainty, no more
than it is to the Truth or Certainty of the Three Angles of a Triangle being
equal to two right ones, because it is not so evident as _The whole is bigger
than a part_; nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice,
that these moral Rules are capable of Demonstration: and therefore it is our own
faults, if we come not to a certain Knowledge of them. But the Ignorance wherein
many Men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them,
are manifest Proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to
their view without searching.

{#2} Whether there be any such moral Principles, wherein all Men do agree, I
appeal to any, who have been but moderately conversant in the History of
Mankind, and look'd abroad beyond the Smoak of their own Chimneys. Where is that
practical Truth, that is universally received without doubt or question, as it
must be if innate? _Iustice,_ and keeping of Contracts, is, that which _most Men
seem to agree in._ This is a Principle, which is thought to extend it self to
the Dens of Thieves, and the Troops of Robbers; and they who have gone farthest
towards the putting off of Humanity it self, keep Faith and Rules of Justice one
with another. I grant that Outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but
'tis, without receiving these as the innate Laws of Nature. They practice them
as Rules of convenience within their own Communities: But it is impossible to
conceive, that he imbraces Justice as a practical Principle, who acts fairly
with his Fellow-High-way-men, and at the same time plunders or kills the next
honest Man he meets with. Justice and Truth are the common ties of Society; and
therefore, even Outlaws and Villains, who break with all the World besides, must
keep Faith and Rules of Equity amongst themselves, or else they cannot hold
together. But will any one say, That those that live by Fraud and Rapine, have
innate Principles of Truth and Justice, which they allow and assent to?

{#3} Perhaps it will be urged, That the _tacit assent of their Minds agrees to
what their Practice contradicts._ I answer, _First,_ I have always thought the
Actions of Men the best Interpreters of their thoughts. But since it is certain,
that most Men's Practice, and some Men's open Professions, have either
questioned or denied these Principles, it is impossible to establish an
universal consent (though we should look for it only amongst grown Men) without
which, it is impossible to conclude them innate. _Secondly,_ 'Tis very strange
and unreasonable, to suppose innate practical Principles, that terminate only in
Contemplation. Practical Principles, derived from Nature, are there for
Operation, and must produce Conformity of Action, not barely speculative assent
to their truth, or else they are in vain destinguish'd from speculative Maxims.
Nature, I confess, has put into Man a desire of Happiness, and an aversion to
Misery: These indeed are innate practical Principles, which (as practical
Principles ought) do continue constantly, to operate and influence all our
Actions, without ceasing: These may be observed in all Persons and all Ages,
steady and universal; but these are Inclinations of the Will and Appetite, not
Impressions and Characters on the Understanding. I deny not, that there are
natural tendencies imprinted on the Minds of Men; and that, from the very first
instances of sense and perception, there are some things that are grateful, and
others unwelcome to them; some things that they incline to, and others that they
fly: But this makes nothing for innate Characters on the Mind, which are to be
the Principles of Knowledge, regulating our Practice. Such natural Impressions
on the Understanding, are so far from being confirmed hereby, that this is an
Argument against them; since if there were certain Characters, imprinted by
Nature on the Understanding, as the Principles of Knowledge, we could not but
perceive them constantly operate in us, and influence our Knowledge, as we do
those others on the Will and Appetite; which never cease to be the constant
Spring and Motives of all our Actions, to which, we perpetually feel them
strongly impelling us.

{#4} Another Reason that makes me doubt of any innate practical Principles, is,
That I think, _there cannot any one moral Rule be propos'd, whereof a Man may
not justly demand a Reason_: which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd, if
they were innate, or so much as self-evident; which every innate Principle must
needs be, and not need any Proof to ascertain its Truth, nor want any Reason to
gain it Approbation. He would be thought void of common Sense, who asked on the
one side, or on the other side went about to give a Reason, _Why it is
impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be._ It carries its own Light
and Evidence with it, and needs no other Proof: He that understands the Terms,
assents to it for its own sake, or else nothing will ever be able to prevail
with him to do it. But should that most unshaken Rule of Morality, and
Foundation of all social Virtue, _That one should do as he would be done unto,_
be propos'd to one, who never heard it before, but yet is of capacity to
understand its meaning; Might he not without any absurdity ask a Reason, why?
And were not he that propos'd it, bound to make out the Truth and Reasonableness
of it to him? Which plainly shews it not to be innate; for if it were, it could
neither want nor receive any Proof: but must needs (at least, as soon as heard
and understood) be received and assented to, as an unquestionable Truth, which a
Man can by no means doubt of. So that the truth of all these moral Rules,
plainly depends upon some other antecedent to them, and from which they must be
deduced, which could not be, if either they were innate, or so much as
self-evident.

{#5} That Men should keep their Compacts, is certainly a great and undeniable
Rule in Morality: But yet, if a Christian, who has the view of Happiness and
Misery in another Life, be asked why a Man must keep his Word, he will _give_
this as _a Reason_: Because God, who has the Power of eternal Life and Death,
requires it of us. But if an _Hobbist_ be asked why; he will answer: Because the
Publick requires it, and the _Leviathan_ will punish you, if you do not. And if
one of the old _Heathen_ Philosophers had been asked, he would have answered:
Because it was dishonest, below the Dignity of a Man, and opposite to Vertue,
the highest Perfection of humane Nature.

{#6} Hence naturally flows the great variety of Opinions, concerning Moral
Rules, which are to be found amongst Men, according to the different sorts of
Happiness, they have a Prospect of, or propose to themselves: Which could not
be, if practical Principles were innate, and imprinted in our Minds immediately
by the Hand of God. I grant the existence of God, is so many ways manifest, and
the Obedience we owe him, so congruous to the Light of Reason, that a great part
of Mankind give Testimony to the Law of Nature: But yet I think it must be
allowed, That several Moral Rules, may receive, from Mankind, a very general
Approbation, without either knowing, or admitting the true ground of Morality;
which can only be the Law of a God, who sees Men in the dark, and has Power
enough to punish the proudest Offender. For God, having, by an inseparable
connection, joined _Vertue_ and publick Happiness together; and made the
Practice thereof, necessary to the preservation of Society, and visibly
_beneficial_ to all, with whom the vertuous Man has to do; it is no wonder, that
every one should, not only allow, but recommend, and magnifie those Rules to
others, from whose observance of them, he is sure to reap Advantage to himself.
He may, out of Interest, as well as Conviction, cry up that for Sacred; which if
once trampled on, and prophaned, he himself cannot be safe nor secure. This,
though it takes nothing from the Moral and Eternal Obligation, which these Rules
evidently have; yet it shews, that the outward acknowledgment Men pay to them in
their Words, proves not that they are innate Principles: Nay, it proves not so
much, as, that Men assent to them inwardly in their own Minds, as the inviolable
Rules of their own Practice: Since we find that self-Interest and the
Conveniences of this Life, make many Men own an outward Profession and
Approbation of them, whose Actions sufficiently prove, that they very little
consider the Law-giver, that prescribed these Rules; nor, the Hell he has
ordain'd for the Punishment of those that transgress them.

{#7} For, if we will not in Civility allow too much Sincerity to the Professions
of most _Men,_ but think their Actions to be the Interpreters of their Thoughts;
we shall find, that they have _no_ such internal Veneration for these Rules, nor
so _full a Perswasion of their Certainty_ and Obligation. The great Principle of
Morality, _To do as one would be done to,_ is more commended, than practised.
But the Breach of this Rule cannot be a greater Vice, than to teach others, That
it is no Moral Rule, nor Obligatory, would be thought Madness, and contrary to
that Interest Men sacrifice to, when they break it themselves. Perhaps
_Conscience_ will be urged as checking us for such Breaches, and so the internal
Obligation and Establishment of the Rule be preserved.

{#8} To which, I answer, That I doubt not, but without being written on their
Hearts, many Men, may, by the same way that they come to the Knowledge of other
things, come to assent to several Moral Rules, and be convinced of their
Obligation. Others also may come to be of the same Mind, from their Education,
Company, and Customs of their Country; which _Perswasion however got, will serve
to set Conscience on work,_ which is nothing else, but our own Opinion of our
own Actions. And if Conscience be a Proof of innate Principles, contraries may
be innate Principles: Since some Men, with the same bent of Conscience,
prosecute what others avoid.

{#9} But I cannot see how any _Men,_ should ever _transgress_ those _Moral
Rules, with Confidence, and Serenity,_ were they innate, and stamped upon their
Minds. View but an Army at the sacking of a Town, and see what Observations, or
Sense of Moral Principles, or what touch of Conscience, for all the Outrages
they do. _Robberies, Murders, Rapes,_ are the Sports of Men set at Liberty from
Punishment and Censure. Have there not been whole Nations, and those of the most
civilized People, amongst whom, the exposing their Children, and leaving them in
the Fields, to perish by Want, or wild Beasts, has been the Practice, as little
condemned or scrupled, as the begetting them? Do they not still, in some
Countries, put them into the same Graves with their Mothers, if they die in
Child-birth; Or dispatch them, if a pretended Astrologer declares them to have
unhappy Stars? And are there not Places, where at a certain Age, they kill, or
expose their Parents without any remorse at all? In a Part of _Asia,_ the Sick,
when their Case comes to be thought desperate, are carried out and laid on the
Earth, before they are dead, and left there, exposed to Wind and Weather, to
perish without Assistance or Pity.[n1] It is familiar amongst the _Mengrelians,_
a People professing Christianity, to bury their Children alive without
scruple.[n2] There are Places where they eat their own Children.[n3] The
_Caribes_ were wont to geld their Children, on purpose to fat and eat them.[n4]
And _Garcilasso de la Vega_ tells us of a People in _Peru,_ which were wont to
fat and eat their Children they got on their female Captives, which they kept as
Concubines for that Pupose.[n5] The Virtues, whereby the _Tououpinambas_
believed they merited Paradise, were, Revenge, and eating abundance of their
Enemies.[n6] They have not so much as a Name for God, _Lery pag._ 216. No
Acknowledgment of any God, no Religion, no Worship, _pag._ 231. The Saints, who
are canoniz'd amongst the _Turks,_ lead Lives, which one cannot with Modesty
relate. A remarkable Passage to this Purpose, out of the Voyage of _Baumgarten,_
which is a Book, not every Day to be met with, I shall set down at large, in the
Language it is published in. _Ibi_ (_sc. prope_ Belbes _in_ AEgypto) _vidimus
sanctum unum Saracenicum inter arenarum cumulos, ita ut ex utero matris prodiit
nudum sedentem. Mos est, ut didicimus_ Mahometistis, _ut eos, qui amentes & sine
ratione sunt, pro sanctis colant & venerentur. Insuper & eos qui cumdiu vitam
egerint inquinatissimam, voluntariam demum paenitentiam & paupertatem,
sanctitate venerandos deputant. Ejusmodi verò genus hominum libertatem quandam
effraenem habent, domos quas volunt intrandi, edendi, bibendi, & quod majus est,
concumbendi; ex quo concubitu, si proles secuta suerit, sancta similiter
habetur. His ergo hominibus, dum vivunt, magnos exhibent honores; mortuis verò
vel templa vel monumenta extruunt amplissima, eos{que} contingere ac sepelire
maximae fortunae ducunt loco. Audivimus haec dicta & dicenda per interpretem à
Mucrelo nostro. Insuper sanctum illum, quem eo loci vidimus, publicitus apprimè
commendari, eum esse Hominem sanctum, divinum ac integritate praecipuum; eo
quod, nec faeminarum unquam esset nec puerorum, sed tantummodo asellarum
concubitor atque mularum._ Peregr. Baumgarten, l. 2. c. 1. _p._ 73. Where then
are those innate Principles, of Justice, Piety, Gratitude, Equity, Chastity? Or,
where is that universal Consent, that assures us there are such inbred Rules?
Murders in Duels, when Fashion has made them honourable, are committed without
remorse of Conscience: Nay, in many Places, Innocence in this Case is the
greatest Ignominy. And if we will look abroad, to take a view of Men, as they
are, we shall find, that they have a remorse, in one Place, for doing or
omitting that, which others, in another Place, think they merit by.

{#10} He that will carefully peruse the History of Mankind, and look abroad into
the several Tribes of Men, and with indifferency survey their Actions, will be
able to satisfie himself, That there is scarce that Principle of Morality to be
named, or _Rule of Vertue_ to be thought on (those only excepted, that are
absolutely necessary to hold Society together, which commonly too are neglected
betwixt distinct Societies) which is not, somewhere or other, _slighted_ and
condemned by the general Fashion of _whole Societies_ of Men, governed by
practical Opinions, and Rules of living quite opposite to others.

{#11} Here, perhaps, 'twill be objected, that it is no Argument, that the _Rule_
is _not known, because_ it is _broken._ I grant the Objection good, where Men,
though they transgress, yet disown not the Law; where fear of Shame, Censure, or
Punishment, carries the Mark of some awe it has upon them. But it is impossible
to conceive, that a _whole Nation_ of Men should all _publickly reject_ and
renounce, what every one of them, certainly and infallibly, knew to be a Law:
For so they must, who have it naturally imprinted on their Minds. 'Tis possible,
Men may sometimes own _Rules of Morality,_ which, in their private Thoughts,
they do not believe to be true, only to keep themselves in Reputation, and
Esteem amongst those, who are perswaded of their Obligation. But 'tis not to be
imagin'd, That a whole Society of Men, should, publickly and professedly,
disown, and cast off a Rule, which they could not, in their own Minds, but be
infallibly certain, was a Law; nor be ignorant, That all Men, they should have
to do with, knew it to be such: And therefore must every one of them apprehend
from others, all the Contempt and Abhorrence due to one, who professes himself
void of Humanity; and one, who confounding the known and natural measures of
Right and Wrong, cannot but be look'd on, as the professed Enemy of their Peace
and Happiness. Whatever practical Principle is innate, cannot but be known to
every one, to be just and good. It is therefore little less than a
contradiction, to suppose, That whole Nations of Men should both in their
Professions, and Practice unanimously and universally give the Lye to, what, by
the most invincible Evidence, every one of them knew to be true, right, and
good. This is enough to satisfie us, That no practical Rule, which is any where
universally, and with publick Approbation, or Allowance, transgressed, can be
supposed innate. But I have something farther to add, in Answer to this
Objection.

{#12} The breaking of a Rule, say you, is no Argument, that it is unknown. I
grant it: But the _generally allowed breach of it any where,_ I say, _is a
Proof, that it is not innate._ For Example, Let us take any of these Rules;
which being the most obvious deductions of Humane Reason, and conformable to the
natural Inclination of the greatest part of Men, fewest People have had the
Impudence to deny, or Inconsideration to doubt of. If any can be thought to be
naturally imprinted, none, I think, can have a fairer Pretence to be innate,
than this; _Parents preserve and cherish your Children._ When therefore you say,
That this is an innate Rule, What do you mean? Either, that it is an innate
Principle; which upon all Occasions, excites and directs the Actions of all Men:
Or else, that it is a Truth, which all Men have imprinted on their Minds, and
which therefore they know, and assent to. But in neither of these Sences is it
innate. _First,_ That it is not a Principle, which influences all Men's Actions,
is, what I have proved by the Examples before cited: Nor need we seek so far as
_Mingrelia_ or _Peru,_ to find instances of such as neglect, abuse, nay and
destroy their Children; or look on it only as the more than Brutality of some
savage and barbarous Nations, when we remember, that it was a familiar, and
uncondemned Practice amongst the _Greeks_ and _Romans,_ to expose, without pity
or remorse, their innocent Infants. _Secondly,_ That it is an innate Truth,
known to all Men, is also false. For, _Parents preserve your Children,_ is so
far from an innate Truth, that it is no Truth at all; it being a Command, and
not a Proposition, and so not capable of Truth or Falshood. To make it capable
of being assented to as true, it must be reduced to some such Proposition as
this: _It is the Duty of Parents to preserve their Children._ But what Duty is,
cannot be understood without a Law; nor a Law be known, or supposed without a
Law-maker, or without Reward and Punishment: So that it is impossible, that
this, or any other practical Principle should be innate; _i. e._ be imprinted on
the Mind as a Duty, without supposing the _Idea's_ of God, of Law, of
Obligation, of Punishment, of a Life after this, innate. For that Punishment
follows not, in this Life, the breach of this Rule; and consequently, that it
has not the Force of a Law in Countries, where the generally allow'd Practice
runs counter to it, is in it self evident. But these _Idea's_ (which must be all
of them innate, if any thing as a Duty be so) are so far from being innate, that
'tis not every studious or thinking Man, much less every one that is born, in
whom they are to be found clear and distinct: And that one of them, which of all
others seems most likely to be innate, is not so, (I mean the _Idea_ of God) I
think, in the next Chapter, will appear very evident to any considering Man.

{#13} From what has been said, I think we may safely conclude, That, _whatever
practical Rule is, in any Place, generally, and with allowance, broken, cannot
be supposed innate,_ it being impossible, that Men should, without Shame or
Fear, confidently and serenely break a Rule, which they could not but evidently
know, that God had set up, and would certainly punish the breach of (which they
must if it were innate) to a degree to make it a very ill Bargain to the
Transgressor. Without such a Knowledge as this, a Man can never be certain, that
any thing is his Duty. Ignorance or Doubt of the Law; hopes to escape the
Knowledge or Power of the Law-maker, or the like, may make Men give way to a
present Appetite: But let any one see the Fault, and the Rod by it, and with the
Transgression, a Fire ready to punish it; a Pleasure tempting, and the Hand of
the Almighty visibly held up, and prepared to take Vengeance (for this must be
the Case, where any Duty is imprinted on the Mind) and then tell me, whether it
be possible, for People, with such a Prospect, such a certain Knowledge as this,
wantonly, and without scruple, to offend against a Law, which they carry about
them in indelible Characters, and that stares them in the Face, whilst they are
breaking it? Whether Men, at the same time that they feel in themselves the
imprinted Edicts of an Omnipotent Law-maker, can, with assurance and gaity,
slight and trample under Foot his most sacred Injunctions? And lastly, Whether
it be possible, that whilst a Man thus openly bids defiance to this innate Law,
and supreme Law-giver, all the by-standers; yea even the Governors and Rulers of
the People, full of the same Sense, both of the Law and Law-maker, should
silently connive, without testifying their dislike, or laying the least blame on
it? Principles of Actions indeed there are lodged in Mens Appetites, but these
are so far from being innate Moral Principles, that if they were left to their
full swing, they would carry Men to the overturning of all Morality. Moral Laws
are set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant Desires, which they cannot
be but by Rewards and Punishments, that will over-balance the satisfaction any
one shall propose to himself in the breach of the Law. If therefore any thing be
imprinted on the Mind of all Men as a Law, all Men must have a certain and
unavoidable knowledge, that certain, and unavoidable punishment will attend the
breach of it. For if Men can be ignorant or doubtful of what is innate, innate
Principles are insisted on, and urged to no purpose; Truth and Certainty (the
things pretended) are not at all secured by them: But Men are in the same
uncertain, floating estate with, as without them. An evident indubitable
knowledge of unavoidable punishment, great enough to make the transgression very
uneligible, must accompany an innate Law: Unless with an innate Law, they can
suppose an innate Gospel too. I would not be here mistaken, as if, because I
deny an innate Law, I thought there were none but positive Laws. There is a
great deal of difference between an innate Law, and a Law of Nature; between
something imprinted on our Minds in their very original, and something that we
may attain to the knowledge of, by our natural Faculties from natural
Principles. And I think they equally forsake the Truth, who running into the
contrary extreams, either affirm an innate Law, or deny that there is a Law,
knowable by the light of Nature; _i. e._ without the help of positive
Revelation.

{#14} The difference there is amongst Men in their practical Principles, is so
evident, that, I think, I need say no more to evince, that it will be
imposisible to find any innate Moral Rules, by this mark of general assent: And
'tis enough to make one suspect, that the supposition of such innate Principles,
is but an Opinion taken up at pleasure; since those who talk so confidently of
them, are so sparing to _tell_ us, _which they are._ This might with Justice be
expected from those Men, who lay stress upon this Opinion: and it gives occasion
to distrust either their Knowledge or Charity, who declaring, That God has
imprinted on the Minds of Men, the foundations of Knowledge, and the Rules of
Living, are yet so little favourable to the Information of their Neighbours, or
the Quiet of Mankind, as not to point out to them, which they are, in the
variety Men are distracted with. But in truth, were there any such innate
Principles, there would be no need to teach them. Did Men find such innate
Propositions stamped on their Minds, they would easily be able to distinguish
them from other Truths, that they afterwards learned, and deduced from them; and
there would be nothing more easie, than to know what, and how many they were.
There could be no more doubt about their number, than there is about the number
of our Fingers; and 'tis like then, every System would be ready to give them us
by tale. But since no body, that I know, has ventured yet to give a Catalogue of
them, they cannot blame those who doubt of these innate Principles; since even
they who require Men to believe, that there are such innate Propositions, do not
tell us what they are. 'Tis easie to foresee, that if different Men of different
Sects should go about to give us a List of those innate practical Principles,
they would set down only such as suited their distinct Hypotheses, and were fit
to support the Doctrines of their particular Schools or Churches: A plain
evidence, that there are no such innate Truths. Nay, a great part of Men are so
far from finding any such innate Moral Principles in themselves, that by denying
freedom to Mankind; and thereby making Men no other than bare Machins, they take
away not only innate, but all Moral Rules whatsoever, and leave not a
possibility to believe any such, to those who cannot conceive, how any thing can
be capable of a Law, that is not a free Agent: And upon that ground, they must
necessarily reject all Principles of Vertue, who cannot _put Morality and
Mechanism together_; which are not very easie to be reconciled, or made
consistent.

{#15} When I had writ this, being informed, that my Lord _Herbert_ had in his
Books _de Veritate,_ assigned these innate Principles, I presently consulted
him, hoping to find, in a Man of so great Parts, something that might satisfie
me in this point, and put an end to my Enquiry. In his Chapter _de Instinctu
naturali, p._ 76. _edit._ 1656. I met with these six Marks of his _notitiae
Communes,_ 1. _Prioritas._ 2. _Independentia._ 3. _Vniversalitas._ 4.
_Certitudo._ 5. _Necessitas,_ i. e. as he explains it, _faciunt ad hominis
conservationem._ 6. _Modus conformationis,_ i. e. _Assensus nullâ interpositâ
morâ._ And at the latter end of his little Treatise, _De Religione Laici,_ he
say this of these innate Principles: _Adeo ut non uniuscujusvis Religionis
confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritates. Sunt enim in ipsâ mente
coelitùs descriptae nullisque traditionibus, sive scriptis, sive non scriptis,
obnoxiae,_ p. 3. And _veritates nostrae Catholicae, quae tanquam indubia Dei
effata in foro interiori descripta._ Thus having given the marks of the innate
Principles or common Notions, and asserted their being imprinted on the Minds of
Men by the Hand of God, he proceeds at last to set them down; and they are
these: 1. _Esse aliquod supremum numen._ 2. _Numen illud coli debere._ 3.
_Virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimam esse rationem cultùs divini._ 4.
_Rescipiscendum esse à peccatis._ 5. _Dari proemium vel poenam post hanc vitam
transactam._ These, though I allow them to be clear Truths, and such as, if
rightly explained, a rational Creature can hardly avoid giving his assent to:
yet I think he is far from proving them innate Impressions _in Foro interiori
descriptae._ For I must take leave to observe,

{#16} First, That these Five Propositions are either all, or more than all,
those common Notions writ on our Minds by the finger of God, if it were
reasonable to believe any at all to be so written. Since there are other
Propositions, which even by his own Rules, have as just a pretence to such an
Original, and may be as well admitted for innate Principles, as, at least, some
of these Five he enumerates, _viz. Do as thou wouldst be done unto_: And,
perhaps, some hundreds of others, when well considered.

{#17} Secondly, That all his Marks are not to be found in each of his Five
Propositions, _viz._ his First, Second, and Third Marks, agree perfectly to
neither of them; and the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Marks, agree
but ill to his Third, Fourth, and Fifth Propositions. For besides that, we are
assured from History, of many Men, nay, whole Nations who doubt or disbelieve
some or all of them, I cannot see how the Third, _viz. That Vertue joined with
Piety, is the best Worship of God,_ can be an innate Principle, when the name,
or sound _Vertue,_ is so hard to be understood; liable to so much uncertainty in
its signification; and the thing it stands for, so much contended about, and
difficult to be known. And therefore this can be but a very uncertain Rule of
Humane Practice, and serve but very little to the conduct of our Lives, and is
therefore very unfit to be assigned as an innate practical principle.

{#18} For let us consider this Proposition as to its meaning, (for it is the
sence, and not sound, that is and must be the Principle or common Notion) _viz.
Vertue is the best Worship of God_; i. e. is most acceptable to him; which if
_Vertue_ be taken, as most commonly it is, for those Actions, which according to
the different Opinions of several Countries, are accounted laudable, will be a
Proposition so far from being certain, that it will not be true. If _Vertue_ be
taken for Actions conformable to God's Will, or to the Rule prescribed by God,
which is the true and only measure of Vertue; then this Proposition, _That
Vertue is the best Worship of God,_ will be most true and certain, but of very
little use in humane Life: since it will amount to no more but this, _viz. That
God is pleased with the doing of what he Commands_; which a Man may certainly
know to be true, without knowing what it is that God doth command; and so be as
far from any Rule or Principle of his Actions, as he was before: And I think
very few will take a Proposition which amounts to no more than this, _viz._ That
God is pleased with the doing of what he himself commands, for an innate Moral
principle writ on the Minds of all Men, (however true and certain it may be)
since it teaches so little. Whosoever does so, will have reason to think
hundreds of Propositions, innate Principles, since there are many who have as
good a title as this to be received for such, which no body yet ever put into
that rank of innate Principles.

{#19} Nor is the Fourth Proposition _(viz.) Men must repent of their Sins,_ much
more instructive, till what those Actions are, that are meant by Sins, be set
down. For the word _Peccata,_ or _Sins,_ being put, as it usually is, to
signifie in general ill Actions, that will draw on punishment upon the Doers;
What great Principle of Morality can that be, to tell us we should be sorry, and
cease to do that which will bring mischief upon us, without knowing what those
particular Actions are, that will do so? Indeed, this is a very true
Proposition, and fit to be inculcated on, and received by those, who are
supposed, to have been taught, what Actions in all kinds are _sin_; but neither
this, nor the former, can be imagined to be innate Principles; nor to be of any
use, if they were innate, unless the particular measures and bounds of all
Vertues and Vices, were engraven in Mens Minds, and were innate Principles also,
which I think is very much to be doubted. And therefore, I imagine, it will
scarce seem possible, that God should engrave Principles in Mens minds, in words
of uncertain signification, such as are _Vertues_ and _Sins_; which amongst
different Men, stand for different things: Nay, it cannot be supposed to be in
words at all, (which being in most of these Principles very general names)
cannot be understood, but by knowing the particulars comprehended under them.
And in the practical instances, the measures must be taken from the knowledge of
the Actions themselves, and the Rules of them abstracted from words, and
antecedent to the knowledge of Names; which Rules a Man must know, what Language
soever he chance to learn, whether English or Japan, or if he should learn no
Language at all, or never should understand the use of Words, as happens in the
case of Dumb and Deaf Men. When it shall be made out, that Men ignorant of
Words, or untaught by the Laws and Customs of their Country, that it is part of
the Worship of God, Not to kill another Man; Not to know more Women than one;
Not to procure Abortion; Not to expose their Children; Not to take from another
what is his, though we want it our selves, but on the contrary, relieve and
supply his wants: And whenever we have done the contrary, we ought to repent, be
sorry, and resolve to do so no more. When, I say, all men shall be proved
actually to know, and allow all these and a thousand other such Rules, all which
come under these two general words made use of above, _viz. Virtutes & Peccata,
Vertues_ and _Sins,_ there will be more reason for admitting these, and the
like, for common Notions, and practical Principles: yet after all, universal
Consent (were there any in Moral Principles) to Truths, the knowledge whereof
might be attained otherwise, would scarce prove them to be innate; which is all
I contend for.

{#20} Nor will it be of much moment here, to offer that very ready, but not very
material Answer, (_viz._) That the _innate Principles_ of Morality, _may, by
Education, and Custom,_ and the general Opinion of those amongst whom we
converse, _be darkened,_ and at last _quite worn out_ of the Minds of Men. Which
assertion of theirs, if true quite takes away the Argument of universal Consent,
by which this Opinion of innate Principles is endeavoured to be proved: unless
those men will think it reasonable, that their own private Perswasions, or that
of their Party, should pass for universal Consent; a thing not unfrequently
done, when men presuming themselves to be the only Masters of right Reason, cast
by the Votes and Opinions of the rest of Mankind, as not worthy the reckoning.
And then their Argument stands thus: The Principles which all mankind allow for
true, are innate; those that men of right Reason admit, are the Principles
allowed by all mankind; we and those of our mind, are men of right Reason;
therefore we agreeing, our Principles are innate; which is a very pretty way of
arguing, and a short cut to Infallibility. For otherwise it will be very hard to
understand, how there be some Principles which all men do acknowledge, and agree
in; and yet there are none of those _Principles_ which are _not by depraved
Custom and ill Education blotted out_ of the minds of many men: Which is to say,
That all men admit, but yet many men do deny, and dissent from them. And indeed
the supposition of such first Principles, will serve us to very little purpose;
and we shall be as much at a loss with, as without them, if they may by any
humane Power, such as is the Will of our Teachers, or Opinions of our
Companions, be altered or lost in us; and notwithstanding all this boast of
first Principles, and innate Light, we shall be as much in the dark and
uncertainty, as if there were no such thing at all. It being all one to have no
Rule, and one that will warp any way; or amongst various and contrary Rules, not
to know which is the right. But concerning innate Principles, I desire these men
to say, whether they can, or cannot, by Education and Custom, be blurr'd and
blotted out: If they cannot, we must find them in all Mankind alike, and they
must be clear in every body: And if they may suffer variation from adventitious
Notions, we must then find them clearest and most perspicuous, nearest the
Fountain in Children and illiterate People, who have received least impression
from foreign Opinions. Let them take which side they please, they will certainly
find it inconsistent with visible matter of fact, and daily observation.

{#21} I easily grant, that there are great numbers of _Opinions,_ which, by men
of different Countries, Educations, and Tempers, are received and _embraced as
first and unquestionable Principles; many whereof,_ both for their absurdity, as
well as oppositions one to another, _it is impossible should be true._ But yet
all those Propositions, how remote soever from Reason, are so sacred somewhere
or other, that Men, even of good Understanding in other matters, will sooner
part with their Lives, and whatever is dearest to them, than suffer themselves
to doubt, or others to question, the truth of them.

{#22} This, however strange it may seem, is that which every days Experience
confirms; and will not, perhaps, appear so wonderful, if we consider the _ways,_
and steps _by which_ it is brought about; and how really it may come to pass,
that _Doctrines,_ that have been derived from no better original, than the
Superstition of a Nurse, or the Authority of an old Woman, may, by length of
time, and consent of Neighbours, _grow up to the dignity of Principles_ in
Religion or Morality. For such, who are careful (as they call it) to principle
Children well, (and few there be who have not a set of those Principles for
them, which they believe in) instill into the unwary, and, as yet, unprejudiced
Understanding, (for white Paper receives any Characters) those Doctrines they
would have them retain and profess. These being taught them as soon as they have
any apprehension; and still as they grow up, confirmed to them, either by the
open Profession, or tacit Consent, of all they have to do with; or at least by
those, of whose Wisdom, Knowledge, and Piety, they have an Opinion, who never
suffer those Propositions to be otherwise mentioned, but as the Basis and
Foundation, on which they build either their Religion or Manners, come by these
means to have the Reputation of unquestionable, self-evident, and innate Truths.

{#23} To which we may add, That when _Men,_ so instructed, are grown up, and
reflect on their own Minds, they cannot find any thing more ancient there, than
those Opinions which were taught them, before their Memory began to keep a
Register of their Actions, or date the time when any new thing appeared to them;
and therefore make no scruple to _conclude, That those Propositions, of whose
knowledge they can find in themselves no original, were certainly the impress of
God and Nature_ upon their Minds; and not taught them by any one else. These
they entertain and submit to, as many do to their Parents, with Veneration; not
because it is natural; nor do Children do it, where they are not so taught, but
because, having been always so educated, and having no remembrance of the
beginning of this Respect, they think it is natural.

{#24} This will appear very likely, and almost unavoidable to come to pass, if
we consider the Nature of Mankind, and the Constitution of Humane Affairs:
Wherein _most Men cannot live, without employing their time in the daily Labours
of their Callings; nor be at quiet in their Minds, without some Foundation or
Principles to rest their Thoughts on._ There is scarce any one so floating and
superficial in his Understanding, that hath not some reverenced Propositions,
which are to him the Principles on which he bottoms his Reasonings; and by which
he judgeth of Truth and Falshood, Right and Wrong; which some, wanting skill and
leisure, and others the inclination, and some being taught, They ought not to
examine; there are few to be found, who are not exposed by their Ignorance,
Laziness, Education, or Precipitancy, to _take them upon trust._

{#25} This is evidently the case of all Children and young Folk; and Custom, a
greater power than Nature, seldom failing to make them worship for Divine, what
she hath inured them to bow their Minds, and submit their Understandings to; it
is no wonder, that grown _Men,_ either perplexed in the necessary affairs of
Life, or hot in the pursuit of Pleasures, should _not_ seriously sit down to
_examine their own Tenets_; especially when one of their Principles is, That
Principles ought not to be questioned. And had Men leisure, parts, and will, Who
is there almost that dares to shake the foundations of all his past Thoughts and
Actions, and endure to bring upon himself, the shame of having been a long time
wholly in mistake and error? Who is there hardy enough to contend with the
reproach, which is every where prepared for those, who dare venture to dissent
from the received Opinions of their Country or Party? And where is the man to be
found, that can patiently prepare himself to bear the name of Whimsical,
Sceptical, or Atheist, which he is sure to meet with, who does in the least
scruple any of the common Opinions? And he will be much more _afraid to question
those Principles,_ when he shall think them, as most men do, the Standards set
up by God in his Mind, to be the Rule and Touchstone of all other Opinions. And
what can hinder him from thinking them sacred, when he finds them the earliest
of all his own Thoughts, and the most reverenced by others?

{#26} It is easie to imagine, _how_ by these means it comes to pass, that Men
worship the Idols have been set up in their Minds; grow fond of the Notions they
have been long acquainted with there; and _stamp the Characters of Divinity,
upon Absurdities and Errors,_ become zealous Votaries to Bulls and Munkies; and
contented too, fight, and die in defence of their Opinions. _Dum solos credit
habendos esse Deos, quos ipse colit._ For since the reasoning Faculties of the
Soul, which are almost constantly, though not always warily nor wisely employ'd,
would not know how to move for want of a foundation, and footing, in most Men,
who through laziness or avocation, do not; or for want of time, or true helps,
or other causes, cannot penetrate into the Principles of Knowledge, and trace
Truth, to its fountain and original, 'tis natural for them, and almost
unavoidable, to take up with some borrowed Principles; which being reputed and
presumed to be the evident proofs of other things, are thought not to need any
other proof themselves. Whoever shall receive any of these into their thoughts,
without due examination, but believe them, because they are to be believed, may
take up from his Education, and the fashions of his Country, any absurdity for
innate Principles; and by long poring on the same Objects, so dim his sight, as
to take Monsters lodged in his own brain, for the Images of the Deity, and the
Workmanship of his Hands.

{#27} By this progress, how many there are, who arrive at Principles, which they
believe innate, may be easily observed, in the variety of opposite Principles,
held, and contended for, by all sorts and degrees of Men. And he that shall deny
this to be the method, wherein most Men proceed, to the assurance they have of
the unalterable truth and evidence of their Principles, will, perhaps, find it a
hard matter, any other way to account for the contrary Tenets, which are firmly
believed, confidently asserted, and which great numbers are ready at any time to
seal with their Blood. And, indeed, if it be the privilege of innate Principles,
to be received upon their own Authority, without examination, I know not what
may not be believed, or how any ones _Principles_ can be questioned. If they
may, and _ought to be examined,_ and tried, I desire to know how first and
innate Principles can be tried; or at least it is reasonable to demand the marks
and characters, whereby the genuine, innate Principles, may be distinguished
from others; that so, amidst the great variety of Pretenders, I may be kept from
mistakes, in so material a point as this. When this is done, I shall be ready to
embrace such welcome, and useful, Propositions; and till then I may with modesty
doubt, since I fear universal Consent, which is the only one produced, will
scare prove a sufficient mark to direct my Choice, and assure me of any innate
Principles. From what has been said, I think it is past doubt, that there are no
practical Principles wherein all Men agree; and therefore none innate.
