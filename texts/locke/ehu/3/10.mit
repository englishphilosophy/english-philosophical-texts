£2 _Of the Abuse of Words._ £2

{#1} BEsides the imperfection that is naturally in Language, and the obscurity
and confusion that is so hard to be avoided in the Use of Words, there are
several _wilful Faults and Neglects,_ which Men are guilty of, in this way of
Communication, whereby they render these signs less clear and distinct in their
signification, than naturally they need to be.

{#2} _First,_ In this kind, the first and most palpable abuse is, the using of
Words, without clear and distinct _Ideas_; or, which is worse, signs without any
thing signified. Of these there are two sorts: I. One may observe, in all
Languages, certain Words, that if they be examined, will be found, in their
first Original, and their appropriated Use, not to stand for any clear and
distinct _Ideas._ These, for the most part, the several _Sects_ of Philosophy
and Religion have introduced. For their Authors, or Promoters, either affecting
something singular, and out of the way of common apprehensions, or to support
some strange Opinions, or cover some Weakness of their Hypothesis, seldom fail
to _coin_ new Words, and such as, when they come to be examined, may justly be
called _insignificant Terms._ For having either had no determinable Collection
of _Ideas_ annexed to them, when they were first invented; or at least such as,
if well examined, will be found inconsistent, 'tis no wonder if afterwards, in
the vulgar use of the same party, they remain empty Sounds, with little or no
signification, amongst those who think it enough to have them often in their
mouths, as the distinguishing Characters of their Church, or School, without
much troubling their heads to examine, what are the precise _Ideas_ they stand
for. I shall not need here to heap up instances, every one's reading and
conversation will sufficiently furnish him: Or if he wants to be better stored,
the great Mint-Masters of these kind of Terms, I mean the Schoolmen and
Metaphysicians, (under which, I think, the disputing natural and moral
Philosophers of these latter Ages, may be comprehended,) have wherewithal
abundantly to content him.

{#3} II. Others there be, who extend this abuse yet farther, who take so little
care to lay by Words, which in their primary notation have scarce any clear and
distinct _Ideas_ they are annexed to, that by an unpardonable negligence, they
familiarly _use Words,_ which the Propriety of Language has affixed to very
important _Ideas,_ they use them, I say, _without any distinct meaning_ at all.
_Wisdom, Glory, Grace,_ &c. are Words frequent enough in every Man's mouth; but
if a great many of those who use them, should be asked, What they mean by them?
they would be at a stand, and not know what to answer: A plain proof, that
though they have learned those Sounds, and have them ready at their Tongues
ends, yet there are no clear and distinct _Ideas_ laid up in their Minds, which
are to be expressed to others by them.

{#4} _Men,_ having been _accustomed_ from their Cradles _to learn Words,_ which
are easily got and retained, _before they knew,_ or had framed _the complex
Ideas,_ to which they were annexed, or which were to be found in the things
_they_ were thought to _stand_ for, they _usually continue to do so_ all their
Lives, and without taking the pains necessary to settle in their Minds clear and
distinct _Ideas,_ they use their Words for such unsteady and confused Notions as
they have, contenting themselves with the same Words other People use; as if
their very sound, necessarily carried with it constantly the same meaning. This
though Men make a shift with, in their ordinary Occurrences of Life, where they
find it necessary to be understood, and therefore they make signs till they are
so: Yet this insignificancy in their Words, when they come to Reason, concerning
either their Tenents or Interest, manifestly fills their Discourse with
abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon, especially in moral Matters,
where the Words, for the most part, standing for arbitrary and numerous
Collections of _Ideas,_ not regularly and permanently united in Nature, their
bare Sounds are often only thought on, or at least very obscure and uncertain
Notions annexed to them. Men take the Words they find in use amongst their
Neighbours; and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for, use them
confidently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning:
Whereby, besides the ease of it, they obtain this advantage, That as in such
Discourses they seldom are in the right, so they are as seldom to be convinced,
that they are in the wrong; it being all one to go about to draw those Men out
of their Mistakes, who have no setled Notions, as to dispossess a Vagrant of his
Habitation, who has no setled abode: This I guess to be so; and every one may
observe in himself and others, whether it be, or no.

{#5} _Secondly,_ Another great abuse of Words is, _Inconstancy_ in the use of
them. It is hard to find a Discourse written of any Subject, especially of
Controversie, wherein one shall not observe, if he read with attention, the same
Words (and those commonly the most material in the Discourse, and upon which the
Argument turns) used sometimes for one Collection of simple _Ideas,_ and
sometimes for another, which is a perfect abuse of Language. Words being
intended for signs of my _Ideas,_ to make them known to others, not by any
natural signification, but by a voluntary imposition, 'tis plain cheat and
abuse, when I make them stand sometimes for one thing, and sometimes for
another; the wilful doing whereof, can be imputed to nothing but great folly, or
greater dishonesty. And a Man, in his Accompts with another, may, with as much
fairness, make the Characters of Numbers stand sometimes for one, and sometimes
for another Collection of Unites: _v. g._ this Character 3, stands sometimes for
three, sometimes for four, and sometimes for eight; as in his Discourse, or
Reasoning, make the same Words stand for different Collections of simple
_Ideas._ If Men should do so in their Reckonings, I wonder who would have to do
with them? One who should speak thus, in the Affairs and Business in the World,
and call 8 sometimes seven, sometimes nine, as best served his advantage, would
presently have clapp'd upon him one of the two Names Men constantly are
disgusted with; and yet in Arguings, and learned Contests, the same sort of
proceeding passes commonly for Wit and Learning: But yet, to me, it appears a
greater dishonesty, than the misplacing of Counters, in the casting up a Debt,
and the cheat the greater, by how much Truth is of greater concernment and
value, than Money.

{#6} _Thirdly,_ Another abuse of Language is, an _affected Obscurity,_ by either
applying old Words, to new and unusual Significations; or introducing new and
ambiguous Terms, without defining either; or else putting them so together, as
may confound their ordinary meaning. Though the Peripatetick Philosophy has been
most eminent in this way, yet other Sects have not been wholly clear of it.
There is scarce any of them, that are not cumbred with some Difficulties, (such
is the imperfection of Humane Knowledge,) which they have been fain to cover
with Obscurity of Terms, and to confound the Signification of Words, which, like
a mist before Peoples Eyes, might hinder their weak parts from being discovered.
That Body and Extension, in common use, stand for two distinct _Ideas,_ is plain
to any one that will but reflect a little: For were their Signification
precisely the same, it would be as proper, and as intelligible to say, the Body
of an Extension, as the Extension of a Body; and yet there are those who find it
necessary to confound their Signification. To this abuse, and the mischiefs of
confounding the Signification of Words, Logick, and the liberal Sciences, as
they have been handled in the Schools, have given Reputation; and the admired
Art of Disputing, hath added much to the natural imperfection of Languages,
whilst it has been made use of, and fitted to perplex the signification of
Words, more than to discover the Knowledge and Truth of Things: And he that will
look into that sort of learned Writings, will find the Words there much more
obscure, uncertain, and undetermined in their Meaning, than they are in ordinary
Conversation.

{#7} This is unavoidably to be so, where Mens Parts and Learning, are estimated
by their Skill in _Disputing._ And if Reputation and Reward shall attend these
Conquests, which depend mostly on the fineness and niceties of Words, 'tis no
wonder if the Wit of Man so employ'd, should perplex, involve, and subtilize the
signification of Sounds, so as never to want something to say, in opposing or
defending any Question; the Victory being adjusted not to him who had Truth on
his side, but the last word in the Dispute.

{#8} This, though a very useless Skill, and that which I think the direct
opposite to the ways of Knowledge, hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable
and esteemed Names of _Subtility_ and Acuteness, and has had the applause of the
Schools, and encouragement of one part of the learned Men of the World; and no
wonder, since the Philosophers of old, (the disputing and wrangling Philosophers
I mean, such as _Lucian_ wittily, and with Reason taxes,) and the Schoolmen
since, aiming at Glory and Esteem, for their great and universal Knowledge,
easier a great deal to be pretended to, than really acquired, found this a good
Expedient to cover their Ignorance, with a curious and unexplicable Web of
perplexed Words, and procure to themselves the admiration of others, by
unintelligible terms; the apter to produce wonder, because they could not be
understood: whilst it appears in all History, that these profound Doctors, were
no wiser, nor more useful, than their Neighbours; and brought but small
advantage to humane Life, or the Societies, wherein they lived: Unless the
coining of new Words, where they produced no new Things to apply them to, or the
perplexing or obscuring the signification of old ones, and so bringing all
Things into question and dispute, were a thing profitable to the Life of Man, or
worthy Commendation and Reward.

{#9} For, notwithstanding these learned Disputants, these all knowing Doctors,
it was to the unscholastick Statesman, that the Governments of the World owed
their Peace, Defence, and Liberties; and from the illiterate and contemned
Mechanick, (a Name of Disgrace,) that they received the improvemnts of useful
Arts. Nevertheless, this artificial Ignorance, and _learned Gibberish,_
prevailed mightily in these last Ages, by the Interest and Artifice of those,
who found no easier way to that pitch of Authority and Dominion they have
attained, than by amusing the Men of Business, and Ignorant, with hard Words, or
employing the Ingenious and Idle in intricate Disputes, about unintelligible
Terms, and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless Labyrinth.
Besides, there is no such way to gain admittance, or give defence to strange and
absurd Doctrines, as to guard them round about with Legions of obscure,
doubtful, and undefined Words. Which yet make these Retreats, more like the Dens
of Robbers, or Holes of Foxes, than the Fortresses of fair Warriours: which if
it be hard to get them out of, it is not for the strength that is in them, but
the Briars and Thorns, and the Obscurity of the Thickets they are beset with.
For Untruth being unacceptable to the Mind of Man, there is no other defence
left for Absurdity, but Obscurity.

{#10} Thus learned Ignorance, and this Art of keeping, even inquisitive Men,
from true Knowledge, hath been propagated in the World, and hath much perplexed,
whilst it pretended to inform the Understanding. For we see, that other
well-meaning and wise Men, whose Education and Parts had not attained that
accuteness, could intelligibly express themselves to one another; and in its
plain use, make a benefit of Language. But though unlearned Men well enough
understood the Words _White_ and _Black, &c._ and had constant Notions of the
_Ideas_ signified by those Words; yet there were Philosophers found, who had
learning and subtilty enough to prove, that _Snow_ was _black_; (_i. e._ to
prove, that White was Black;) whereby they had the advantage to destroy the
Instruments and Means of Discourse, Conversation, Instruction, and Society;
whilst with great Art and Subtility, they did no more but perplex and confound
the Signification of Words, and thereby render Language less useful, than the
real Defects of it had made it, a Gift, which the illiterate had not attained
to.

{#11} These learned Men did equally instruct Mens Understandings, and profit
their Lives, as he who should alter the signification of known Characters, and,
by a subtile Device of Learning, far surpassing the Capacity of the Illiterate,
Dull, and Vulgar, should, in his Writing, shew, that he could put _A._ for _B._
and _D._ for _E. &c._ to the no small admiration and benefit of his Reader; it
being as sensless to put _Black,_ which is a Word agreed on to stand for one
sensible _Idea,_ to put it, I say, for another, or the contrary _Idea, i. e._ to
call _Snow Black,_ as to put this mark _A._ which is a Character agreed on to
stand for one modification of Sound, made by a certain motion of the Organs of
Speech, for _B._ which is agreed on to stand for another modification of Sound,
made by another certain motion of the Organs of Speech.

{#12} Nor hath this mischief stopped in logical Niceties, or curious empty
Speculations; it hath invaded the great Concernments of Humane Life and Society;
obscured and perplexed the material Truths of Law and Divinity; brought
Confusion, Disorder, and Uncertainty into the Affairs of Mankind; and if not
destroyed, yet in great measure rendred useless, those two great Rules, Religion
and Justice. What have the greatest part of the Comments and Disputes, upon the
Laws of GOD and Man served for, but to make the meaning more doubtful, and
perplex the sense? What have been the effect of those multiplied curious
Distinctions, and accute Niceties, but Obscurity and Uncertainty, leaving the
Words more unintelligible, and the Reader more at a loss? How else comes it to
pass, that Princes, speaking or writing to their Servants, in their ordinary
Commands, are easily understood; speaking to their People, in their Laws, are
not so? And, as I remarked before, doth it not often happen, that a Man of an
ordinary Capacity, very well understands a Text, or a Law, that he reads, till
he consults an Expositor, or goes to Council; who by that time he hath done
explaining them, makes the Words signifie either nothing at all, or what he
pleases.

{#13} Whether any by Interests of these Professions have occasioned this, I will
not here examine; but I leave it to be considered, whether it would not be well
for Mankind, whose concernment it is to know Things as they are, and to do what
they ought; and not to spend their Lives in talking about them, or tossing Words
to and fro: Whether it would not be well, I say, that the Use of Words were made
plain, and direct; and that Language, which was given us for the improvement of
Knowledge, and bond of Society, should not be employ'd to darken Truth, and
unsettle Peoples Rights; to raise Mists, and render unintelligible both Morality
and Religion? Or that at least, if this will happen, it should not be thought
Learning or Knowledge to do so?

{#14} _Fourthly,_ Another great _abuse of Words is, the taking them for Things._
This, though it, in some degree, concerns all Names in general; yet more
particularly affects those of Substances: And to this Abuse, these Men are most
subject, who confine their Thoughts to any one System, and give themselves up
into a firm belief of the Perfection of any received Hypothesis; whereby they
come to be persuaded, that the Terms of that Sect, are so suited to the Nature
of Things, that they perfectly correspond with their real Existence. Who is
there, that has been bred up in the Peripatetick Philosophy, who does not think
the Ten Names, under which are ranked the Ten Predicaments, to be exactly
conformable to the Nature of Things? Who is there, of that School, that is not
persuaded, that _substantial forms, vegetative Souls, abhorrence of a Vacuum,
intentional Species,_ &c. are something real? These Words Men have learned from
their very entrance upon Knowledge, and have found their Masters and Systems lay
great stress upon them; and therefore they cannot quit the Opinion, that they
are conformable to Nature, and are the Representations of something that really
exists. The _Platonists_ have their _Soul of the World,_ and the _Epicureans_
their _endeavour towards Motion,_ in their Atoms, when at rest. There is scarce
any Sect in Philosophy has not a distinct set of Terms, that others understand
not. But yet this Gibberish, which in the weakness of Humane Understanding,
serves so well to palliate Mens Ignorance, and cover their Errours, comes by
familiar use amongst those of the same Tribe, to seem the most important part of
Language, and of all others the Terms the most significant: And should _Aërial_
and _AEtherial Vehicles_ come once, by the prevalency of that Doctrine, to be
generally received any where, no doubt those Terms would make impressions on
Mens Minds, so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such
Things, as much as that peripatetick Forms have heretofore done.

{#15} How much _names taken for Things,_ are apt to _mislead the Understanding,_
the attentive Reading of philosophical Writers would abundantly discover; and
that, perhaps, in Words little suspected of any such misuse. I shall instance in
one only, and that a very familiar one. How many intricate Disputes have there
been about _Matter,_ as if there were some such thing really in Nature, distinct
from _Body,_ as 'tis evident, the Word _Matter_ stands for an _Idea_ distinct
from the _Idea_ of Body. For if the _Ideas_ these two Terms stood for, were
precisely the same, they might indifferently in all Places be put one for the
other: but we see, that tho' it be proper to say, There is _one Matter of all
Bodies,_ one cannot say, There is _one Body of all Matters._ we familiarly say,
one _Body_ is bigger than another, but it sounds harsh (and I think is never
used) to say, one _Matter_ is bigger than another. Whence comes this then?
_Viz._ from hence, that though _Matter_ and _Body_ be not really distinct; but
where-ever there is one, there is the other: Yet _Matter_ and _Body,_ stand for
two different Conceptions, whereof the one is incomplete, and but a part of the
other. For _Body_ stands for a solid extended figured Substance, whereof Matter
is but a partial, and more confused Conception, it seeming to me to be used for
the Substance and Solidity of Body, without taking in its Extension and Figure:
And therefore it is that speaking of _Matter,_ we speak of it always as one,
because in Truth, it expresly contains nothing but the _Idea_ of a solid
Substance, which is every where the same, every where uniform: And therefore we
no more conceive, or speak of different Matters in the World, than we do of
different Solidities; though we both conceive, and speak of different Bodies,
because Extension and Figure are capable of variation. But since Solidity cannot
exist without Extension, and Figure, the taking Matter to be the name of
something really existing under that Precision, has no doubt produced those
obscure and unintelligible Discourses and Disputes, which have filled the Heads
and Books of Philosophers concerning _Materia Prima_; which Imperfection or
Abuse, how far it may concern a great many other general Terms, I leave to be
considered. This, I think, I may at least say, that we should have a great many
fewer Disputes in the World, if Words were taken for what they are, the signs of
our _Ideas_ only, and not for Things themselves. For when we argue about
_Matter,_ or any the like Term, we truly argue only about the _Idea_ we express
by that Sound, whether that precise _Idea_ agree to any thing really existing in
Nature, or no. And if Men would tell, what _Ideas_ they make their Words stand
for, there could not be half that Obscurity or Wrangling, in the search or
support of Truth, that there is.

{#16} But whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of Words, this, I am
sure, that by constant and familiar use, they charm Men into Notions far remote
from the Truth of Things. 'Twould be a hard Matter, to persuade any one, that
the Words which his Father or School-Master, the Parson of the Parish, or such a
Revend Doctor used, signified nothing that really existed in Nature: Which,
perhaps, is _none of the least Causes, that Men are so hardly drawn to quit
their Mistakes,_ even in Opinions purely philosophical, and where they have no
other Interest but Truth. For the Words, they have a long time been used to,
remaining firm in their Minds, 'tis no wonder, that the wrong Notions annexed to
them, should not be removed.

{#17} _Fifthly,_ Another _Abuse of Words, is the setting them in the place of
Things, which they do or can by no means signifie._ We may observe, that in the
general names of Substances, whereof the nominal Essences are only known to us,
when we put them into Propositions, and affirm or deny any thing about them, we
do most commonly tacitly suppose, or intend, they should stand for the real
Essence of a certain sort of Substances. For when a Man says Gold is malleable,
he means, and would insinuate something more than this, that what I call Gold is
malleable, (though truly it amounts to no more,) but would have this understood,
_viz._ that Gold; _i. e._ what has the real Essence of Gold is malleable, which
amounts to thus much, that Malleableness depends on, and is inseparable from the
real Essence of Gold. But a Man, not knowing wherein that real Essence consists,
the connexion in his Mind of Malleableness, is not truly with an Essence he
knows not, but only with the sound Gold he puts for it. Thus when we say, that
_Animal rationale_ is, and _Animal implume bibes latis unguibus_ is not a good
definition of a Man; 'tis plain, we suppose the Name _Man_ in this case to stand
for the real Essence of a Species, and would signifie, that a _rational Animal_
better described that real Essence, than _a two-leg'd Animal with broad Nails,
and without Feathers._ For else, why might not _Plato_ as properly make the
Word, $[greek text]$, or _Man,_ stand for his complex _Idea,_ made up of the
_Ideas_ of a Body, distinguished from others, by a certain shape and other
outward appearances, as _Aristotle,_ make the complex _Idea,_ to which he gave
the Name $[greek text]$, or _Man,_ of Body, and the Faculty of reasoning join'd
together, unless the name $[greek text]$, or _Man,_ were supposed to stand for
something else, than what it signifies, and the _Idea_ a Man professes he would
express by it?

{#18} 'Tis true, the names of Substances would be much more useful, and
Propositions made in them much more certain, were the real Essences of
Substances, the _Ideas_ in our Minds, which those Words signified. And 'tis for
want of those real Essences, that our Words convey so little Knowledge or
Certainty in our Discourses about them: And therefore the Mind, to remove that
Imperfection as much as it can, makes them, by a secret supposition, to stand
for a thing, having that real Essence, as if thereby it made some nearer
approaches to it. For though the Word _Man_ or _Gold,_ signifie nothing truly
but a complex _Idea_ of Properties, united together in one sort of Substances:
Yet there is scarce any Body in the use of these Words, but often supposes each
of those names to stand for a thing having the real Essence, on which those
Properties depend; which is so far from diminishing the Imperfection of our
Words, that by a plain Abuse, it adds to it: when we would make them stand for
something, which not being in our complex _Idea,_ the name we use, can no ways
be the sign of.

{#19} This shews us the Reason, _Why in mixed Modes any of the_ Ideas _that make
the Composition of the complex one, being left out, or changed, it is allowed to
be another thing,_ i. e. _to be of another Species,_ as is plain in
Chance-medly, Man-slaughter, Murther, Parricide, _&c._ the Reason whereof is,
because the complex _Idea_ signified by that name, is the real, as well as
nominal Essence; and there is no secret reference of that name to any other
Essence, but that. But _in Substances,_ it is _not_ so. For though in that
called Gold, one puts into his complex _Idea,_ what another leaves out; and
_Vice Versâ_: yet Men do not usually think, that therefore the Species is
changed: Because they secretly in their Minds refer that name, and suppose it
annexed to a real immutable Essence of a thing existing, on which those
Properties depend. He that adds to his complex _Idea_ of Gold, that of
Fixedness, or Solubility in _aq. regia,_ which he put not in it before, is not
thought to have changed the Species; but only to have a more perfect _Idea,_ by
adding another, which is always in _rerum natura,_ joined with those other, of
which his former complex _Idea_ consisted. But this reference of the name, to a
thing whereof we have not the _Idea,_ is so far from helping at all, that it
only serves the more to involve us in Difficulties. For by this tacit reference
to the real Essence of that Species of Bodies, the Word Gold (which by standing
for a more or less perfect Collection of simple _Ideas,_ serves to design that
sort of Body well enough in civil Discourse) comes to have no Signification at
all, being put for somewhat whereof we have no _Idea_ at all; and so can
signifie nothing at all, when the Body it self is away. For however it may be
thought all one; yet, if well considered, it will be found a quite different
thing, to argue about Gold in name, and about a parcel of the Body it self, _v.
g._ a piece of Leaf-Gold laid before us; though in Discourse, we are fain to
substitute the name for the thing.

{#20} That which, I think, very much disposes Men to substitute their names for
the real Essences of Species, is the supposition before mentioned, that Nature
works regularly in the Production of Things, and sets the Boundaries to each of
those Species, by giving exactly the same real internal Constitution to each
individual, which we rank under one general name. Whereas any one who observes
their different Qualities, can hardly doubt that many of the Individuals, called
by the same name, are in their internal Constitution, as different one from
another, as several of those which are ranked under different specifick Names.
_This supposition,_ however _that the same precise internal Constitution goes
always with the same specifick name, makes Men forward to take_ those _names for
the Representatives_ of those _real Essences,_ though indeed they signifie
nothing but the complex _Ideas_ they have in their Minds, when they use them. So
that, if I may so say, signifying one thing, and being supposed for, or put in
the place of another, they cannot but, in such a kind of use, cause a great deal
of Uncertainty in Men's Discourses; especially in those who have throughly
imbibed the Doctrine of substantial Forms, whereby they firmly imagine the
several Species of Things to be determined and distinguished.

{#21} But however preposterous and absurd it be, to make our names stand for
_Ideas_ we have not, or (which is all one) Essences that we know not, it being
in effect, to make our Words the signs of nothing; yet tis evident to any one,
whoever so little reflects on the use Men make of their Words, that there is
nothing more familiar. When a Man asks, whether this or that thing he sees, let
it be a Drill, or a monstrous _Foetus,_ be a _Man,_ or no; 'tis evident, the
Question is not, Whether that particular thing agree to his complex _Idea,_
expressed by the name _Man_: But whether it has in it the real Essence of a
Species of Things, which he supposes his name Man to stand for. _In which way of
using the names of Substances, there are these false suppositions_ contained.
_First,_ That there are certain precise Essences, according to which Nature
makes all particular Things, and by which they are distinguished into Species.
That every thing has a real Constitution, whereby it is what it is, and on which
its sensible Qualities depend, is past doubt: But I think it has been proved,
that this makes not the distinction of Species, as we rank them; nor the
boundaries of their names. _Secondly,_ This tacitly also insinuates, as if we
had _Ideas_ of these proposed Essences. For to what purpose else is it, to
enquire whether this or that thing have the real Essence of the Species Man, if
we did not suppose that there were such a specifick Essence known? Which yet is
utterly false: And therefore such Application of names, as would make them stand
for _Ideas_ we have not, must needs cause great disorder in Discourses and
Reasonings about them, and be a great inconvenience in our Communication by
Words.

{#22} _Sixthly,_ There remains yet another more general, though, perhaps, less
observed _Abuse of Words_; and that is, that Men having by a long and familiar
use annexed to them certain _Ideas,_ they are apt _to imagine so near and
necessary a connexion between the names and the signification_ they use in them,
that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is: and
therefore one ought to acquiesce in the Words delivered, as if it were past
doubt, that in the use of those common received sounds, the Speaker and Hearer
had necessarily the same precise _Ideas._ Whence presuming, that when they have
in Discourse used any Term, they have thereby, as it were, set before others the
very thing they talk of. And so likewise taking the Words of others, as
naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply
them to, they never trouble themselves to explain their own, or understand
clearly others meaning. From whence commonly proceeds Noise, and Wrangling,
without Improvement or Information; whilst Men take Words to be the constant
regular marks of agreed Notions, which in truth, are no more but the voluntary
and unsteady signs of their own _Ideas._ And yet Men think it strange, if in
Discourse, or (where it is often absolutely necessary) in Dispute, one sometimes
asks the meaning of their Terms: Though the Arguings, one may every day observe
in Conversation, make it evident, that there are few names of complex _Ideas,_
which any two Men use for the same just precise Collection. 'Tis hard to name a
Word, which will not be a clear instance of this. _Life_ is a Term, none more
familiar. Any one almost would take it for an Affront, to be asked what he meant
by it. And yet if it comes in Question, whether a Plant, that lies ready formed
in the Seed, have Life; whether the Embrio in an Egg before Incubation, or a Man
in a Swound without Sense or Motion, be alive or no, it is easie to perceive,
that a clear distinct settled _Idea_ does not always accompany the Use of so
known a Word, as that of _Life_ is. Some gross and confused Conceptions Men
indeed ordinarily have, to which they apply the common Words of their Language,
and that serves them well enough in their ordinary Discourses and Affairs: but
this is not sufficient for philosophical Enquiries. Knowledge and Reasoning
require precise determinate _Ideas._ And though Men will not not be so
importunately dull, as not to understand what others say, without demanding an
explication of their Terms; nor so troublesomely critical, as to correct others
in the use of the Words they receive from them; yet where Truth and Knowledge
are concerned in the Case, I know not what Fault it can be to desire the
explication of Words, whose Sense seems dubious: Or why a Man should be ashamed
to own his Ignorance, in what Sense another Man uses his Words, since he has no
other way of certainly knowing it, but by being informed. This Abuse of taking
Words upon Trust, has no where spread so far, nor with so ill Effects, as
amongst Men of Letters. The multiplication and obstinacy of Disputes, which has
so laid waste the intellectual World, is owing to nothing more, than to this ill
use of Words. For though it be generally believed, that there is great diversity
of Opinions in the Volumes and Variety of Controversies, the World is distracted
with; yet the most I can find, that the contending learned Men of different
Parties do, in their Arguings one with another, is, that they speak different
Languages. For I am apt to imagine, that when any of them quitting Terms, think
upon Things, and know what they think, they think all the same. Though perhaps,
what they would have, be different.

{#23} To conclude this Consideration of the Imperfection, and Abuse of Language;
the _ends of Language in our Discourse with others,_ being chiefly these three:
_First, To make known_ one Man's Thoughts or _Ideas_ to another. _Secondly,_ To
do it _with_ as much ease and _quickness,_ as is possible; and _Thirdly,_
Thereby _to convey_ the _Knowledge_ of Things. Language is either abused, or
deficient, when it fails in any of these Three. _First,_ Words fail in the first
of these Ends, and lay not open one Man's _Ideas_ to anothers view. _First,_
When Men have names in their Mouths without any clear and distinct _Ideas_ in
their Minds, whereof they are the signs: or _Secondly,_ When they apply the
common received names of any Language to _Ideas,_ to which the common use of
that Language does not apply them; or _Thirdly,_ When they apply them very
unsteadily, making them stand now for one, and by and by for another _Idea._

{#24} _Secondly,_ Men fail of conveying their Thoughts, with all the quickness
and ease that may be, when they have complex _Ideas,_ without having distinct
names for them. This is sometimes the Fault of the Language it self, which has
not in it a Sound yet apply'd to such a Signification: And sometimes the Fault
of the Man, who has not yet learn'd the name for the _Idea_ he would shew
another.

{#25} _Thirdly,_ There is no Knowledge of Things conveyed by Men's Words, when
their _Ideas_ agree not to the Reality of Things. Though it be a Defect, that
has its Original in our _Ideas,_ which are not so conformable to the Nature of
Things, as Attention, Study, and Application might make them; Yet it fails not
to extend it self to our Words too, when we use them as Signs of real Beings,
which yet never had any Reality or Existence.

{#26} § 26. _First,_ He that hath Words of any Language, without distinct
_Ideas_ in his Mind, to which he applies them, does, so far as he uses them in
Discourse, only make a noise without any Sense or Signification; and how learned
soever he may seem by the use of hard Words, or learned Terms, is not much more
advanced thereby in Knowledge, than he would be in Learning, who had nothing in
his Study, but the bare Titles of Books, without possessing the Contents of
them. For all such Words, however put into Discourse, according to the right
Construction of Grammatical Rules, or the Harmony of well turned Periods, do yet
amount to nothing but bare Sounds, and nothing else.

{#27} _Secondly,_ He that has complex _Ideas,_ without particular names for
them, would be in no better a Case than a Book-seller, who had in his Ware-house
Volumes that lay there unbound, and without Titles; which he could therefore
make known to others, only by shewing the loose sheets, and communicate them
only by Tale. This Man is hindred in his Discourse, for want of Words to
communicate his complex _Ideas,_ which he is therefore forced to make known by
an enumeration of the simple ones that compose them; and so is sain often to use
twenty Words, to express what another Man signifies in one.

{#28} _Thirdly,_ He that uses not constantly the same Sign for the same _Idea,_
but uses the same Words sometimes in one, and sometimes in another
Signification, ought to pass in the Schools and Conversation, for as fair a Man,
as he does in the Market and Exchange, who sells several Things under the same
name.

{#29} _Fourthly,_ He that applies the Words of any Language to _Ideas,_
different from those, to which the common use of that Country applies them,
however his own Understanding may be filled with Truth and Light, will not by
such Words be able to convey one jot of it to others, without defining. For
however, the Sounds are such as are familiarly known, and easily enter the Ears
of those who are accustomed to them; yet standing for other _Ideas_ than they
usually make them the signs of, they cannot make known his Thoughts who uses
them.

{#30} _Fifthly,_ He that hath _Ideas_ of Substances, which never existed, nor
have any correspondence with the real Nature of Things, to which he gives setled
and defined Names, may fill his Discourse, and, perhaps, another Man's Head,
with the fantastical Imaginations of his own Brain, but will be very far from
advancing thereby one jot, in real and true Knowledge.

{#31} He that hath Names without _Ideas,_ wants meaning in his Words, and speaks
only empty Sounds. He that hath complex _Ideas_ without Names for them, wants
Liberty and Dispatch in his Expressions, and is necessitated to use Periphrases.
He that uses his Words loosly and unsteadily, will either be not minded, or not
understood. He that applies his Names to _Ideas,_ different from their common
use, wants Propriety in his Language, and speaks Gibberish: And he that hath
_Ideas_ of Substances, disagreeing with the real Existence of Things, so far
wants the Materials of true Knowledge in his Understanding, and hath, instead
thereof, _Chimaeras._

{#32} In our Notions, concerning Substances, we are liable to all the former
Inconveniencies; _v. g._ 1. He that uses the word _Tarantula,_ without having
any Imagination or _Idea_ of what it stands for, pronounces a good Word; but so
long means nothing at all by it. 2. He that, in a new-discovered Country, shall
see several sorts of Animals and Vegetables, unknown to him before, may have as
true _Ideas_ of them, as of a Horse, or a Stag; but can speak of them only by a
description till he shall either take the Name the Natives call them by, or give
them one himself. 3. He that uses the word _Body_ sometimes for pure Extension,
and sometimes for Extension and Solidity together, will talk very fallaciously.
4. He that gives the name _Horse,_ to that _Idea_ which common usage calls
_Mule,_ talks improperly, and will not be understood. 5. He that thinks the name
_Centaur_ stands for some real Being, imposes on himself, and mistakes Words for
Things.

{#33} In Modes and Relations generally, we are liable only to the four first of
these Inconveniencies, (_viz._) 1. I may have in my Memory the Names of Modes,
as _Gratitude,_ or _Charity,_ and yet not have any precise _Ideas_ annexed in my
Thoughts to those Names. 2. I may have _Ideas,_ and not know the Names that
belong to them; _v. g._ I may have the _Idea_ of a Man's drinking till his
Colour and Humour be altered, till his Tongue trips, and his Eyes look red, and
his Feet fail him; and yet not know, that it is to be called _Drunkenness._ 3. I
may have the _Ideas_ of Vertues, or Vices, and Names also, but apply them amiss:
_v. g._ When I apply the name _Frugality,_ to that _Idea_ which others call and
signifie by this sound, _Covetousness._ 4. I may use any of those names with
inconstancy. 5. But in Modes and Relations, I cannot have _Ideas_ disagreeing to
the Existence of Things: for Modes being complex _Ideas,_ made by the Mind at
pleasure; and Relation being but my way of considering, or comparing two Things
together, and so also an _Idea_ of my own making, these _Ideas_ can scarce be
sound to disagree with any Thing existing; since they are not in the Mind, as
the Copies of Things regularly made by Nature, nor as Properties inseparably
slowing from the internal Constitution or Essence of any Substance; but, as it
were, Patterns lodg'd in my Memory, with Names annexed to them, to denominate
Actions and Relations by, as they come to exist. But the mistake is commonly in
my giving a wrong name to my Conceptions; and so using Words in a different
sense from other People, I am not understood, but am thought to have wrong
_Ideas_ of them, when I give wrong Names to them. Only if I put in my _Ideas_ of
mixed Modes or Relations, any inconsistent _Ideas_ together, I fill my Head also
with _Chimaeras_; since such _Ideas,_ if well examined, cannot so much as exist
in the Mind, much less any real Being, be ever denominated from them.

{#34} Since Wit and Fancy finds easier entertainment in the World, than dry
Truth and real Knowledge, _figurative Speeches,_ and allusion in Language, will
hardly be admitted, as _an_ imperfection or _abuse_ of it. I confess, in
Discourses, where we seek rather Pleasure and Delight, than Information and
Improvement, such Ornaments as are borrowed from them, can scarce pass for
Faults. But yet, if we would speak of Things as they are, we must allow, that
all the Art of Rhetorick, besides Order and Clearness, all the artificial and
figurative application of Words Eloquence hath invented, are for nothing else,
but to insinuate wrong _Ideas,_ move the Passions, and thereby mislead the
Judgment; and so indeed are perfect cheat: And therefore however laudable or
allowable Oratory may render them in Harangues and popular Addresses, they are
certainly, in all Discourses that pretend to inform and instruct, wholly to be
avoided; and where Truth and Knowledge are concerned, cannot but be thought a
great fault, either of the Language or Person that makes use of them. What, and
how various they are, I shall not trouble my self to take notice; the Books of
Rhetorick which abound in the World, will inform those who want to be informed:
Only I cannot but observe, how little the preservation and improvement of Truth
and Knowledge, is the Care and Concern of Mankind; since the Arts of Fallacy are
endow'd and preferred; and 'tis plain how much Men love to deceive, and be
deceived, since the great Art of Deceit and Errour, Rhetorick I mean, has its
established Professors, is publickly taught, and has always been had in great
Reputation. And, I doubt not, but it will be thought great boldness, if not
brutality in me, to have said thus much against it. _Eloquence,_ like the fair
Sex, has too prevailing Beauties in it, to suffer it self ever to be spoken
against: And 'tis in vain to find fault with those Arts of Deceiving, wherein
Men find pleasure to be Deceived.
