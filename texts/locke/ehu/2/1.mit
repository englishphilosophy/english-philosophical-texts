£2 _Of _Ideas_ in general, and their Original._ £2

{#1} EVery Man being conscious to himself, That he thinks, and that which his
Mind is employ'd about whilst thinking, being the _Ideas,_ that are there, 'tis
past doubt, than Men have in their Minds several _Ideas,_ such as are those
expressed by the words, _Whiteness, Hardness, Sweetness, Thinking, Motion, Man,
Elephant, Army, Drunkenness,_ and others: It is in the first place then to be
enquired, How he comes by them? I know it is a received Doctrine, That Men have
native _Ideas,_ and original Characters stamped upon their Minds, in their very
first being. This Opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose, what
I have said in the fore-going Book, will be much more easily admitted, when I
have shewed, whence the Understanding may get all the _Ideas_ it has, and by
what ways and degrees they may come into the Mind; for which I shall appeal to
every ones own Observation and Experience.

{#2} Let us then suppose the Mind to be, as we say, white Paper, void of all
Characters, without any _Ideas_; How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it
by that vast store, which the busie and boundless Fancy of Man has painted on
it, with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of Reason
and Knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, From _Experience_: In that, all
our Knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives it self. Our
Observation employ'd either about _external, sensible Objects; or about the
internal Operations of our Minds, perceived and reflected on by our selves, is
that, which supplies our Understandings with all the materials of thinking._
These two are the Fountains of Knowledge, from whence all the _Ideas_ we have,
or can naturally have, do spring.

{#3} First, _Our Senses,_ conversant about particular, sensible Objects, do
_convey into the Mind,_ several distinct _Perceptions_ of things, according to
those various ways, wherein those Objects do affect them: And thus we come by
those _Ideas,_ we have of _Yellow, White, Heat, Cold, Soft, Hard, Bitter,
Sweet,_ and all those which we call sensible qualities. This great Source, of
most of the _Ideas_ we have, depending wholly upon our Senses, and derived by
them to our Understanding, I call _SENSATION._

{#4} Secondly, The other Fountain, from which Experience furnisheth the
Understanding with _Ideas,_ is the _Perception of the Operations of our own
Minds_ within us, as it is employ'd about the _Idea's_ it has got; which
Operations, when the Soul comes to reflect on, and consider, do furnish the
Understanding with another sett of _Ideas,_ which could not be had from things
without; and such are, _Perception, Thinking, Doubting, Believing, Reasoning,
Knowing, Willing,_ and all the different actings of our own Minds; which we
being conscious of, and observing in our selves, do from these receive into our
Understanding, as distinct _Ideas,_ as we do from Bodies affecting our Senses.
This Source of _Ideas,_ every Man has wholly in himself: And though it be not
Sense, as having nothing to do with external Objects; yet it is very like it,
and might properly enough be call'd internal Sense. But as I call the other
_Sensation,_ so I call this _REFLECTION,_ the _Ideas_ it affords being such
only, as the Mind gets by reflecting on its own Operations within it self. By
_REFLECTION_ then, in the following part of this Discourse, I would be
understood to mean, that notice which the Mind takes of its own Operations, and
the manner of them, by reason whereof, there come to be _Ideas_ of these
Operations in the Understanding. These two, I say, _viz._ External, Material
things, as the Objects of _SENSATION_; and the Operations of our own Minds
within, as the Objects of _REFLECTION,_ are, to me, the only Originals, from
whence all our _Idea's_ take their beginnings. The term _Operations_ here, I use
in a large sence, as comprehending not barely the Actions of the Mind about its
_Ideas,_ but some sort of Passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the
satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.

{#5} The Understanding seems to me, not to have the least glimmering of any
_Ideas,_ which it doth not receive from one of these two: _Eternal Objects
furnish the Mind with the Ideas of sensible qualities,_ which are all those
different perceptions they produced in us: And the _Mind furnishes the
Understanding with Ideas of its own Operations._ These, when we have taken a
full survey of them, and their several modes, and the Compositions made out of
them, we shall find to contain all our whole stock of _Ideas;_ and that we have
nothing in our Minds, which did not come in, one of these two ways. Let any one
examine his own Thoughts, and throughly search into his Understanding, and then
let him tell me, Whether all the original _Ideas_ he has there, are any other
than of the Objects of his _Senses,_ or of the Operations of his Mind,
considered as Objects of his _Reflection_: and how great a mass of Knowledge
soever he imagines to be lodged there, he will, upon taking a strict view, see
that he has _not any Idea in his Mind, but what one of those two have
imprinted_; though, perhaps, with infinite variety compounded and enlarged, by
the Understanding, as we shall see hereafter.

{#6} He that attentively considers the state of a _Child,_ at his first coming
into the World, will have little reason to think him stored with plenty of
_Ideas,_ that are to be the matter of his future Knowledge. 'Tis by degrees he
comes to be furnished with them: And though the _Ideas_ of obvious and familiar
qualities, imprint themselves, before the Memory begins to keep a Register of
Time and Order, yet 'tis often so late before some unusual qualities come in the
way, that there are few Men that cannot recollect the beginning of their
acquaintance with them: And if it were worth while, no doubt a Child might be so
ordered, as to have but a very few, even of the ordinary _Ideas,_ till he were
grown up to a Man. But being surrounded with Bodies, that perpetually and
diversly affect us, variety of _Idea's,_ whether care be taken about it, or no,
are imprinted on the Minds of Children. _Light,_ and _Colours,_ are busie and at
hand everywhere, when the Eye is but open; _Sounds,_ and some _tangible
Qualities,_ fail not to sollicite their proper Senses, and force an entrance to
the Mind; but yet, I think, it will be granted easily, That if a Child were kept
in a place, where he never saw any other but Black and White, till he were a
Man, he would have no more _Ideas_ of Scarlet or Green, than he that from his
Childhood never tasted an Oyster, or a Pine-Apple, has of those particular
Relishes.

{#7} Men then come to be furnished, with sewer or more simple _Ideas_ from
without, according as the _Objects,_ they converse with afford greater or lesser
variety; and from the Operation of their Minds within, according as they more or
less _reflect_ on them. For, though he that contemplates the Operations of his
Mind, cannot but have plain and clear _Ideas_ of them; yet unless he turn his
Thoughts that way, and considers them _attentively,_ he will no more have clear
and distinct _Ideas_ of all the _Operations of his Mind,_ and all that may be
observed therein, than he will have all the particular _Ideas_ of any Landscape,
or of the Parts and Motions of a Clock, who will not turn his Eyes to it, and
with attention heed all the Parts of it. The Picture, or Clock may be so placed,
that they may come in his way every Day; but yet he will have but a confused
_Idea_ of all the Parts they are made up of, till he _applies himself with
attention,_ to consider them each in particular.

{#8} And hence we see the Reason, why 'tis pretty late before most Children get
_Ideas_ of the Operations of their own Minds; and some have not any very clear,
or perfect _Ideas_ of the greatest part of them all their Lives. Because, though
they pass there continually; yet like floating Visions, they make not deep
Impressions enough, to leave in the Mind clear and distinct, lasting _Ideas,_
till the Understanding turn inwards upon its self, and _reflect_ on its own
_Operations,_ and make them the Object of its own Contemplation. Whereas
Children at their first coming into the World, seek particularly after nothing,
but what may ease their Hunger, or other Pain: but take all other Objects as
they come, are generally pleased with all new ones, that are not painful; and so
growing up in a constant attention to outward Sensations, seldom make any
considerable Reflection on what passes within them, till they come to be of
riper Years; and some scarce ever at all.

{#9} To ask, _at what time a Man has first any_ Ideas, is to ask, when he begins
to perceive, having _Ideas_ and Perception being the same thing. I know it is an
Opinion, that the Soul always thinks, and that it has the actual Perception of
_Ideas_ in its self constantly, as long as it exists; and that actual thinking
is as inseparable from the Soul, as actual Extension is from the Body; which if
true, to enquire after the beginning of a Man's _Idea's,_ is the same, as to
enquire after the beginning of his Soul. For by this Account, Soul and _Ideas,_
as Body and Extension, will begin to exist both at the same time.

{#10} But whether the Soul be supposed to exist antecedent to, or coeval with,
or some time after the first Rudiments of Organisation, or the beginnings of
Life in the Body, I leave to be disputed by those, who have better thought of
that matter. I confess my self, to have one of those dull Souls, that doth not
perceive it self always to contemplate its _Ideas,_ nor can conceive it any more
necessary for the _Soul always to think,_ than for the Body always to move: the
perception of _Idea's,_ being (as I conceive) to the Soul, what motion is to the
Body, not its Essence, but Operation: And therefore, though thinking be supposed
never so much the proper Action of the Soul; yet it is not necessary, to
suppose, that it should be always thinking, always in Action. That, perhaps, is
the Privilege of the infinite Author and Preserver of all things, _who never
slumbers nor sleeps_; but is not competent to any finite Being, at least not to
the Soul of Man. We know certainly by Experience, that we sometimes think, and
thence draw this infallible Consequence, That there is something in us, that has
a Power to think: But whether that Substance perpetually thinks, or no, we can
be no farther assured, than Experience informs us. For to say, that actual
thinking is essential to the Soul, and inseparable from it, is, to beg what is
in Question, and not to prove it by Reasons; which is necessary to be done, if
it be not a self-evident Proposition. But whether this, _That the Soul always
thinks,_ be a self-evident Proposition, that every Body assents to at first
hearing, I appeal to Mankind.

{#11} I grant that the Soul in a waking Man is never without thought, because it
is the condition of being awake: But whether sleeping without dreaming be not an
Affection of the whole Man, Mind as well as Body, may be worth a waking Man's
Consideration; it being hard to conceive, that any thing should think, and not
be conscious of it. If the _Soul_ doth _think in a sleeping Man,_ without being
conscious of it, I ask, whether, during such thinking, it has any Pleasure or
Pain, or be capable of Happiness or Misery? I am sure the Man is not, no more
than the Bed or Earth he lies on. For to be happy or miserable without being
conscious of it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible. Or if it be
possible, that the Soul can, whilst the Body is sleeping, have its Thinking,
Enjoyments, and Concerns; its Pleasure or Pain apart, which the Man is not
conscious of, nor partakes in, It is certain, that _Socrates_ asleep, and
_Socrates_ awake, is not the same Person; but his Soul when he sleeps, and
_Socrates_ the Man consisting of Body and Soul when he is waking, are two
Persons: Since waking _Socrates,_ has no Knowledge of, or Concernment for that
Happiness, or Misery of his Soul, which it enjoys alone by it self whilst he
sleeps, without perceiving any thing of it, no more than he has for the
Happiness, or Misery of a Man in the _Indies,_ whom he knows not. For if we take
wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and Sensations, especially of
Pleasure and Pain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to
know wherein to place personal Identity.

{#12} The Soul, during sound Sleep, thinks, say these Men. _Whilst it thinks_
and perceives, it is capable certainly of those of Delight or Trouble, as well
as any other Perceptions; and _it must necessarily be conscious of its own
Perceptions._ But it has all this a part: The sleeping Man, 'tis plain, is
conscious of nothing of all this. Let us suppose then the Soul of _Castor,_
whilst he is sleeping, retired from his Body, which is no impossible Supposition
for the Men I have here to do with, who so liberally allow Life, without a
thinking Soul to all other Animals. These Men cannot then judge it is
impossible, or a contradiction, That the Body should live without the Soul; nor
that the Soul subsists and thinks, or has Perception, even Perception of
Happiness or Misery, without the Body. Let us then, as I say, suppose the Soul
of _Castor_ separated, during his Sleep, from his Body, to think apart. Let us
suppose too, that it chooses for its Scene of Thinking, the Body of another Man,
_v. g. Pollux,_ who is sleeping without a Soul: For if _Castor_'s Soul, can
think whilst _Castor_ is asleep, what _Castor_ is never conscious of, 'tis no
matter what Place it chooses to think in. We have here then the Bodies of two
Men with only one Soul between them, which we will suppose to sleep and wake by
turns; and the Soul still thinking in the waking Man, whereof the sleeping Man
is never conscious, has never the least Perception. I ask then, Whether _Castor_
and _Pollux,_ thus, with only one Soul between them, which thinks and perceives
in one, what the other is never conscious of, nor is not concerned for, are not
two as distinct Persons, as _Castor_ and _Hercules_; or, as _Socrates,_ and
_Plato_ were? And whether one of them might not be very happy, and the other
very miserable? Just by the same reason, they make the Soul and the Man two
persons, who make the Soul think apart, what the Man is not conscious of. For, I
suppose, no body will make Identity of persons, to consist in the Soul's being
united to the very same numerical particles of matter: For if that be necessary
to Identity, 'twill be impossible, in that constant flux of the particles of our
Bodies, that any Man should be the same person, two days, or two moments
together.

{#13} Thus, methinks, every drousie nod shakes their Doctrine, who teach, That
the Soul is always thinking. Those, at least, who do at any time _sleep without
dreaming,_ can never be convinced, That their Thoughts are sometimes for four
hours busie without their knowing of it; and if they are taken in the very act,
waked in the middle of that sleeping contemplation, can give no manner of
account of it.

{#14} 'Twill perhaps be said, That the _Soul thinks,_ even _in_ the soundest
_Sleep, but the Memory retains it not._ That the Soul in a sleeping Man should
be this moment busie a thinking, and the next moment in a waking Man, not
remember, nor be able to recollect one jot of all those Thoughts, is very hard
to be conceived, and would need some better Proof than bare Assertion to make it
be believed. For who can without any more ado, but being barely told so,
imagine, That the greatest part of Men, do, during all their Lives, for several
hours every Day, think of something, which if they were asked, even in the
middle of these Thoughts, they could remember nothing at all of? Most Men, I
think, pass a great part of their Sleep without dreaming. I once knew a Man,
that was bred a Scholar, and had no bad Memory, who told me, he had never
dream'd in his Life, till he had that Fever, he was then newly recovered of,
which was about the Five or Six and Twentieth Year of his Age. I suppose the
World affords more such Instances: At least every ones Acquaintance, will
furnish him with Examples enough of such, as pass most of their Nights without
dreaming.

{#15} _To think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very
useless sort of thinking_: and the Soul in such a state of thinking, does very
little, if at all, excel that of a Looking-glass, which constantly receives
variety of Images, or _Ideas,_ but retains none; they disappear and vanish, and
there remain no footsteps of them; the Looking-glass is never the better for
such _Ideas,_ nor the Soul for such Thoughts. Perhaps it will be said, that in a
waking Man, the materials of the Body are employ'd, and made use of, in
thinking; and that the memory of Thoughts, is retained by the impressions that
are made on the Brain, and the traces there left after such thinking; but that
in the _thinking of the Soul,_ which is not perceived _in a sleeping Man,_ there
the Soul thinks apart, and _making no use_ of the Organs of _the Body, leaves no
impressions on it, and consequently no memory_ of such Thoughts. Not to mention
again the absurdity of two distinct Persons, which follows from this
Supposition, I answer farther, That whatever _Ideas_ the Mind can receive, and
contemplate without the help of the Body, it is reasonable to conclude, it can
retain without the help of the Body too, or else the Soul, or any separate
Spirit, will have but little advantage by thinking. If it has no memory of its
own Thoughts; if it cannot record them for its use, and be able to recall them
upon any occasion; if it cannot reflect upon what is past, and make use of its
former Experiences, Reasonings, and Contemplations, to what purpose does it
think? They who make the Soul a thinking Thing, at this rate will not make it a
much more noble Being, than those do, whom they condemn for allowing it to be
nothing but the subtilest parts of Matter. Characters drawn on Dust, that the
first breath of wind effaces; or Impressions made on a heap of Atoms, or animal
Spirits, are altogether as useful, and render the Subject as noble, as the
Thoughts of a Soul that perish in thinking; that once out of sight, are gone for
ever, and leave no memory of themselves behind them. Nature never makes
excellent things, for mean or no uses: and it is hardly to be conceived, that
our infinitely wise Creator, should make so admirable a Faculty, as the power of
Thinking, that Faculty which comes nearest the Excellency of his own
incomprehensible Being, to be so idlely and uselesly employ'd, at least ¼ part
of its time here, as to think constantly, without remembring any of those
Thoughts, without doing any good to its self or others, or being any way useful
to any other part of the Creation. If we will examine it, we shall not find, I
suppose, the motion of dull and sensless matter, any where in the Universe, made
so little use of, and so wholly thrown away.

{#16} 'Tis true, we have sometimes instances of Perception, whilst we are
_asleep,_ and retain the memory of those _Thoughts_: but how _extravagant_ and
incoherent for the most part they are; how little conformable to the Perfection
and Order of a rational Being, those who are acquainted with Dreams, need not be
told. This I would willingly be satisfied in, Whether the Soul, when it thinks
thus apart, and as it were separate from the Body, acts less rationally then,
when conjointly with it, or no: If its separate Thoughts be less rational, then
these Men must say, That the Soul owes the perfection of rational thinking to
the Body: If it does not, 'tis a wonder that our Dreams should be, for the most
part, so frivolous and irrational; and that the Soul should retain none of its
more rational Soliloquies and Meditations.

{#17} Those who so confidently tell us, That the Soul always actually thinks, I
would they would also tell us, what those _Ideas_ are, that are in the Soul of a
Child, before, or just at the union with the Body, before it hath received any
by _Sensation._ The _Dreams_ of sleeping Men, _are,_ as I take it, all _made up
of the waking Man's Ideas,_ though, for the most part, oddly put together. 'Tis
strange, if the Soul has _Ideas_ of its own, that it derived not from
_Sensation_ or _Reflection,_ (as it must have, if it thought before it received
any impressions from the Body) that it should never, in its private thinking,
(so private, that the Man himself perceives it not) retain any of them, the very
moment it wakes out of them, and then make the Man glad with new discoveries.
Who can find it reason, that the Soul should, in its retirement, during sleep,
have so many hours thoughts, and yet never light on any of those _Ideas_ it
borrowed not from _Sensation_ or _Reflection,_ or at least preserve the memory
of none, but such, which being occasioned from the Body, must needs be less
natural to a Spirit? 'Tis strange, the Soul should never once in a Man's whole
life, recal over any of its pure, native Thoughts, and those _Ideas_ it had
before it borrowed any thing from the Body; never bring into the waking Man's
view, any other _Ideas,_ but what have a tangue of the Cask, manifestly derive
their Original from that union. If it always thinks, and so had _Ideas_ before
it was united, or before it received any from the Body, 'tis not to be supposed,
but that during sleep, it recollects its native _Ideas,_ and during that
retirement from communicating with the Body, whilst it thinks by it self, the
_Ideas_ it is busied about, should be sometimes, at least those more natural and
congenial ones had in it self, underived from the Body, or its own operations
about them, which since the waking Man never remembers, we must from this
Hypothesis conclude, that Memory belongs only to _Ideas,_ derived from the Body,
and the Operations of the Mind about them, or else that the Soul remembers
something that the Man does not.

{#18} I would be glad also to learn from these men, who so confidently
pronounce, that the humane Soul, or, which is all one, that a man always thinks,
how they come to know it; nay, _how they come to know that they themselves
think, when they themselves do not perceive it._ This, I am afraid, is to be
sure, without proofs; and to know, without perceiving: 'Tis, I suspect, a
confused Notion, taken up to serve an Hypothesis; and none of those clear
Truths, that either their own Evidence force us to admit, or common Experience
makes it impudence to deny. For the most that can be said of it, is, That 'tis
possible the Soul may always think, but not always retain it in memory: And, I
say, it is as possible, that the Soul may not always think; and much more
probable, that it should sometimes not think, than that it should often think,
and that a long while together, and not be conscious to it self the next moment
after, that it had thought.

{#19} To suppose the Soul to think, and the Man not perceive it, is, as has been
said, to make two persons in one man: And if one consider well these mens way of
speaking, one shall be lead into a suspicion, that they do so. For they who tell
us, that the Soul always thinks, do never, that I remember, say, That a man
always thinks. Can the Soul think, and not the Man? Or a Man think, and not be
conscious of it? This, perhaps, would be suspected of _Iargon_ in others. If
they say, The man thinks always, but is not always conscious of it; they may as
well say, His Body is extended, without having parts. For 'tis altogether as
intelligible to say, that any thing is extended without parts, as that any thing
_thinks, without being conscious of it_; without perceiving, that it does so.
They who talk thus, may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their
Hypothesis, say, That a man is always hungry, but that he does not always feel
it: Whereas hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking consists in
being conscious that one thinks. If they say, That a man is always conscious to
himself of thinking; I ask, How they know it? Consciousness is the perception of
what passes in a man's own mind. Can another man perceive, that I am conscious
of any thing, when I perceive it not my self? No man's Knowledge here, can go
beyond his Experience. Wake a man out of a sound sleep, and ask him, What he was
that moment thinking on. If he himself be conscious of nothing he then thought
on, he must be a notable Diviner of Thoughts, that can assure him, that he was
thinking: May he not with more reason assure him, he was not asleep? This is
something beyond Philosophy; and it cannot be less than Revelation, that
discovers to another, Thoughts in my mind, when I can find none there my self:
And they must needs have a penetrating sight, who can certainly see, that I
think, when I cannot perceive it my self, and declare, That I do not; and yet
can see, that a Dog, or an Elephant, do not think, though they give all the
demonstration of it imaginable, except only telling us, that they do so. This
some may suspect to be a step beyond the _Rosecrucians_; it seeming easier to
make ones self invisible to others, than to make another's thoughts visible to
me, which are not visible to himself. But 'tis but defining the Soul to be a
substance, that always thinks, and the business is done. If such a definition be
of any Authority, I know not what it can serve for, but to make many men
suspect, That they have no Souls at all, since they find a good part of their
Lives pass away without thinking. For no Definitions, that I know, no
Suppositions of any Sect, are of force enough to destroy constant Experience;
and, perhaps, 'tis the affectation of knowing beyond what we perceive, that
makes so much useless dispute, and noise, in the World.

{#20} I see no Reason therefore to believe, that the _Soul thinks before the
Senses have furnished it with Ideas_ to think on; and as those are increased,
and retained; so it comes, by Exercise, to improve its Faculty of thinking in
the several parts of it, as well as afterwards, by compounding those _Ideas,_
and reflecting on its own Operations, it increases its Stock as well as
Facility, in remembring, imagining, reasoning, and other modes of thinking.

{#21} He that will suffer himself, to be informed by Observation and Experience,
and not make his own Hypothesis the Rule of Nature, will find few Signs of a
Soul accustomed to much thinking in a new born Child, and much fewer of any
Reasoning at all. And yet it is hard to imagine, that the rational Soul should
think so much, and not reason at all. And he that will consider, that Infants,
newly come into the World, spend the greatest part of their time in Sleep, and
are seldom awake, but when either Hunger calls for the Teat, or some Pain, (the
most importunate of all Sensations) or some other violent _Idea,_ forces the
mind to perceive, and attend to it, He, I say, who considers this, will,
perhaps, find Reason to imagine, That _a Foetus in the Mother's Womb, differs
not much from the State of a Vegetable_; but passes the greatest part of its
time without Perception or Thought, doing very little, but sleep in a Place,
where it needs not seek for Food, and is surrounded with Liquor, always equally
soft, and near of the same Temper; where the Eyes have no Light, and the Ears,
so shut up, are not very susceptible of Sounds; and where there is little or no
variety, or change of Objects to move the Senses.

{#22} Follow _a Child_ from its Birth, and observe the alterations that time
makes; and you shall find, as the mind by the Senses comes more and more to be
furnished with _Ideas,_ it comes to be more and more awake; thinks more, the
more it has matter to think on. After some time, it begins to know the Objects,
which being most familiar with it, have made lasting Impressions. Thus it comes,
by degrees, to know the Persons it daily converses with, and distinguish them
from Strangers; which are Instances and Effects of its coming to retain and
distinguish the _Ideas_ the Senses convey to it: And so we may observe, how the
Mind, _by degrees,_ improves in these, and _advances_ to the Exercise of those
other Faculties of _Enlarging, Compounding,_ and _Abstracting_ its _Ideas,_ and
of reasoning about them, and reflecting upon all these, of which, I shall have
occasion to speak more hereafter.

{#23} If it shall be demanded then, _When a Man begins to have any Ideas?_ I
think, the true Answer is, When he first has any _Sensation._ For since there
appear not to be any _Ideas_ in the Mind, before the Senses have conveyed any
in, I conceive that _Ideas_ in the Understanding, are coeval with _Sensation_;
which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as makes
it be taken notice of in the Understanding.

{#24} The _Impressions_ then, that are made on our _Senses_ by outward Objects,
that are extrinsical to the Mind, and _its own Operations,_ about these
Impressions _reflected_ on by its self, as proper Objects to be contemplated by
it, _are,_ I conceive, _the Original of all Knowledge_; and the first Capacity
of Humane Intellect, is, That the Mind is fitted to receive the Impressions made
on it; either, through the _Senses,_ by outward Objects; or by its own
Operations, when it _reflects_ on them. This is the first step a Man makes
towards the Discovery of any thing, and the Groundwork, whereon to build all
those Notions, which ever he shall have naturally in this World. All those
sublime Thoughts, which towre above the Clouds, and reach as high as Heaven its
self, take their Rise and Footing here: In all that great Extent wherein the
mind wanders, in those remote Speculations, it may seem to be elevated with, it
stirs not one jot beyond those _Ideas,_ which _Sense_ or _Reflection,_ have
offered for its Contemplation.

{#25} In this Part, the _Understanding_ is meerly _passive;_ and whether or no,
it will have these Beginnings, and as it were materials of Knowledge, is not in
its own Power. For the Objects of our Senses, do, many of them, obtrude their
particular _Ideas_ upon our minds, whether we will or no: And the Operations of
our minds, will not let us be without, at least some obscure Notions of them. No
Man, can be wholly ignorant of what he does, when he thinks. These _simple
Ideas,_ when offered to the mind, _the Understanding can_ no more refuse to
have, nor alter, when they are imprinted, nor blot them out, and make new ones
in it self, than a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the Images or
_Ideas,_ which the Objects set before it do therein produce. As the Bodies that
surround us, do diversly affect our Organs, the mind is forced to receive the
Impressions; and cannot avoid the Perception of those _Ideas,_ that are annexed
to them.
