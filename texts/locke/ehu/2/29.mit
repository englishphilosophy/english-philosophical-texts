£2 _Of Clear and Obscure, Distinct and Confused Ideas._ £2

{#1} HAving shewed the Original of our _Ideas,_ and considered the several sorts
of them, as Simple and Complex; and shewed the difference in Complex ones,
betwixt those of Modes, Relations, and Substances, all which, I think, is
necessary to be done by any one, who would acquaint himself throughly with the
progress of the Mind, in its Apprehension and Knowledge of Things, it will,
perhaps, be thought I have dwelt long enough upon the Examination of _Ideas._ I
must, nevertheless, crave leave to offer some few other Considerations
concerning them. The first is, That some are _clear,_ and others _obscure_; some
_distinct,_ and others _confused._

{#2} Perception of the Mind, being most aptly explained by Words relating to the
Sight, we shall best understand what is meant by Clear, and Obscure in our
_Ideas,_ by reflecting on what we call Clear and Obscure in the Objects of
Sight. Light being that which discovers to us visible Objects, we give the name
of _Obscure,_ to that, which is not placed in a Light, sufficient to discover
minutely to us the Figure and Colours, which are observable in it, and which, in
a better Light, would be discernable. Thus our _simple Ideas_ are _clear,_ when
they are such as the Objects themselves, from whence they were taken, did, in a
well-ordered Sensation or Perception, present them. Whilst the Memory retains
them thus, and can produce them so, to the Mind, when-ever it has occasion to
consider them, they are clear _Ideas._ So far as they either want any thing of
that original Exactness, or have lost any of their first Freshness, and are, as
it were, faded or tarnished by Time, so far are they obscure. _Complex Ideas,_
as they are made up of Simple ones: so they are _clear,_ when the _Ideas,_ that
go to their Composition, are clear; and the Number and Order of those Simple
_Ideas,_ that are the Ingredients of any Complex one, is determinate and
certain.

{#3} The _cause of Obscurity_ in simple _Ideas,_ seems to be either dull Organs;
or very slight and transient Impressions made by the Objects; or else a weakness
in the Memory, not able to retain them as received. For to return again to
visible Objects, to help us to apprehend this matter. If the Organs, or
Faculties of Perception, like Wax over-hardned with Cold, will not receive the
Impression of the Seal, from the usual impulse wont to imprint it; or, like Wax
of a temper too soft, will not hold it well, when well imprinted; or else
supposing the Wax of a temper fit, but the Seal not applied with a sufficient
force, to make a clear Impression: In any of these cases, the print left by the
Seal, will be obscure. This I suppose, needs no application to make it plainer.

{#4} As a clear _Idea_ is that whereof the Mind has a full and evident
perception, so a _distinct Idea_ is that wherein the Mind perceives a difference
from all other; and a _confused Idea_ is such an one, as is not sufficiently
distinguishable from another, from which it ought to be different.

{#5} If no _Idea_ be confused, but such as is not sufficiently distinguishable
from another, from which it should be different, it will be hard, may any one
say, to find anywhere a confused _Idea._ For let any _Idea_ be as it will, it
can be no other but such as the Mind perceives it to be; and that very
perception, sufficiently distinguishes it from all other _Ideas,_ which cannot
be other, _i. e._ different, without being perceived to be so. No _Idea_
therefore can be undistinguishable from another, from which it ought to be
different, unless you would have it different from it self: for from all other,
it is evidently different.

{#6} To remove this difficulty, and to help us to conceive aright, what it is,
that makes the confusion, _Ideas_ are at any time chargeable with, we must
consider, that Things are supposed different enough to have different Names,
whereby to be marked, and discoursed of apart, upon any occasion: And there is
nothing more evident, than that the greatest part of different Names, are
supposed to stand for different Things. Now every _Idea_ a Man has, being
visibly what it is, and distinct from all other _Ideas,_ but it self, that which
makes it _confused_ is, when it is such, that it may as well be called by
another Name, as that which it is expressed by: the difference which keep the
Things (to be ranked under those two different Names) distinct, and makes them
belong rather to the one, than the other of them, being left out; and so the
distinction, which was intended to be kept up by those different Names, is quite
lost.

{#7} The _Defaults which_ usually _occasion_ this _Confusion,_ I think, are
chiefly these following: _First,_ When any complex _Idea_ (for 'tis complex
_Ideas_ that are most liable to confusion) is made up of _100 small a number of
simple Ideas,_ and such only as are common to other Things, whereby the
differences, that make it deserve a different Name, are left out. Thus he, that
has an _Idea_ made up of barely the simple ones of a Beast with Spots, has but a
confused _Idea_ of a Leopard, it not being thereby sufficiently distinguished
from a Lynx, and several other sorts of Beasts that are spotted. So that such an
_Idea,_ though it hath the peculiar Name Leopard, is not distinguishable from
those designed by the Names Lynx, or Panther, and may as well come under the
Name Lynx, as Leopard. How much the custom of defining of Words by general
terms, contributes to make the _Ideas_ we would express by them, confused and
undetermined, I leave others to consider. This is evident, that confused _Ideas_
are such as render the Use of Words uncertain, and take away the benefit of
distinct Names. When the _Ideas,_ for which we used different terms, have not a
difference answerable to their distinct Names, and so cannot be distinguished by
them, there it is that they are truly confused.

{#8} §.8. _Secondly,_ Another default, which makes our _Ideas_ confused, is,
when though the particulars that make up any _Idea,_ are in number enough; yet
they are so _jumbled together,_ that it is not easily discernable, whether it
more belongs to the Name that is given it, than to any other. There is nothing
properer to make us conceive this Confusion, than a sort of Pictures usually
shewn, as surprizing Pieces of Art, wherein the Colours, as they are laid by the
Pencil on the Table itself, markout very odd and unusual Figures, and have no
discernable order in their Position. This Draught, thus made up of parts,
wherein no Symmetry nor Order appears, is, in it self, no more a confused Thing,
than the picture of a cloudy Sky; wherein though there be as little order of
Colours, or Figures to be found, yet no body thinks it a confused Picture. What
is it then, that makes it be thought confused, since the want of Symmetry does
not: as it is plain it does not; for another Draught made, barely in imitation
of this, could not be called confused? I answer, That which makes it be thought
confused, is the applying it to some Name, to which it does no more discernably
belong, than to some other; _v. g._ when it is said to be the Picture of a Man,
or _Caesar,_ then any one with reason counts it confused: because it is not
discernable, in that state, to belong more to the name Man, or _Caesar,_ than to
the name Baboon, or _Pompey_; which are supposed to stand for different _Ideas,_
from those signified by Man, or _Caesar._ But when a cylindrical Mirrour, placed
right, hath reduced those irregular Lines on the Table, into their due order and
proportion, then the Confusion ceases, and the Eye presently sees, that it is a
Man, or _Caesar; i. e_ that it belongs to those Names; and that it is
sufficiently distinguishable from a Baboon, or _Pompey; i. e._ from the _Ideas_
signified by those Names. Just thus it is with our _Ideas,_ which are, as it
were, the Pictures of Things. No one of these mental Draughts, however the parts
are put together, can be called confused, (for they are plainly discernible as
they are,) till it be ranked under some ordinary Name, to which it cannot be
discerned to belong, any more than it does to some other Name, of an allowed
different signification.

{#9} _Thirdly,_ A third defect that frequently gives the name of Confused, to
our _Ideas,_ is when any one of them is _uncertain, and undetermined._ Thus we
may observe Men, who not forbearing to use the ordinary Words of their Language,
till they have learn'd their precise signification, change the _Idea,_ they make
this or that term stand for, almost as often as they use it. He that does this,
out of uncertainty of what he should leave out, or put into his _Idea_ of
_Church,_ or _Idolatry,_ every time he thinks of either, and holds not steady to
any one precise Combination of _Ideas,_ that makes it up, is said to have a
confused _Idea_ of Idolatry, or the Church: Though this be still for the same
reason that the former, _viz._ Because a mutable _Idea_ (if we will allow it to
be one _Idea_) cannot belong to one Name, rather than another; and so loses the
distinction, that distinct Names are designed for.

{#10} By what has been said, we may observe how much _Names,_ as supposed steady
signs of Things, and by their difference to stand for, and keep Things distinct,
that in themselves are different, are the _occasion if denominating Ideas
distinct or confused,_ by a secret and unobserved reference, the Mind makes of
its _Ideas_ to such Names. This, perhaps, will be fuller understood, after what
I say of Words, in the Third Book, has been read and considered. But without
taking notice of such a reference of _Ideas_ to distinct Names, as the signs of
distinct Things, it will be hard to say what a confused _Idea_ is. And therefore
when a Man designs, by any Name, a sort of Things, or any one particular Thing,
distinct from all others, the complex _Idea_ he annexes to that Name, is the
more distinct, the more particular the _Ideas_ are, and the greater and more
determinate the number and order of them is, whereof it is made up. For the more
it has of these, the more has it still of the perceivable differences, whereby
it is kept separate and distinct from all _Ideas_ belonging to other Names, even
those that approach nearest to it, and thereby all confusion with them is
avoided.

{#11} _Confusion,_ making it a difficulty to separate two Things that should be
separated, _concerns always two Ideas_; and those most, which most approach one
another. Whenever therefore we suspect any _Idea_ to be confused, we must
examine what other it is in danger to be confounded with, or which it cannot
easily be separated from, and that will always be found an _Idea_ belonging to
another Name, and so should be a different Thing, from which yet it is not
sufficiently distinct; being either the same with it, or making a part of it,
or, at least, as properly call'd by that Name, as the other it is ranked under;
and so keeps not that difference from that other _Idea,_ which the different
Names import.

{#12} This, I think, is the confusion proper to _Ideas_; which still carries
with it a secret reference to Names. At least if there be any other confusion of
_Ideas,_ this is that which most of all disorders Mens Thoughts and Discourses:
_Ideas,_ as ranked under Names, being those that for the most part Men reason of
within themselves, and always those which they communicate about, with others.
And therefore where there are supposed two different _Ideas,_ marked by two
different Names, which are not as distinguishable as the Sounds that stand for
them, there never fails to be confusion: And where any _Ideas_ are distinct, as
the _Ideas_ of those two Sounds they are marked by, there can be between them no
_confusion. The way to prevent it,_ is to collect and unite into our complex
_Idea,_ as precisely as is possible, all those Ingredients, whereby it is
differenced from others; and to them so united in a determinate number, and
order, apply steadily the same Name. But this neither accommodating Mens ease or
vanity, or serving any design, but that of naked Truth, which is not always the
thing aimed at, such exactness, is rather to be wished, than hoped for. And
since the loose application of Names, to uncertain, and almost no _Ideas,_
serves both to cover our own Ignorance, as well as to perplex and confound
others, which goes for Learning and Superiority in Knowledge, it is no wonder
that most Men should use it themselves, whilst they complain of it in others.
Though yet, I think, no small part of the confusion, to be found in the Notions
of Men, might, by care and ingenuity, be avoided; yet I am far from thinking it
every-where wilful. Some _Ideas_ are so complex, and made up of so many parts,
that the Memory does not easily retain the very same precise Combination of
simple _Ideas,_ under one Name; much less are we able constantly to divine for
what precise complex _Idea_ such a Name stands in another Man's use of it. From
the first of these, follows confusion in a Man's own Reasonings and Opinions
within himself; from the latter, frequent confusion in discoursing and arguing
with others. But having more at large treated of Words, their Defects and Abuses
in the following Book, I shall here say no more of it.

{#13} Our _complex Ideas_ being made up of Collections, and so variety of simple
ones, _may_ accordingly _be very clear and distinct in one part, and very
obscure and confused in another._ In a Man who speaks of a _Chiliaderon,_ or a
Body of a thousand sides, the _Idea_ of the Figure may be very confused, though
that of the Number be very distinct: so that he being able to discourse, and
demonstrate concerning that part of his complex _Idea,_ which depends upon the
Number of a Thousand, he is apt to think, he, has a distinct _Idea_ of a
_Chiliaëdron_; though it be plain, he has no precise _Idea_ of its Figure, so as
to distinguish it, by that, from one that has but 999 sides: The not observing
wherereof, causes no small Error in Men's Thoughts, and confusion in their
Discourses.

{#14} He that thinks he has a distinct _Idea_ of the Figure of a _Chiliaëdron,_
let him for Trial's-sake take another parcel of the same uniform Matter, _viz._
Gold, or Wax, of an equal Bulk, and make it into a Figure of 999 sides. He will,
I doubt not, be able to distinguish these two _Ideas_ one from another by the
Number of sides; and reason, and argue distinctly about them, whilst he keeps
his Thoughts and Reasoning to that part only of these _Ideas,_ which is
contained in their Numbers; as that the sides of the one, could be divided into
two equal Numbers; and of the other, not, _&c._ But when he goes about to
distinguish them by their Figure, he will there be presently at a loss, and not
be able, I think, to frame in his Mind two _Ideas,_ one of them distinct from
the other, by the bare Figure of these two pieces of Gold; as he could, if the
same parcels of Gold were made one into a Cube, the other a Figure of five
sides. In which in compleat _Ideas,_ we are very apt to impose on our selves,
and wrangle with others, especially where they have particular and familiar
Names. For being satisfied in that part of the _Idea,_ which we have clear; and
the Name which is familiar to us, being applied to the whole, containing that
part also, which is imperfect and obscure, we are apt to use it for that
confused part, and draw deductions from it, in the obscure part of its
Signification, as confidently as we do from the other.

{#15} Having frequently in our Mouths the Name _Eternity,_ we are apt to think,
we have a positive comprehensive _Idea_ of it, which is as much as to say, that
there is no part of that Duration, which is not clearly contained in our _Idea._
'Tis true, that he that thinks so, may have a clear _Idea_ of Duration; he may
also have a very clear _Idea_ of a very great length of Duration; he may also
have a clear _Idea_ of the Comparison of that great one, with still a greater:
But it not being possible for him to include in his _Idea_ of any Duration, let
it be as great as it will, the whole Extent together of a Duration, where he
supposes no end, that part of his _Idea,_ which is still beyond the Bounds of
that large Duration, he represents to his own Thoughts, is very obscure and
undetermined. And hence it is, that in Disputes and Reasonings concerning
Eternity, or any other _Infinite,_ we are very apt to blunder, and involve our
selves in manifest Absurdities.

{#16} In Matter, we have no clear _Ideas_ of the smalness of Parts, much beyond
the smallest, that occurr to any of our Senses: and therefore when we talk of
the divisibility of Matter _in~infinitum,_ though we have clear _Ideas_ of
Division and Divisibility, and have also clear _Ideas_ of Parts, made out of a
whole, by Division; yet we have but very obscure, and confused _Ideas_ of
Corpuscles, or minute Bodies, so to be divided, when by former Divisions, they
are reduced to a smalness, much exceeding the perception of any of our Senses:
and so all that we have clear, and distinct _Ideas_ of, is of what Division in
general, or abstractly is, and the Relation of _Totum_ and _Pars_; But of the
bulk of the Body, to be thus infinitely divided after certain Progressions, I
think, we have no clear, nor distinct _Ideas_ at all. For I ask any one, Whether
taking the smallest Atom of Dust he ever saw, he has any distinct _Idea,_
(bating still the Number which concerns not Extension,) betwixt the 100,000, and
the 1000,000 part of it. Or if he think he can refine his _Ideas_ to that
Degree, without losing sight of them, let him add ten Cyphers to each of those
Numbers; for that will bring it no nearer the end of infinite Division, than the
first half does. I must confess for my part, I have no clear, distinct _Ideas_
of the different Bulk, or Extension of those Bodies, having but a very obscure
one of either of them. So that, I think, when we talk of Division of Bodies
_in~infinitum,_ our _Idea_ of their distinct Bulks or Extension, which is the
Subject and Foundation of Divisions, comes to be confounded, and almost lost in
Obscurity. For that _Idea,_ which is to represent only Bigness, must be very
obscure and confused, which we cannot distinguish from one ten times as big, but
only by Number: so that we have clear, distinct _Ideas,_ we may say of Ten and
One, but no distinct _Ideas_ of two such Extensions. 'Tis plain from hence, that
when we talk of infinite Divisibility of Body, or Extension, our distinct and
clear _Ideas_ are only of Numbers: but the clear, distinct _Ideas_ of Extension,
after some Progress of Division, is quite lost: and of such minute Parts, we
have no distinct _Ideas_ at all; but it returns, as all our _Ideas_ of Infinite
do, at last to that of Number always to be added; but thereby never amounts to
any distinct _Idea_ of actual, infinite Parts. We have, 'tis true, a clear
_Idea_ of Division, as often as we will think of it: but thereby we have no more
a clear _Idea_ of infinite Parts in Matter, then we have a clear _Idea_ of an
infinite Number, by being able still to add new Numbers to any assigned Number
we have: endless Divisibility giving us no more a clear and distinct _Idea_ of
actually infinite Parts, than endless Addibility (if I may so speak) gives us a
clear and distinct _Idea_ of an actually infinite Number: they both being only
in a Power still of increasing the Number, be it already as great as it will. So
that of what remains to be added, (wherein consists the Infinity,) we have but
an obscure, imperfect, and confused _Idea_; from or about which we can argue, or
reason with no Certainty or Clearness, no more than we can in Arithmetick, about
a Number of which we have no such distinct _Idea,_ as we have of 4 or 100; but
only this relative obscure one, that compared to any other, it is still bigger:
and we have no more a clear, positive _Idea_ of it, when we say or conceive it
is bigger, or more than 400, 000, 000, than if we should say, it is bigger than
40, or 4: 4000, 000, 000, having no nearer a proportion to the end of Addition,
or Number, than 4. For he that adds only 4 to 4, and so proceeds, shall as soon
come to the end of all Addition, as he that adds 400, 000, 000, to 400, 000,
000. And so likewise in Eternity, he that has an _Idea_ of but four years, has
as much a positive compleat _Idea_ of Eternity, as he that has one of 400, 000,
000 of Years: For what remains of Eternity beyond either of these two Numbers of
Years, is as clear to the one as the other; _i. e._ neither of them has any
clear positive _Idea_ of it at all. For he that adds only 4 Years to 4, and so
on, shall as soon reach Eternity, as he that adds 400, 000, 000 of Years, and so
on; or if he please, doubles the Increase as often as he will: The remaining
Abyss being still as far beyond the end of all these Progressions, as it is from
the length of a Day, or an Hour. For nothing finite, bears any proportion to
infinite; and therefore our _Ideas,_ which are all finite, cannot bear any. Thus
it is also in our _Idea_ of _Extension,_ when we increase it by Addition, as
well as when we diminish it by Division, and would enlarge our Thoughts to
infinite Space. After a few doublings of those _Ideas_ of Extension, which are
the largest we are accustomed to have, we lose the clear distinct _Idea_ of that
Space: it becomes a confusedly great one, with a Surplus of still greater; about
which, when we would argue, or reason, we shall always find our selves at a
loss; confused _Ideas_ in our Arguings, and Deductions from them, always leading
us into confusion.
