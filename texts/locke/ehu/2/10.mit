£2 _Of Retention._ £2

{#1} THE next Faculty of the Mind, whereby it makes a farther Progress towards
Knowledge, is that I call _Retention_; or the keeping of those simple _Ideas,_
which from Sensation or Reflection it hath received, which is done two ways;
First, either by keeping the _Idea,_ which is brought into it, for some time
actually in view, which is called _Contemplation._

{#2} The other, is the Power to revive again in our Minds those _Ideas_; which
after imprinting have disappeared, or have been as it were laid aside out of
Sight: And thus we do, when we conceive Heat or Light, Yellow or Sweet, the
Object being removed; and this is _Memory,_ which is as it were the Store-house
of our _Ideas._ For the narrow Mind of Man, not being capable of having many
_Ideas_ under View and Consideration at once, it was necessary to have a
Repository, to lay up those _Ideas_; which at another time it might have use of.
And thus it is, by the Assistance of the Memory, that we are said to have all
those _Ideas_ in our Understanding; which though we do not actually contemplate,
yet we can bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the Objects of our
Thoughts, without the help of those sensible Qualities, which first imprinted
them there.

{#3} _Attention_ and _Repetition help_ much to the fixing any _Ideas_ in _our
Memory_: But those, which naturally at first make the deepest, and most lasting
Impression, are those, which are accompanied with _Pleasure_ or _Pain._ The
great Business of the Senses, being to make us take notice of what hurts, or
advantages the Body, it is wisely ordered by Nature (as has been shewn) that
Pain should accompany the Reception of several _Ideas_; which supplying the
Place of Consideration and Reasoning in Children; and acting quicker than
Consideration in grown Men, makes both the Young and Old avoid painful Objects,
with that haste, which is necessary for their Preservation; and in both settles
in the Memory a caution for the Future.

{#4} But concerning the several _degrees of_ lasting, wherewith _Ideas_ are
imprinted on the _Memory,_ we may observe, First, That some of them being
produced in the Understanding, either by the Objects affecting the Senses once
barely, and no more, especially if the Mind then otherwise imployed, took but
little notice of it, and set not on the stamp deep into it self; or else, when
through the Temper of the Body, or otherwise, the Memory is very weak, such
_Ideas_ quickly fade, ad vanish quite out of the Understanding, and leave it as
clear without any Foot-steps, or remaining Characters, as Shadows do flying over
Fields of Corn; and the Mind is as void of them, as if they never had been
there.

{#5} Thus many of those _Ideas,_ which were produced in the Minds of Children,
in the beginning of their Sensation (some of which, perhaps, as of some
Pleasures and Pains were before they were born, and others in their Infancy) if
in the future Course of their Lives, they are not repeated again, are quite
lost, without the least glimpse remaining of them. This may be observed in
those, who by some Mischance have lost their sight, when they were very young;
in whom the _Ideas_ of Colours, having been but slightly taken notice of, and
ceasing to be repeated, do quite wear out; so that some years after, there is no
more Notion, nor Memory of Colours left in their Minds, than in those of People
born blind. The Memory in some Men, 'tis true, is very tenacious even, to a
Miracle: But yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our _Ideas,_ even
those which are struck deepest, and in the Minds the most retentive; so that if
they be not sometimes renewed by repeated Exercise of the Senses, or Reflection
about those kind of Objects, which at first occasioned them, the Print wears
out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen. Thus the _Ideas,_ as well as
Children of our Youth, often die before us: And our Minds represent to us those
Tombs, to which we are approaching; where though the Brass and Marble remain,
yet the Inscriptions are effaced by time, and the Imagery moulders away. _The
Pictures drawn in our Minds, are laid in fading Colours_; and if not sometimes
refreshed, vanish and disappear. How much the Constitution of our Bodies are
concerned in this; and whether the Temper of the Spirits and Brain make this
difference, that some retain the Characters drawn on it like Marble, others like
free Stone, and others little better than Sand, I shall not here enquire, though
it may seem probable, that the Constitution of the Body, does sometimes
influence the Memory; since we oftentimes find a Disease quite strip the Mind of
all its _Ideas,_ and the flames of a Fever in a few days, calcines all those
Images to dust and confusion, which seem'd to be as lasting, as if carved in
Marble.

{#6} But concerning the _Ideas_ themselves, it is easie to remark, That those
that are _oftenest refreshed_ (amongst which are those that are conveyed into
the Mind by more ways than one) by a frequent return of the Objects or Actions
that produce them, _fix themselves best in the Memory,_ and remain clearest and
longest there; and therefore those which are of the original Qualities of
Bodies, _viz. Solidity, Extension, Figure, Motion,_ and _Rest,_ and those that
almost constantly affect our Bodies, as _Heat_ and _Cold_; and those which are
the Affections of all kind of Beings, as _Existence, Duration,_ and _Number,_
which almost every Object that affects our Senses, every Thought which imploys
our Minds, bring along with them: These, I say, and the like _Ideas,_ are seldom
quite lost, whilst the Mind retains any _Ideas_ at all.

{#7} In this secundary Perception, as I may so call it, or viewing again the
_Ideas,_ that are lodg'd _in_ the _Memory, the Mind is oftentimes more than
barely passive,_ the appearance of those dormant Pictures, depending sometimes
on the Will. The Mind very often sets it self on work in search of some hidden
_Idea,_ and turns, as it were, the Eye of the Soul upon it; though sometimes too
they start up in our Minds of their own accord, and offer themselves to the
Understanding; and very often are rouzed and tumbled out of their dark Cells,
into open Day-light, by some turbulent and tempestuous Passion, our Affections
bringing _Ideas_ to our Memory, which had otherwise lain quiet and unregarded.

{#8} _Memory,_ in an intellectual Creature, is necessary in the next degree to
Perception. It is of so great moment, that where it is wanting, all the rest of
our Faculties are in a great measure useless: And we in our Thoughts,
Reasonings, and Knowledge, could not proceed beyond present Objects, were it not
for the assistance of our Memories, wherein there may be _two defects_: _First,_
That it _loses the Idea_ quite, and so far it produces perfect Ignorance. For
since we can know nothing farther, than we have the _Ideas_ of it, when they are
gone, we are in perfect _ignorance._ _Secondly,_ That it moves slowly, and
_retrieves not the Ideas,_ that it has, and are laid up in store, _quick enough_
to serve the Mind upon occasions. This, if it be to a great degree, is
_Stupidity_; and he, who through this default in his Memory, has not the
_Ideas,_ that are really preserved there, ready at hand, when need and occasion
calls for them, were almost as good be without them quite, since they serve him
to little purpose. The dull Man, who loses the opportunity, whilst he is seeking
in his Mind for those _Ideas,_ that should serve his turn, is not much more
happy in his Knowledge, than one that is perfectly ignorant. 'Tis the business
therefore of the Memory, to furnish to the Mind those dormant _Ideas,_ which it
has present occasion for, and in the having them ready at hand on all occasions
consists, that which we call _Invention, Fancy,_ and quickness of Parts.

{#9} This faculty of laying up, and retaining the _Ideas_ that are brought into
the Mind, several _other Animals_ seem to have, to a great degree, as well as
Man. For to pass by other instances, Birds learning of Tunes, and the endeavours
one may observe in them to hit the Notes right, put it past doubt with me, that
they have Perception, and retain _Ideas_ in their Memories, and use them for
Patterns. For it seems to me impossible, that they should endeavour to conform
their Voices to Notes (as 'tis plain they do) of which they had no _Ideas._ For
tho' I should grant Sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal
Spirits, in the Brains of those Birds, whilst the Tune is actually playing; and
that motion may be continued on to the Muscles of the Wings; and so the Bird
mechanically be driven away by certain noises, because this may tend to the
Birds preservation: yet that can never be supposed a Reason, why it should cause
mechanically, either whilst the Tune was playing, much less after it has ceased,
such a motion in the Organs of the Bird's voice, as should conform it to the
Notes of a foreign Sound, which imitation can be of no use to the Birds
preservation. But, which is more, it cannot with any appearance of Reason, be
suppos'd (much less proved) that Birds without Sense and Memory, can approach
their Notes nearer and nearer, by degrees, to a Tune play'd yesterday; which if
they have no _Idea_ of in their Memory, is now no-where, nor can be a Pattern
for them to imitate, or which any repeated Essays can bring them nearer to. Snce
there is no reason why the sound of a Pipe should leave traces in their Brains,
which not at first, but by their after-endeavours should produce the like
Sounds; and why the Sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which
they should follow, as well as those of the Pipe, is impossible to conceive.
