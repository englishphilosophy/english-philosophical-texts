£2 _Of _Ideas_ of one Sense._ £2

{#1} THE better to conceive the _Ideas,_ we receive from Sensation, it may not
be amiss for us to consider them, in reference to the different ways, whereby
they make their Approaches to our Minds, and make themselves perceivable by us.
_First_ then, There are some, which come into our Minds _by one Sense_ only.
_Secondly,_ There are others, that convey themselves into the Mind _by more
Senses than one._ _Thirdly,_ Others that are had from _Reflection_ only.
_Fourthly,_ There are some that make themselves way, and are suggested to the
Mind _by all the ways of Sensation and Reflection._ We shall consider them apart
under these several Heads: _First,_ There are _some_ Ideas, _which have
admittance only through one Sense,_ which is peculiarly adapted to receive them.
Thus Light and Colours, as white, red, yellow, blue; with their several Degrees
or Shades, and Mixtures, as Green, Scarlet, Purple, Sea-green, and the rest,
come in only by the Eyes: All kinds of Noises, Sounds, and Tones only by the
Ears: The several Tastes and Smells, by the Nose and Palate. And if these
Organs, or the Nerves which are the Conduits, to convey them from without to
their Audience in the Brain, the Mind's Presence-Room (as I may so call it) are
any of them so disordered, as not to perform their Functions, they have no
Postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be
perceived by the Understanding. The most considerable of those, belonging to the
Touch, are Heat and Cold, and Solidity; all the rest, consisting almost wholly
in the sensible Configuration, as smooth and rough; or else more, or less firm
adhesion of the Parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious enough.

{#2} I think, it will be needless to enumerate all the particular _simple
Ideas,_ belonging to each Sense: Nor indeed is it possible, if we would, there
being a great many _more_ of them belonging to most of the Senses, _than we have
Names for._ The variety of Smells, which are as many almost, if not more than
Species of Bodies in the World, do most of them want Names. _Sweet_ and
_Stinking_ commonly serve our turn for these _Ideas,_ which in effect, is little
more than to call them pleasing or displeasing; though the smell of a Rose, and
Violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct _Ideas._ Nor are the different
Tastes that are in Nature, much better provided with Names. Sweet, Bitter and
Sowre, Harsh and Salt, are almost all we have to denominate all the variety of
Relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of
Creatures, but in the different Parts of the same Plant or Animal. The same may
be said of Colour and Sound. I shall therefore in the account of simple _Ideas,_
I am here giving, content my self to set down only such, as are most material to
our present Purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though
they are very frequently the Ingredients of our complex _Ideas,_ amongst which,
I think, I may well account Solidity; which therefore I shall treat of in the
next Chapter.
