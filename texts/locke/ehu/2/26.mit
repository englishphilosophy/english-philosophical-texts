£2 _Of Cause and Effect, and other Relations._ £2

{#1} IN the notice, that our Senses take of the constant Vicissitude of Things,
we cannot but observe, that several particular, both Qualities, and Substances
begin to exist; and that they receive this their Existence, from the due
Application and Operation of some other Being. From this Observation, we get our
_Ideas_ of _Cause_ and _Effect._ That which produces any simple or complex
_Idea,_ we denote by the general Name _Cause_; and that which is produced,
_Effect._ Thus finding, that in that Substance which we call Wax, Fluidity,
which is a simple _Idea,_ that was not in it before, is constantly produced by
the Application of a certain degree of Heat, we call the simple _Idea_ of Heat,
in relation to Fluidity in Wax, the Cause of it; and Fluidity the Effect. So
also finding that the Substance, Wood, which is a certain Collection of simple
_Ideas,_ so called, will by the Application of Fire, be turned into another
Substance, called Ashes; _i. e._ another complex _Idea,_ consisting of a
Collection of simple _Ideas,_ quite different from that complex _Idea,_ which we
call Wood; we consider Fire, in relation to Ashes, as Cause, and the Ashes, as
Effect. So that whatever is considered by us, to conduce or operate, to the
producing any particular simple _Idea,_ or Collection of simple _Ideas,_ whether
Substance, or Mode, which did not before exist, hath thereby in our Minds the
relation of a Cause, and so is denominated by us.

{#2} Having thus, from what our Senses are able to discover, in the Operations
of Bodies on one another, got the Notion of Cause and Effect; _viz._ That a
Cause is that which makes any other thing, either simple _Idea,_ Substance, or
Mode, begin to be; and an Effect is that, which had its Beginning from some
other thing, The Mind finds no great difficulty, to distinguish the several
Originals of things into two sorts: _First,_ When the thing is wholly made new,
so that no part thereof did ever exist before; as when a new Particle of Matter
doth begin to exist, _in rerum natura,_ which had before no Being; and this we
call _Creation._ _Secondly,_ When a thing is made up of Particles, which did all
of them before exist, but that very thing, so constituted of pre-existing
Particles, which considered altogether make up such a Collection of simple
_Ideas,_ had not any _Existence_ before, as this Man, this Egg, Rose, or Cherry,
_&c._ And this, when referred to a Substance, produced in the ordinary course of
Nature, by an internal Principle, but set on work by, and received from some
external Agent, or Cause, and working by insensible ways, which we perceive not,
we call _Generation_; when the Cause is extrinsical, and the Effect produced by
a sensible Separation, or _juxta_ Position of discernable Parts, we call it
_Making_; and such are all artificial things. When any simple _Idea_ is
produced, which was not in that Subject before, we call it _Alteration._ Thus a
Man is generated, a Picture made, and either of them altered, when any new
sensible Quality, or simple _Idea,_ is produced in either of them, which was not
there before; and the things thus made to exist, which were not there before,
are _Effects_; and those things, which operated to the Existence, _Causes._ In
which, and all other Cases, we may observe, that the Notion of Cause and Effect,
has its rise from _Ideas,_ received by Sensation or Reflection; and that this
Relation, how comprehensive soever, terminates at last in them. For to have the
_Idea_ of Cause and Effect, it suffices to consider any simple _Idea,_ or
Substance, as beginning to exist, by the Operation of some other, without
knowing the manner of that Operation.

{#3} _Time_ and _Place,_ are also the Foundations of very large Relations, and
all finite Beings, at least are concerned in them. But having already shewn in
another Place, how we got these _Ideas,_ it may suffice here to intimate, that
most of the Denominations of things, received from time, are only Relations;
thus, when any one says, that Queen _Elizabeth_ lived sixty nine, and reigned
forty five years; these Words import only the Relation of that Duration to some
other, and means no more but this, that the Duration of her Existence was equal
to sixty nine, and the Duration of her Government to forty five Annual
Revolutions of the Sun; and so are all Words, answering, _how long._ Again,
_William_ the Conqueror invaded _England_ about the year 1070. which means this;
that taking the Duration from our Saviour's Time, till now, for one entire great
length of time, it shews at what distance this Invasion was from the two
Extremes: and so do all Words of time, answering to the Question _when,_ which
shew only the distance of any point of time, from the Period of a longer
Duration, from which we measure, and to which we thereby consider it, as
related.

{#4} \S. 4 There are yet besides those, other Words of time, that ordinarily are
thought to stand for positive _Ideas,_ which yet will, when considered, be found
to be relative, such as are _Young, Old,_ &c. which include, and intimate the
Relation any things has, to a certain length of Duration, whereof we have the
_Idea_ in our Minds. Thus having setled in our Thoughts the _Idea_ of the
ordinary Duration of a Man to be seventy years, when we say a Man is _Young,_ we
mean, that his Age is yet but a small part of that which usually Men attain to:
And when we denominate him _Old,_ we mean, that his Duration is run out almost
to the end of that which Men do not usually exceed. And so 'tis but comparing
the particular Age, or Duration of this or that Man, to the _Idea_ of that
Duration which we have in our Minds, as ordinarily belonging to that sort of
Animals: Which is plain, in the application of these Names to other Things; for
a Man is called young at twenty years, and very young at seven years old: But
yet a Horse we call old at twenty, and a Dog at seven years; because in each of
these, we compare their Age to different _Ideas_ of Duration which are setled in
our Minds, as belonging to these several sorts of Animals, in the ordinary
course of Nature. But the Sun, and Stars, though they have outlasted several
Generations of Men, we call not old, because we do not know what period GOD hath
set to that sort of Beings. This Term belonging properly to those Things, which
we can observe in the ordinary course of Things, by a natural decay to come to
an end, in a certain period of time; and so have in our Minds, as it were, a
Standard, to which we can compare the several parts of their Duration; and by
the relation they bear thereunto, call them young, or old; which we cannot
therefore do to a Ruby, or a Diamond, things whose usual periods we know not.

{#5} The _Relation_ also that things have to one another, in their _Places_ and
Distances, is very obvious to observe; as Above, Below, a Mile distant from
_Charing-Cross,_ in _England,_ and in _London._ But as in Duration, so in
_Extension_ and Bulk, there are some _Ideas_ that are relative, which we
signifie by Names, that are thought positive; as _Great, and Little, are_ truly
_Relations._ For here also having, by observation, setled in our Minds the
_Ideas_ of the Bigness of several Species of Things, from those we have been
most accustomed to, we make them, as it were, the Standards whereby to
denominate the Bulk of others. Thus we call a great Apple, such an one as is
bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have been used to; and a little Horse,
such an one as comes not up to the size of that _Idea,_ which we have in our
Minds, to belong ordinarily to Horses: And that will be a great Horse to a
_Welsh_-man, which is but a little one to a _Fleming_; they two having from the
different Breed of their Countries, taken several siz'd _Ideas_ to which they
compare, and in relation to which they denominate their Great, and their Little.

{#6} So likewise _Weak and Strong, are_ but _relative Denominations_ of Power,
compared to some _Idea_ we have, at that time, of greater or less Power. Thus
when we say a Weak Man, we mean one that has not so much Strength, or Power to
move, as usually Men have, or usually those of his size have; which is a
comparing his Strength, to the _Idea_ we have of the usual Strength of Men, or
Men of such a size. The like when we say the Creatures are all weak Things;
Weak, there, is but a relative term, signifying the disproportion there is in
the Power of GOD, and the Creatures. And so abundance of Words, in ordinary
Speech, stand only for Relations, (and, perhaps, the greatest part,) which at
first sight, seem to have no such signification: _v. g._ The Ship has necessary
Stores: _Necessary,_ and _Stores,_ are both relative Words; one having a
relation to the accomplishing the thing intended, and the other to future use.
All which Relations, how they are confined to, and terminate in _Ideas_ derived
from _Sensation,_ or _Reflection,_ is too obvious to need any Explication.
