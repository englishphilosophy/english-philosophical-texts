£2 _Of Adequate and Inadequate Ideas._ £2

{#1} OF our real _Ideas,_ some are Adequate, and some are Inadequate. Those I
call _Adequate,_ which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the Mind
supposes them taken from; which it intends them to stand for; and to which it
refers them. _Inadequate Ideas_ are such, which are but a partial, or incompleat
representation of those Archetypes to which they are referred. Upon which
account it is plain,

{#2} _First,_ That _all our simple Ideas are adequate._ Because being nothing
but the effects of certain Powers in Things, fitted and ordained by GOD, to
produce such Sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent, and adequate to
those Powers: And we are sure they agree to the reality of Things. For if Sugar
produce in us the _Ideas_ which we call Whiteness, and Sweetness, we are sure
there is a power in Sugar to produce those _Ideas_ in our Minds, or else they
could not have been produced. And so each Sensation answering the Power that
operates on any of our Senses, the _Idea_ so produced, is a real _Idea,_ (and
not a fiction of the Mind,) which has no power to produce any simple _Idea_; and
cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all
simple _Ideas_ are adequate. 'Tis true, the Things producing in us these simple
_Ideas,_ are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the causes
of them; but as if those _Ideas_ were real Beings in them. For though Fire be
call'd painful to the Touch, whereby it signified the power of producing in us
the _Idea_ of Pain: yet it is denominated also Light, and Hot; as if Light, and
Heat, were really something in the Fire, more than a power to excite these
_Ideas_ in us; and therefore are called Qualities: in, or of the Fire. But these
being nothing, in truth, but powers to excite such _Ideas_ in us, I must, in
that sense, be understood, when I speak of secundary Qualities, as being in
Things; or of their _Ideas,_ as being in the Objects, that excite them in us.
Such ways of speaking, though accommodated to the vulgar Notions, without which,
one cannot be well understood; yet truly signifie nothing, but those Powers,
which are in Things, to excite certain Sensations or _Ideas_ in us. Since were
there no fit Organs to receive the impressions Fire makes on the Sight and
Touch; nor a Mind joined to those Organs, to receive the _Ideas_ of Light and
Heat, by those impressions from the Fire, or the Sun, there would yet be no more
Light, or Heat in the World, than there would be Pain, if there were no sensible
Creature to feel it, though the Sun should continue just as it is now, and Mount
_AEtna_ flame higher than ever it did. Solidity, and Extension, and the
termination of it, Figure, with Motion and Rest, whereof we have the _Ideas,_
would be really in the World as they are, whether there were any sensible Being
to perceive them, or no: And therefore those we have reason to look on, as the
real modifications of Matter; and such as are the exciting Causes of all our
various Sensations from Bodies. But this being an Enquiry not belonging to this
place, I shall enter no farther into it, but proceed to shew what complex
_Ideas_ are adequate, and what not.

{#3} _Secondly,_ Our _complex Ideas of Modes,_ being voluntary Collections of
simple _Ideas,_ which the Mind puts together, without reference to any real
Archetypes, or standing Patterns, existing any where, _are,_ and cannot but be
_adequate Ideas._ Because they not being intended for Copies of Things really
existing, but for Archetypes made by the Mind, to rank and denominate Things by,
cannot want any thing; they having each of them that combination of _Ideas,_ and
thereby that perfection the Mind intended they should: So that the Mind
acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus by having the _Idea_ of a
Figure, with three sides, meeting at three Angles, I have a compleat _Idea,_
wherein I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the Mind is satisfied
with the perfection of this its _Idea,_ is plain, in that it doe; not conceive,
that any Understanding hath, or can have a more compleat or perfect _Idea_ of
that thing it signifies by the word Triangle, supposing it to exist, than it
self has in that complex _Idea_ of three Sides, and three Angles: in which is
contained all that is, or can be essential to it, or necessary to compleat it,
where-ever or howe-ever it exists. But in our _Ideas_ of Substances, it is
otherwise. For there desiring to copy Things, as they really do exist; and to
represent to our selves that Constitution, on which all their Properties depend,
we perceive our _Ideas_ attain not that Perfection we intend: We find they still
want something we should be glad were in them; and so are all inadequate. But
mixed Modes and Relations, being Archetypes without Patterns, and so having
nothing to represent but themselves, cannot but be adequate, every thing being
so to it self. He that as first put together the _Idea_ of Danger perceived,
absence of disorder from Fear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be
done, and executing of that without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger
of it, had certainly in his Mind that complex _Idea_ made up of that
Combination: and intending it to be nothing else, but what it is; nor to have in
it any other simple _Ideas,_ but what it hath, it could not also but be an
adequate _Idea_: and laying this up in his Memory, with the name _Courage_
annexed to it, to signifie it to others, and denominate from thence any Action
he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a Standard to measure and
denominate Actions by, as they agreed to it. This _Idea_ thus made, and laid up
for a Pattern, must necessarily be adequate, being referred to nothing else but
it self, nor made by any other Original, but the Good-liking and Will of him,
that first made this Combination.

{#4} Indeed, another coming after, and in Conversation learning from him the
word _Courage,_ may make an _Idea,_ to which he gives that name _Courage,_
different from what the first Author applied it to, and has in his Mind, when he
uses it. And in this case, if he designs, that his _Idea_ in Thinking, should be
conformable to the other's _Idea,_ as the Name he uses in speaking, is
conformable in sound to his, from whom he learned it, his _Idea_ may be very
wrong, and inadequate. Because in this case, making the other Man's _Idea_ the
pattern of his _Idea_ in thinking, as the other Man's Word, or Sound, is the
pattern of his in speaking, his _Idea_ is so far defective and inadequate, as it
is distant from the Archetype and Pattern he refers it to, and intends to
express and signifie by the name he uses for it: which name he would have to be
a sign of the other Man's _Idea,_ (to which, in its proper use, it is primarily
annexed,) and of his own, as agreeing to it: to which if his own does not
exactly correspond, it is faulty and inadequate.

{#5} Therefore these _complex Ideas of Modes,_ when they are referred by the
Mind, and intended to correspond to the _Ideas_ in the Mind of some other
intelligent Being, expressed by the Names, we apply to them, they _may be_ very
deficient, wrong, and _inadequate._ Because they agree not to that, which the
Mind designs to be their Archetype, and Pattern: In which respect only, any
_Idea_ of Modes can be wrong, imperfect, or inadequate. And on this account, our
_Ideas_ of mixed Modes are the most liable to be faulty of any other: but this
refers more to proper Speaking than Knowing right.

{#6} _Thirdly,_ What _Ideas we have of Substances,_ I have above shewed: Now
those _Ideas_ have in the Mind a double reference: 1. Sometimes they are
referred to a supposed real Essence of each Species of Things. 2. Sometimes they
are only design'd to be Pictures and Representations in the Mind, of Things that
do exist, by _Ideas_ that are discoverable in them. In both which ways, these
Copies of their Originals, and Archetypes, _are_ imperfect and _inadequate._
_First,_ It is usual for Men to make the Names of Substances, stand for Things,
as supposed to have certain real Essences, whereby they are of this or that
Species: And Names standing for nothing but the _Ideas,_ that are in Men's
Minds, they must consequently refer their _Ideas_ to such real Essences, as to
their Archetypes. That Men (especially such as have been bred up in the Learning
taught in this part of the World) do suppose certain specifick Essences of
Substances, which each Individual in its several kind is made conformable to,
and partakes of, is so far from needing proof, that it will be thought strange
if any one should do otherwise. And thus they ordinarily apply the specifick
Names, they rank particular Substances under, to Things, as distinguished by
such specifick real Essences. Who is there almost, who would not take it amiss,
if it should be doubted, whether he call'd himself Man, with any other meaning
than as having the real Essence of a Man? And yet if you demand, what those real
Essences are, 'tis plain Men are ignorant, and know them not. From whence it
follows, that the _Ideas_ they have in their Minds, being referred to real
Essences as Archetypes which are unknown, must be so far from being adequate,
that they cannot be supposed to be any representation of them at all. The
complex _Ideas_ we have of Substances, are, as has been shewed, certain
Collections of simple _Ideas,_ that have been observed or supposed constantly to
exist together. But such a complex _Idea_ cannot be the real Essence of any
Substance: for then the Properties we discover in that Body, would depend on
that complex _Idea,_ and be deducible from it, and their necessary connexion
with it be known; as all Properties of a Triangle depend on, and, as far as they
are discoverable, are deducible from the complex _Idea_ of three Lines,
including a Space. But it is plain, that in our complex _Ideas_ of Substances,
are not contained such _Ideas,_ on which all the other Qualities, that are to be
found in them, do depend. The common _Idea_ Men have of Iron, is a Body of a
certain Colour, Weight, and Hardness; and a Property that they look on as
belonging to it, is malleableness. But yet this Property has no necessary
connexion with that complex _Idea,_ nor any part of it: and there is no more
reason to think, that malleableness depends on that Colour, Weight, and
Hardness, than that that Colour, or that Weight, depends on its malleableness.
And yet, though we know nothing of these real Essences, there is nothing more
ordinary, than that Men should attribute the sorts of Things to such Essences.
The particular parcel of Matter which makes the Ring I have on my Finger, is
forwardly, by most Men, supposed to have a real Essence, whereby it is Gold; and
from whence those Qualities flow, which I find in it, _viz._ its peculiar,
Colour, Weight, Hardness, Fusibility, Fixedness, and change of Colour upon a
slight touch of Mercury, _&c._ This Essence, from which all these Properties
flow, when I enquire into it, and search after it, I plainly perceive I cannot
discover: the farthest I can go, is only to presume, that it being nothing but
Body, its real Essence, or internal Constitution, on which these Qualities
depend, can be nothing but the Figure, Size, and Connexion of its solid Parts;
of neither of which, I having any distinct perception at all, I can have no
_Idea_ of its real Essence, which is the cause that it has that particular
shining yellowness; a greater weight than any thing I know of the same bulk; and
a fitness to have its Colour changed by the touch of Quicksilver. If any one
will say, that the real Essence, and internal Constitution, on which these
Properties depend, is not the Figure, Size, and Arangement or Connexion of its
solid Parts, but something else, call'd its particular form; I am farther from
having any _Idea_ of its real Essence, than I was before. For I have an _Idea_
of Figure, Size, and Situation of solid Parts in general, though I have none of
the particular Figure, Size, or putting together of Parts, whereby the Qualities
above-mentioned are produced; which Qualities I find in that particular parcel
of Matter that is on my Finger, and not in another parcel of Matter with which I
cut the Pen I write with. But when I am told, that something besides the Figure,
Size, and Posture of the solid Parts of that Body, is its Essence, something
called substantial form, of that, I confess, I have no _Idea_ at all, but only
of the sound _Form_: which is far enough from an _Idea_ of its real Essence, or
Constitution. The like ignorance as I have of the real Essence of this
particular Substance, I have also of the real Essence of all other natural ones:
Of which Essences, I confess, I have no distinct _Ideas_ at all; and I am apt to
suppose, others, when they examine their own Knowledge, will find in themselves,
in this one point, the same sort of ignorance.

{#7} Now then, when Men apply to this particular parcel of Matter on my Finger,
a general Name already in use, and denominate it _Gold,_ Do they not ordinarily,
or are they not understood to give it that Name, as belonging to a particular
Species of Bodies, having a real internal Essence; by having of which Essence,
this particular Substance comes to be of that Species, and to be called by that
Name? If it be so, as it is plain it is, the name by which Things are marked, as
having that Essence, must be referred primarily to that Essence; and
consequently the _Idea_ to which that name is given, must be referred also to
that Essence, and be intended to represent it: which Essence, since they who so
use the Names, know not their _Ideas of Substances_ must be _all inadequate_ in
that respect, as not containing in them that real Essence, which the Mind
intends they should.

{#8} _Secondly,_ Those who, neglecting that useless Supposition of unknown real
Essences, whereby they are distinguished, endeavour to copy the Substances, that
exist in the World, by putting together the _Ideas_ of those sensible Qualities,
which are sound co-existing in them, though they come much nearer a likeness of
them, than those who imagine they know not what real specifick Essences: yet
they arrive not at perfectly adequate _Ideas_ of those Substances, they would
thus copy into their Minds: nor do those Copies, exactly and fully, contain all
that is to be found in their Archetypes. Because those Qualities, and Powers, of
Substances, whereof we make their complex _Ideas,_ are so many and various, that
no Man's complex _Idea_ contains them all. That our abstract _Ideas_ of
Substances, do not contain in them all the simple _Ideas_ that are united in the
Things themselves, is evident, in that Men do rarely put into their complex
_Idea_ of any Substance, all the simple _Ideas_ they do know to exist in it.
Because endeavouring to make the signification of their specifick Names, as
clear, and as little cumbersome as they can, they make their specifick _Ideas_
of the sorts of Substances, for the most part, of a few of those simple _Ideas_
which are to be found in them: But these having no original precedency, or right
to be put in, and make the specifick _Idea,_ more than others that are left out,
'tis plain that both these ways, _our Ideas of Substances_ are deficient, and
_inadequate._ The simple _Ideas_ whereof we make our complex ones of Substances,
are all of them (baring only the Figure and Bulk of some sorts) Powers; which
being Relations to other Substances, we can never be sure we know all the Powers
that are in any one Body, till we have tried what Changes it is fitted to give
to, or receive from other Substances, in their several ways of application:
which being impossible to be tried upon any one Body, much less upon all, it is
impossible we should have adequate _Ideas_ of any Substance, made up of a
Collection of all its Properties.

{#9} Whosoever first light on a parcel of that sort of Substance, we denote by
the word _Gold,_ could not rationally take the Bulk and Figure he observed in
that lump, to depend on its real Essence; on its internal Constitution.
Therefore those never went into his _Idea_ of that Species of Body: but its
peculiar Colour, perhaps, and Weight, were the first he abstracted from it, to
make the complex _Idea_ of that Species. Which both are but Powers; the one to
affect our Eyes, after such a manner, and to produce in us that _Idea_ we call
Yellow; and the other to force upwards any other Body of equal bulk, they being
put into a pair of equal Scales, one against another. Another, perhaps, added to
these, the _Ideas_ of Fusibility and Fixedness, two other passive Powers, in
relation to the operation of Fire upon it: Another, its Ductility and Solubility
in _Aq. Regia,_ two other Powers, relating to the operation of other Bodies, in
changing its outward Figure, or Separation of it, into sensible Parts. These, or
part of these, put together, usually make the complex _Idea_ in Mens Minds, of
that sort of Body we call Gold.

{#10} But no one, who hath considered the Properties of Bodies in general, or
this sort in particular, can doubt that this, call'd _Gold,_ has infinite other
Properties, not contained in that complex _Idea_: Some, who have examined this
Species more accurately, could, I believe, enumerate ten times as many
Properties in Gold; all of them as inseparable from its internal Constitution,
as its Colour, or Weight: And 'tis probable, if any one knew all the Properties,
that are by divers Men known of this Metal, there would an hundred times as many
_Ideas,_ go to the complex _Idea_ of Gold, as any one Man yet has in his; and
yet that not, perhaps, be the thousandth part of what is to be discovered in it.
The changes that that one Body is apt to receive, and make in other Bodies, upon
a due application, exceeding far, not only what we know, but what we are apt to
imagine. Which will not appear so much a Paradox to any one, who will but
consider, how far Men are yet from knowing all the Properties of that one, no
very compound Figure, a Triangle, though it be no small numbers that are already
by Mathematicians discovered of it.

{#11} So that _all our complex Ideas of Substances are_ imperfect and
_inadequate_: which would be so also in mathematical Figures, if we were to have
our complex _Ideas_ of them, only by collecting their Properties, in reference
to other Figures. How uncertain, and imperfect, would our _Ideas_ be of an
_Elypsis,_ if we had no other _Idea_ of it, but some few of its Properties?
Whereas having in our plain _Idea,_ the whole Essence of that Figure, we from
thence discover those Properties, and demonstratively see how they flow, and are
inseparable from it.

{#12} Thus the Mind has three sorts of abstract _Ideas,_ or nominal Essences:
_First, Simple Ideas,_ which _are_$[greek text]$, or _Copies_; but yet certainly
adequate. Because being intended to express nothing but the power in Things to
produce in the Mind such a Sensation, that Sensation, when it is produced,
cannot but be the Effect of that Power. So the Paper I write on, having the
power, in the Light, (I speak according to the common Notion of Light,) to
produce in me the Sensation, which I call White, it cannot but be the Effect of
such a Power, in something without the Mind; since the Mind has not the power to
produce any such _Idea_ in its self, and being meant for nothing else but the
Effect of such a Power, that simple _Idea_ is real and _adequate_: the sensation
of White, in my Mind, being the Effect of that Power, which is in the Paper to
produce it, is perfectly adequate to that Power; or else, that Power would
produce a different _Idea._

{#13} _Secondly,_ The _complex Ideas of Substances are Ectypes, Copies_ too; but
not perfect ones, not adequate: which is very evident to the Mind, in that it
plainly perceives, that whatever Collection of simple _Ideas_ it makes of any
Substance that exists, it cannot be sure, that it exactly answers all that are
in that Substance. Since not having tried all the Operations of all other
Substances upon it, and found all the Alterations it would receive from, or
cause in other Substances, it cannot have an exact adequate Collection of all
its active and passive Capacities; and so _not_ have an _adequate_ complex
_Idea_ of the Powers of any Substance existing, and its Relations, which is that
sort of complex _Idea_ of Substances we have. And, after all, if we could have,
and actually had, in our complex _Idea,_ an exact Collection of all the
secundary Qualities, or Powers of any Substance, we should not yet thereby have
an _Idea_ of the Essence of that Thing. For since the Powers, or Qualities, that
are observable by us, are not the real Essence of that Substance, but depend on
it, and flow from it, any Collection whatsoever of these Qualities, cannot be
the real Essence of that Thing. Whereby it is plain, that our _Ideas_ of
Substances are not adequate; are not what the Mind intends them to be. Besides,
a Man has no _Idea_ of Substance in general, nor knows what Substance is in it
self.

{#14} _Thirdly, Complex Ideas of Modes and Relations, are_ Originals, and
_Archetypes_; are not Copies, nor made after the pattern of any real Existence,
to which the Mind intends them to be conformable, and exactly to answer. These
being such Collections of simple _Ideas,_ that the Mind it self puts together,
and such Collections, that each of them contains in it precisely all that the
Mind intends it should, they are Archetypes and Essences of Modes that may
exist: and so are designed only for, and belong only to such Modes, as when they
do exist, have an exact conformity with those complex _Ideas._ The _Ideas_
therefore of Modes and Relations, cannot but be _adequate._
