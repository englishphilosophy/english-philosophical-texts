£2 _Of Collective Ideas of Substances._ £2

{#1} BEsides these complex _Ideas_ of several single Substances, as of Man,
Horse, Gold, Violet, Apple, _&c._ the Mind hath also _complex collective Ideas_
of Substances; which I so call, because such _Ideas_ are made up of many
particular Substances considered together, as united into one _Idea,_ and which
so joined, are looked on as one; _v. g._ the _Idea_ of such a collection of Men
as make an Army, though consisting of a great number of distinct Substances, is
as much one _Idea,_ as the _Idea_ of a Man: And the great collective _Idea_ of
all Bodies whatsoever signified by the name World, is as much one _Idea,_ as the
_Idea_ of any the least Particle of Matter in it; it sufficing, to the unity of
any _Idea,_ that it be considered as one Representation, or Picture, though made
up of never so many Particulars.

{#2} These collective _Ideas_ of Substances, the Mind makes by its power of
Composition, and uniting severally either simple or complex _Ideas_ into one, as
it does, by the same Faculty, make the complex _Ideas_ of particular Substances,
consisting of an aggregate of divers simple _Ideas,_ united in one Substance:
And as the Mind by putting together the repeated _Ideas_ of Unity, makes the
collective Mode, or complex _Idea_ of any number, as a Score, or a Gross, _&c._
So by putting together several particular Substances, it makes collective
_Ideas_ of Substances, as a Troop, an Army, a Swarm, a City, a Fleet; each of
which, every one finds, that he represents to his own Mind, by one _Idea,_ in
one view; and so under that Notion, considers the Things themselves as perfectly
one, as one Ship, or one Atom. Nor is it harder to conceive, how an Army of ten
Thousand Men, should make one _Idea,_ than how a Man should make one _Idea_; it
being as easie to the Mind, to unite into one, the _Idea_ of a great number of
Men, and consider it as one; as it is to unite into one particular, all the
distinct _Ideas,_ that make up the composition of a Man, and consider them
altogether as one

{#3} Amongst such kind of collective _Ideas,_ are to be counted most part of
artificial Things, at least such of them as are made up of distinct Substances:
And, in truth, if we consider all these collective _Ideas_ aright, as _ARMY,
Constellation, Universe,_ as they are united into so many single _Ideas,_ they
are but the artificial Draughts of the Mind, bringing things very remote, and
independent one from another, into one view, the better to contemplate, and
discourse of them, united into one conception, and signified by one name. For
there are no Things so remote, nor so contrary, which the Mind cannot, by this
art of Composition, bring into one _Idea,_ as is visible in that signified by
the name _Universe._
