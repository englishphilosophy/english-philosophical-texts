£2 _Some farther Considerations concerning our Knowledge._ £2

{#1} _OUr Knowledge,_ as in other Things, so in this, has a great Conformity
with our Sight, that it is _neither wholly necessary, nor wholly voluntary._ If
our Knowledge were altogether necessary, all Men's Knowledge would not only be
alike, but every Man would know all that is knowable; and if it were wholly
voluntary, some Men so little regard or value it, that they would have extreme
little, or none at all. Men that have Senses, cannot chuse but receive some
_Ideas_ by them; and if they have Memory, they cannot but retain some of them;
and if they have any distinguishing Faculty, cannot but perceive the Agreement,
or Disagreement of some of them one with another: As he that has Eyes, if he
will open them by day, cannot but see some Objects, and perceive a difference in
them. But though a Man with his Eyes open in the Light, cannot but see: yet
there be certain Objects, which he may chuse whether he will turn his Eyes to;
there may be in his reach a Book containing Pictures, and Discourses, capable to
delight, or instruct him, which yet he may never have the Will to open, never
take the Pains to look into.

{#2} There is also another thing in a Man's Power, and that is, though he turn
his Eyes sometimes towards an Object, yet he may chuse whether he will intently
survey it, and with an accurate search, endeavour to observe all that is visible
in it. But yet what he does see, he cannot see otherwise than he does: It
depends not on his Will to see that Black, which appears Yellow; nor to persuade
himself, that what actually scalds him, feels cold: The Earth will not appear
painted with Flowers, nor the Fields covered with Verdure, whenever he has a
Mind to it; in the cold Winter, he cannot help seeing it white and hoary, if he
will look abroad. Just thus is it with our Understanding, all that is _voluntary
in_ our Knowledge, is the _employing,_ or with-holding any of _our Faculties_
from this or that sort of Objects, and a more, or less accurate survey of them:
But they being employed, _our Will hath no Power to determine the Knowledge of
the Mind_ one way or other; that is done only by the Objects themselves, as far
as they are clearly discovered. And therefore, as far as Men's Senses are
conversant about external Objects, the Mind cannot but receive those _Ideas,_
which are presented by them, and be informed of the Existence of Things without:
and so far as Men's Thoughts converse with their own clear and distinct _Ideas,_
they cannot but, in some measure, observe the Agreement, and Disagreement that
is to be found amongst some of them, which is so far Knowledge: and if they have
Names for those _Ideas,_ they have thus considered, they must needs be assured
of the Truth of those Propositions, which express that Agreement, or
Disagreement they perceive in them, and be undoubtedly convinced of those
Truths. For what a Man sees, he cannot but see; and what he perceives, he cannot
but know that he perceives.

{#3} Thus he that has got the _Ideas_ of Numbers, and hath taken the Pains to
compare _One, Two,_ and _Three,_ to _Six,_ cannot chuse but know that they are
equal: He that hath got the _Idea_ of a Triangle, and found the ways to measure
its Angles, and their Magnitudes, is as certain that its three Angles are equal
to two right ones, as that it is impossible for the same to be, and not to be.
He also that hath the _Idea_ of an intelligent, but frail and weak Being, made
by and depending on another, who is eternal, omnipotent, perfectly wise and
good, will as certainly know that Man is to honour, fear, and obey God, as that
the Sun shines when he sees it. For if he hath but the _Ideas_ of two such
Beings in his Mind, and will turn his Thoughts that way, and consider them, he
will as certainly find that the Inferior, Finite, and Dependent, is under an
Obligation to obey the Supreme and Infinite, as he is certain to find, that
_Three, Five,_ and _Seven,_ are less than _Fifteen,_ if he will consider, and
compute those Numbers; nor can he be surer in a clear Morning that the Sun is
risen, if he will but open his Eyes, and turn them that way. But yet these
Truths, being never so certain, never so clear, he may be ignorant of either, or
all of them, who will never take the Pains to employ his Faculties, as he
should, to inform himself about them.
