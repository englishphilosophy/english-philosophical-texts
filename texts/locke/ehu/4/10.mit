£2 _Of our Knowledge of the Existence of a GOD._ £2

{#1} THough God has given us no innate _Ideas_ of himself; though he has stamped
no original Characters in our Minds, wherein we may read his Being: yet having
furnished us with those Faculties, our Minds are endowed with, he hath not left
himself without witness: since we have Sense, Perception, and Reason, and cannot
want a clear proof of him, as long as we carry our selves about us. Nor can we
justly complain of our Ignorance in this great Point, since he has so
plentifully provided us with the means to discover, and know him, so far as is
necessary to the end of our Being, and the great concernment of our Happiness.
But though this be the most obvious Truth that Reason discovers; and though its
Evidence be (if I mistake not) equal to mathematical Certainty: yet it requires
Thought and Attention; and the Mind must apply its self to a regular deduction
of it from some unquestionable parts of our Knowledge, or else we shall be as
uncertain, and ignorant of this, as of other Propositions, which are in
themselves capable of clear Demonstration. To shew therefore, that _we are
capable of knowing, certainly_ knowing _that there is a God,_ and how we come by
it, I think we need look no farther than our selves, and that undoubted
Knowledge we have of our own Existence.

{#2} I think it is beyond Question, that _Man has a clear Perception of his own
Being_; he knows certainly, that he exists, and that he is something. He that
can doubt, whether he be any thing, or no, I speak not to, no more than I would
argue with pure nothing; or endeavour to convince Non-entity, that it were
something. If any one pretend to be so sceptical, as to deny his own Existence,
(for really to doubt of it, is manifestly impossible,) let him for me enjoy his
beloved Happiness of being nothing, until Hunger, or some other Pain convince
him of the contrary. This then, I think, I may take for a Truth, which every
ones certain Knowledge assures him of, beyond the liberty of doubting, _viz._
that he is something that actually exists.

{#3} In the next place, Man knows by an intuitive Certainty, that bare _nothing
can no more produce any real Being, than it can be equal to two right Angles._
If a Man knows not that Non-entity, or the Absence of all Being cannot be equal
to two right Angles, it is impossible he should know any demonstration in
_Euclid._ If therefore we know there is some real Being, and that Non-entity
cannot produce any real Being, it is an evident demonstration, that from
Eternity there has been something. Since what was not from Eternity, had a
Beginning; and what had a Beginning, must be produced by something else.

{#4} Next, it is evident, that what had its Being and Beginning from another,
must also have all that which is in, and belongs to its Being from another too.
All the Powers it has, must be owing to, and received from the same Source. This
eternal Source then of all being must also be the Source and Original of all
Power; and so _this eternal Being must be also the most powerful._

{#5} Again, a Man finds in himself Perception, and Knowledge. We have then got
one step farther; and we are certain now, that there is not only some Being, but
some knowing intelligent Being in the World. There was a time then, when there
was no knowing Being, and when Knowledge began to be; or else, there has been
also _a knowing Being from Eternity._ If it be said, there was a time when no
Being had any Knowledge, when that eternal Being was void of all Understanding.
I reply, that then it was impossible there should ever have been any Knowledge.
It being as impossible, that Things wholly void of Knowledge, and operating
blindly, and without any Perception, should produce a knowing Being, as it is
impossile, that a Triangle should make it self three Angles bigger than two
right ones. For it is as repugnant to the _Idea_ of sensless Matter, that it
should put into it self Sense, Perception, and Knowledge, as it is repugnant to
the _Idea_ of a Triangle, that it should put into it self greater Angles than
two right ones.

{#6} Thus from the Consideration of our selves, and what we infallibly find in
our own Constitutions, our Reason leads us to the Knowledge of this certain and
evident Truth, That _there is an eternal, most powerful, and most knowing
Being_; which whether any one will please to call God, it matters not. The thing
is evident, and from this _Idea_ duly considered, will easily be deduced all
those other Attributes, we ought to ascribe to this eternal Being. From what has
been said, it is plain to me, we have a more certain Knowledge of the Existence
of a GOD, than of any thing our Senses have not immediately discovered to us.
Nay, I presume I may say, that we more certanly know that there is a GOD, than
that there is any thing else without us When I say we _know,_ I mean there is
such a Knowledge within our reach, which we cannot miss, if we will but apply
our Minds to that, as we do to several other Enquiries.

{#7} _How far the_ Ideas _of a most perfect Being,_ which a Man may frame in his
Mind, _does, or does not prove the Existence of a God,_ I will not here examine.
For in the different Make of Men's Tempers, and Application of their Thoughts,
some Arguments prevail more on one, and some on another, for the Confirmation of
the same Truth. But yet, I think, this I may say, that it is an ill way of
establishing this Truth, and silencing Atheists, to lay the whole stress of so
important a Point, as this, upon that sole Foundation: and take some Men's
having that _Idea_ of God in their Minds, (for 'tis evident, some Men have none,
and some worse than none, and the most very different,) for the only proof of a
Deity; and out of an over fondness of that Darling Invention, cashier, or at
least endeavour to invalidate all other Arguments, and forbid us to hearken to
those proofs, as being weak, or fallacious, which our own Existence, and the
sensible parts of the Universe, offer so clearly, and cogently to our Thoughts,
that I deem it impossible for a considering Man to withstand them. For I judge
it as certain and clear a Truth, as can any where be delivered, That the
invisible Things of God, are clearly seen from the Creation of the World, being
understood by the Things that are made, even his Eternal Power, and God-head.
Though our own Being furnishes us, as I have shewn, with an evident, and
incontestable proof of a Deity. And I beleive no Body can avoid the Cogency of
it, who will but as carefully attend to it, as to any other Demonstration of so
many parts: yet this being so fundamental a Truth, and of that Consequence, that
all Religion and genuine Morality depend thereon, I doubt not but I shall be
forgiven by my Reader, if I go over some parts of this Argument again, and
enlarge a little more upon them.

{#8} There is no Truth more evident, than that _something_ must be _from
Eternity._ I never yet heard of any one so unreasonable, or that could suppose
so manifest a Contradiction, as a Time, wherein there was perfectly nothing.
This being of all Absurdities the greatest, to imagine that pure nothing, the
perfect Negation and Absence of all Beings, should ever produce any real
Existence. It being then unavoidable for all rational Creatures, to conclude,
that something has existed from Eternity. Let us next see what kind of thing
that must be.

{#9} There are but two sorts of Beings in the World, that Man knows or
conceives. _First,_ Such as are purely material, without Sense, Perception, or
Thought, as the clippings of our Beards, and paring of our Nails. _Secondly,_
Sensible, thinking, perceiving Beings, such as we find our selves to be, which
if you please, we will hereafter call _cogitative and incogitative_ Beings;
which to our present purpose, if for nothing else, are, perhaps, better Terms,
than material and immaterial.

{#10} If then there must be something eternal, let us see what sort of Being it
must be. And to that, it is very obvious to Reason, that it must necessarily be
a cogitative Being. For it is as impossible to conceive, that ever bare
incogitative Matter should produce a thinking intelligent Being, as that nothing
should of it self produce Matter. Let us suppose any part of Matter eternal,
great or small, we shall find it, in it self, able to produce nothing. For
Example; let us suppose the Matter of the next Peble, we meet with, eternal,
closely united, and the parts firmly at rest together, if there were no other
Being in the World, Must it not eternally remain so, a dead inactive Lump? Is it
possible to conceive it can add Motion to it self, being purely Matter, or
produce any thing? Matter then, by its own Strength, cannot produce in it self
so much as Motion: the Motion it has, must also be from Eternity, or else be
produced, and added to Matter by some other Being more powerful than Matter;
Matter, as is evident, having no Power to produce Motion in it self. But let us
suppose Motion eternal too; yet Matter, _incogitative Matter_ and Motion,
whatever changes it might produce of Figure and Bulk, _could never produce
Thought_: Knowledge will still be as far beyond the Power of Motion and Matter
to produce, as Matter is beyond the Power of nothing to produce. And I appeal to
every one's own Thoughts, whether he cannot as easily conceive Matter produced
by nothing, as Thought to be produced by pure Matter, when before there was no
such thing as Thought, or an intelligent Being existing. Divide Matter into as
minute parts as you will, (which we are apt to imagine a sort of spiritualizing,
or making a thinking thing of it,) vary the Figure and Motion of it, as much as
you please, a Globe, Cube, Cone, Prism, Cylinder, _&c._ whose Diametres are but
1000000th part of a _Gry_[n1] will operate no otherwise upon other Bodies of
proportionable Bulk, than those of an inch or foot Diametre; and you may as
rationally expect to produce Sense, Thought, and Knowledge, by putting together
in a certain Figure and Motion gross Particles of Matter, as by those that are
the very minutest, that do any where exist. They knock, impell, and resist one
another, just as the greater do, and that is all they can do. So that if we will
suppose nothing first, or eternal, Matter can never begin to be: If we suppose
bare Matter, without Motion, eternal, Motion can never begin to be: If we
suppose only Matter and Motion first, or eternal, Thought can never begin to be.
Whatsoever therefore is eternal, must be a cogitative Being, a Spirit:
Whatsoever is first of all Things, must necessarily contain in it, and actually
have, at least, all the Perfections that can ever after exist: nor can it ever
give to another any perfection that it hath not, either actually in it self, or
at least in a higher degree.

{#11} _If_ therefore it be evident, that _something_ necessarily must _exist
from Eternity,_ 'tis also as evident, that _that Something must_ necessarily _be
a cogitative Being_: For it is as impossible, that incogitative Matter should
produce a cogitative Being, as that nothing, or the negation of all Being,
should produce a positive Being, or Matter.

{#12} Though this discovery of the _necessary Existence of an eternal Mind,_ do
sufficiently lead us into the Knowledge of a GOD; since it will hence follow,
that all other knowing Beings that have a beginning, must depend on him, and
have no other ways of Knowledge, or extent of Power, than what he gives them:
and therefore if he made those, he made also the less-excellent pieces of this
Universe, all inanimate Beings, whereby his Omniscience, Power, and Providence,
will be established, and all his other Attributes necessarily follow: yet to
clear up this a little farther, we will see what Doubts can be raised against
it.

{#13} _First,_ Perhaps it will be said, that though it be as clear as
demonstration can make it, that there must be an eternal Being, and that Being
must also be knowing: Yet it does not follow, but that thinking Being may also
be material. Let it be so; it equally still follows, that there is a GOD. For if
there be an Eternal, Omniscient, Omnipotent Being, it is certain, that there is
a GOD, whether you imagine that Being to be material, or no. But herein, I
suppose, lies the danger and deceit of that Supposition: There being no way to
avoid the demonstration, that there is an eternal knowing Being, Men, devoted to
Matter, would willingly have it granted, that this knowing Being is material;
and then letting slide out of their Minds, or the Discourse, the demonstration
whereby an eternal knowing Being was proved necessarily to exist, would argue
all to be Matter, and so deny a GOD, that is, an eternal cogitative Being:
whereby they are so far from establishing, that they destroy their own
Hypothesis. For if there can be, in their Opinion, eternal Matter, without an
eternal cogitative Being, they manifestly separate Matter and Thinking, and
suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other, and so establish the
necessity of an eternal Spirit, but not of Matter; since it has been proved
already, that an eternal cogitative Being, is unavoidably to be granted. Now if
Thinking and Matter may be separated, _the eternal Existence of Matter, will not
follow from the eternal Existence of a cogitative Being,_ and they suppose it to
no purpose.

{#14} But now let us see how they can satisfie themselves, or others, that this
_eternal thinking Being_ is _material._ _First,_ I would ask them, Whether they
imagine, that all Matter, _every particle of Matter, thinks?_ This, I suppose,
they will scarce say; since then there would be as many eternal thinking Beings,
as there are Particles of Matter, and so an infinity of Gods. And yet if they
will not allow Matter as Matter; that is, every Particle of Matter to be as well
cogitative, as extended, they will have as hard a task to make out to their own
Reason, cogitative Being out of incogitative Particles, as an extended Being,
out of unextended Parts, if I may so speak.

{#15} _Secondly,_ If all Matter do not think, I next ask, Whether it be _only
one Atom that does so_? This has as many Absurdities as the other; for then this
Atom of Matter, must be alone eternal, or not. If this alone be eternal, then
this alone, by its powerful Thought, or Will, made all the rest of Matter. And
so we have the creation of Matter by a powerful Thought, which is that the
Materialists stick at. For if they suppose one single thinking Atom, to have
produced all the rest of Matter, they cannot ascribe that Pre-eminency to it
upon any other account, than that of its Thinking, the only supposed difference.
But allow it to be by some other way, which is above our conception, it must be
still Creation; and these Men must give up their great Maxim, _Ex nihilo nil
fit._ If it be said, that all the rest of Matter is equally eternal, as that
thinking Atom, it will be to say any thing at pleasure, though never so absurd:
For to suppose all Matter eternal, and yet one small particle in Knowledge and
Power infinitely above all the rest, is without any the least appearance of
Reason to frame any Hypothesis: Every particle of Matter, as Matter, is capable
of all the same Figures and Motions of any other; and I challenge any one in his
Thoughts, to add any Thing else to one above another.

{#16} _Thirdly,_ If then neither one peculiar Atom alone, can be this eternal
thinking Being; nor all Matter, as Matter; _i. e._ every particle of Matter can
be it, it only remains, that it is _some certain System of Matter_ duly put
together, that is this _thinking eternal Being._ This is that which, I imagine,
is that Notion which Men are aptest to have of GOD, who would have him a
material Being, as most readily suggested to them, by the ordinary conceit they
have of themselves, and other Men, which they take to be material thinking
Beings. But this Imagination, however more natural, is no less absurd than the
other: For to suppose the eternal thinking Being, to be nothing else but a
composition of Particles of Matter, each whereof is incogitative, is to ascribe
all the Wisdom and Knowledge of that eternal Being, only to the _juxta_-position
of parts; than which, nothing can be more absurd. For unthinking Particles of
Matter, however put together, can have nothing thereby added to them, but a new
relation of Position, which 'tis impossible should give thought and knowledge to
them.

{#17} But farther, this _corporeal System_ either has all its parts at rest, or
it is a certain motion of the parts wherein its Thinking consists. If it be
perfectly at rest, it is but one lump, and so can have no privileges above one
Atom. If it be the motion of its parts, on which its Thinking depends, all the
Thoughts there must be unavoidably accidental, and limitted; since all the
Particles that by Motion cause Thought, being each of them in it self without
any Thought, cannot regulate its own Motions, much less be regulated by the
Thought of the whole; since that Thought is not the cause of Motion, (for then
it must be antecedent to it, and so without it,) but the consequence of it,
whereby Freedom, Power, Choice, and all rational and wise thinking or acting,
will be quite taken away: So that such a thinking Being, will be no better nor
wiser, than pure blind Matter; since to resolve all into the accidental unguided
motions of blind Matter, or into Thought depending on unguided motions of blind
Matter, is the same thing; not to mention the narrowness of such Thoughts and
Knowledge, that must depend on the motion of such parts. But there needs no
enumeration of any more Absurdities and Impossibilities in this Hypothesis,
(however full of them it be,) than that before-mentioned; since let this
thinking System be all, or a part of the Matter of the Universe, it is
impossible that any one Particle, should either know its own, or the motion of
any other Particle, or the Whole know the motion of every Particular; and so
regulate its own Thoughts or Motions, or indeed have any Thought resulting from
such Motion.

{#18} Others would have _Matter_ to be _eternal,_ notwithstanding that they
allow an eternal, cogitative, immaterial Being. This, tho' it take not away the
Being of a _God,_ yet since it denies one and the first great piece of his
Workmanship, the Creation, let us consider it a little. _Matter_ must be allow'd
eternal: Why? Because you cannot conceive how it can be made out of nothing, why
do you not also think your self eternal? You will answer, perhaps, Because about
twenty or forty years since, you began to be. But if I ask you, what that _You_
is, which began to be, you can scarce tell me. The Matter whereof you are made,
began not then to be: for if it did, then it is not eternal: But it began to be
put together in such a fashion and frame, as makes up your Body; but yet that
frame of Particles, is not You, it makes not that thinking Thing You are; (for I
have now to do with one, who allows an eternal, immaterial, thinking Being, but
would have unthinking Matter eternal too;) therefore when did that thinking
Thing begin to be? If it did never begin to be, then have you always been a
thinking Thing from Eternity; the absurdity whereof I need not confute, till I
meet with one who is so void of Understanding, as to own it. If therefore you
can allow a thinking Thing, to be made out of nothing, (as all Things that are
not eternal must be,) why also can you not allow it possible, for a material
Being to be made out of nothing, by an equal Power, but that you have the
experience of the one in view, and not of the other? Though, when well
considered, Creation of one, as well as t'other, requires an equal Power: And we
have no more reason to boggle at the effect of that Power in one, than in the
other; because the manner of it in both, is equally beyond our comprehension.
For the Creation, or beginning of any one thing out of nothing, being once
admitted, the Creation of every thing else, but the CREATOR Himself, may, with
the same ease, be supposed.

{#19} But you will say, Is it not impossible to admit of the _making any thing
out of nothing,_ since we cannot possibly conceive it? I answer, No: 1. Because
it is not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite Being, because we cannot
comprehend its Operations. We do not deny other effects upon this ground,
because we cannot possibly conceive their Production, we cannot conceive how
Thought (or any thing but motion in Body) can move Body: and yet that is not a
Reason sufficient to make us deny it possible, against the constant Experience
we have of it in our selves, in all our voluntary Motions which are produced in
us, only by the free Thoughts of our own Minds; and are not, nor cannot be the
effects of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind Matter, in or
upon our Bodies; for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it.
For example: My right Hand writes, whilst my left Hand is still: What causes
rest in one, and motion in the other? Nothing but my Will, a Thought of my Mind;
my Thought only changing, the right Hand rests and the left Hand moves. This is
matter of fact, which cannot be denied: Explain this, and make it intelligible,
and then the next step will be to understand Creation. In the mean time, 'tis an
overvaluing our selves, to reduce all to the narrow measure of our Capacities;
and to conclude, all things impossible to be done, whose manner of doing exceeds
our Comprehension. This is to make our Comprehension infinite, or GOD finite,
when what he can do, is limitted to what we can conceive of it. If you do not
understand the Operations of your own finite Mind, that thinking Thing within
you, do not deem it strange, that you cannot comprehend the Operations of that
eternal infinite Mind, who made and governs all Things, and whom the Heaven of
Heavens cannot contain.

{#n1} _A Gry is _1/10_ of a line, a line _1/10_ of an inch, an inch _1/10_ of a
philosophical foot, a philosophical foot _1/3_ of a pendulum, whose Diadroms, in
the latitude of _45_ degrees, are each equal to one Second of time, or _1/60_ of
a minute. I have affectedly made use of this measure here, and the parts of it,
under a decimal division with names to them; because, I think, it would be of
general convenience, that this should be the common measure in the Commonwealth
of Letters._
