£2 _Of the Degrees of our Knowledge._ £2

{#1} ALL our Knowledge consisting, as I have said, in the view the Mind has of
its own _Ideas,_ which is the utmost Light and greatest Certainty, we with our
Faculties, and in our way of Knowledge are capable of, it may not be amiss, to
consider a little the degrees of its Evidence. The different clearness of our
Knowledge seems to me to lie in the different way of Perception, the Mind has of
the Agreement, or Disagreement of any of its _Ideas._ For if we will reflect on
our own ways of Thinking, we shall find, that sometimes the Mind perceives the
Agreement or Disagreement of two _Ideas_ immediately by themselves, without the
intervention of any other: And this, I think, we may call _intuitive Knowledge._
For in this, the Mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the
Truth, as the Eye doth Light, only by being directed toward it. Thus the Mind
perceives, that _White_ is not _Black,_ That a Circle is not a Triangle, That
_Three_ are more than _Two,_ and equal to _One and Two._ Such kind of Truths,
the Mind perceives at the first Sight of the _Ideas_ together, by bare
intuition, without the intervention of any other _Idea_; and this kind of
Knowledge is the clearest, and most certain, that humane Frailty is capable of.
This part of Knowledge is irresistible, and like the bright Sun-shine, forces it
self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its view that
way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt, or Examination, but the Mind is
presently filled with the clear Light of it. 'Tis on this Intuition, that
depends all the Certainty and Evidence of all our Knowledge, which Certainty
every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not
require a greater: For a Man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater
Certainty, than to know that any _Idea_ in his Mind is such, as he perceives it
to be; and that two _Ideas,_ wherein he perceives a difference, are different,
and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater Certainty than this,
demands he knows not what; and shews only that he has a Mind to be a Sceptick,
without being able to be so. Certainty depends so wholly on this Intuition, that
in the next degree of _Knowledge,_ which I call _Demonstrative,_ this intuition
is necessary in all the Connexions of the intermediate _Ideas,_ without which we
cannot attain Knowledge and Certainty.

{#2} The next degree of Knowledge is, where the Mind perceives the Agreement or
Disagreement of any _Ideas,_ but not immediately. Though where-ever the Mind
perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any of its _Ideas,_ there be certain
Knowledge: Yet it does not always happen, that the Mind sees that Agreement or
Disagreement, which there is between them, even where it is discoverable; and in
that case, remains in Ignorance, or at most, gets no farther than a probable
conjecture. The Reason why the Mind cannot always perceive presently the
Agreement or Disagreement of two _Ideas_ is, because those _Ideas,_ concerning
whose Agreement or Disagreement the Enquiry is made, cannot by the Mind be so
put together, as to shew it. In this Case then, when the Mind cannot so bring
it's _Ideas_ together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were
Juxta-position, or application one to another, to perceive their Agreement or
Disagreement, it is fain, by the Intervention of other _Ideas_ (one or more, as
it happens) to discover the Agreement or Disagreement, which it searches; and
this is that which we call _Reasoning._ Thus the Mind being willing to know the
Agreement or Disagreement in bigness, between the three Angles of a Triangle,
and two right ones, cannot by an immediate view and comparing them, do it:
Because the three Angles of a Triangle cannot be brought at once, and be
compared with any other one, or two Angles; and so of this the Mind has no
immediate, no intuitive Knowledge. In this Case the Mind is fain to find out
some other Angles, to which the three Angles of a Triangle have an Equality; and
finding those equal to two right ones, comes to know their Equality to two right
ones.

{#3} Those intervening _Ideas,_ which serve to shew the Agreement of any two
others, are called _Proofs_; and where the Agreement or Disagreement is by this
means plainly and clearly perceived, it is called _Demonstration,_ it being
shewn to the Understanding, and the Mind made see that it is so. A quickness in
the Mind to find out these intermediate _Ideas,_ (that shall discover the
Agreement or Disagreement of any other,) and to apply them right, is, I suppose,
that which is called _Sagacity._

{#4} _This Knowledge by intervening Proofs,_ though it be certain, yet the
Evidence of it is _not_ altogether _so clear_ and bright, nor the assent so
ready, _as_ in _intuitive_ Knowledge. For though in Demonstration, the Mind does
at last perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of the _Ideas_ it considers; yet
'tis not without Pains and Attention: There must be more than one transient view
to find it. A steddy application and pursuit, is required to this Discovery: And
there must be a Progression by steps and degrees, before the Mind can in this
way arrive at Certainty, and come to perceive the Agreement or Repugnancy
between two _Ideas_ that need Proofs, and the Use of Reason to shew it.

{#5} _Another difference between intuitive and demonstrative Knowledge,_ is,
that though in the latter all doubt be removed, when by the Intervention of the
intermediate _Ideas,_ the Agreement or Disagreement is perceived; yet before the
Demonstration there was a doubt, which in intuitive Knowledge cannot happen to
the Mind that has its Faculty of Perception left to a degree capable of distinct
_Ideas,_ no more than it can be a doubt to the Eye, (that can distinctly see
White and Black,) Whether this Ink, and this Paper be all of a Colour. If there
be Sight in the Eyes, it will at first glimpse, without Hesitation, perceive the
Words printed on this Paper, different from the Colour of the Paper: And so if
the Mind have the Faculty of distinct Perception, it will perceive the Agreement
or Disagreement of those _Ideas_ that produce intuitive Knowledge. If the Eyes
have lost the Faculty of seeing, or the Mind of perceiving, we in vain enquire
after the quickness of Sight in one, or clearness of Perception in the other.

{#6} 'Tis true the Perception, produced by demonstration, is also very clear;
but yet it is often with a great abatement of that evident lustre and full
assurance that always accompany that which I call intuitive; like a Face
reflected by several Mirrors one to another, where as long as it retains the
similitude and agreement with the Object, it produces a Knowledge; but 'tis
still every reflection, with a lessening of that perfect Clearness and
Distinctness, which is in the first; till in many removes it has a great mixture
of Dimness, and is not at first Sight so knowable, especially to weak Eyes. Thus
it is with Knowledge, made out by a long train of Proofs.

{#7} Now, _in every step Reason makes in demonstrative Knowledge, there is an
intuitive Knowledge_ of that Agreement or Disagreement it seeks with the next
intermediate _Idea,_ which it uses as a Proof: For if it were not so, that yet
would need a Proof. Since without the Perception of such Agreement or
Disagreement, there is no Knowledge produced: If it be perceived by it self, it
is intuitive Knowledge: If it cannot be perceived by it self, there is need of
some intervening _Idea,_ as a common measure to shew their Agreement or
Disagreement, by which it is plain, that every step in Reasoning, that produces
Knowledge, has intuitive Certainty; which when the Mind perceives, there is no
more required, but to remember it to make the Agreement or Disagreement of the
_Ideas,_ concerning which we enquire visible and certain. So that to make any
thing a Demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the immediate Agreement of
the intervening _Ideas,_ whereby the Agreement or Disagreement of the two
_Ideas_ under Examination (where the one is always the first, and the other the
last in the Account) is found. This intuitive Perception of the Agreement or
Disagreement of the intermediate _Ideas,_ in each Step and Progression of the
Demonstration, must also be carried exactly in the Mind, and a Man must be sure
that no part is left out; which because in long Deductions, and the use of many
Proofs, the Memory does not always so readily and exactly retain: therefore it
comes to pass, that this is more imperfect than intuitive Knowledge, and Men
embrace often Falshoods for Demonstrations.

{#8} The necessity of this intuitive Knowledge, in each step of scientifical or
demonstrative Reasoning, gave occasion, I imagine, to that _mistaken Axiom, that
all Reasoning was_ ex praecognitis & praeconcessis; which how far it is a
mistake, I shall have occasion to shew more at large, where I come to consider
Propositions, and particularly those Propositions, which are called Maxims; and
to shew that 'tis by a mistake, that they are supposed to be the foundations of
all our Knowledge and Reasonings.

{#9} It is _not_ only Mathematicks, or the _Ideas alone of Number, Extension,
and Figure,_ that are _capable of Demonstration,_ no more than it is these
_Ideas_ alone, and their Modes, that are capable of Intuition: For whatever
_Ideas_ we have, wherein the Mind can perceive the immediate Agreement or
Disagreement that is between them, there the Mind is capable of intuitive
Knowledge; and where it can perceive the Agreement or Disagreement of any two
_Ideas,_ by an intuitive Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement they have
with any intermediate _Ideas,_ there the Mind is capable of Demonstration, which
is not limited to _Ideas_ of Extension, or Figure, or Number, or their Modes.

{#10} The Reason why it has been generally sought for, and supposed to be only
in those, I imagine, has been not only the general usefulness of those Sciences:
But because, in comparing their Equality or Excess, the Modes of Numbers have
every the least difference very clear and perceivable: And though in Extension,
every the least Excess is not so perceptible; yet the Mind has found out ways,
to examine and discover demonstratively the just Equality of two Angles, or
Extensions, or Figures, and both these, _i. e._ Numbers and Figures, can be set
down, by visible and lasting marks.

{#11} But in other simple _Ideas,_ whose Modes and differences are made, and
counted by degrees, and not quantity, we have not so nice and accurate a
distinction of their differences, as to perceive, or find ways to measure their
just Equality, or the least Differences. For those other simple _Ideas,_ being
Appearances or Sensations, produced in us by the Size, Figure, Number, and
Motion of minute Corpuscles singly insensible, their different degrees also
depend upon the variation of some, or all of those Causes; which since it cannot
be observed by us in Particles of Matter, whereof each is too subtile to be
perceived, it is impossible for us to have any exact Measures of the different
degrees of these simple _Ideas._ For supposing the Sensation or _Idea_ we name
Whiteness, be produced in us by a certain number of Globules, which having a
verticity about their own Centres, strike upon the _Retina_ of the Eye, with a
certain degree of Rotation, as well as progressive Swiftness; it will hence
easily follow, that the more the superficial parts of any Body are so ordered,
as to reflect the greater number of Globules of Light, and to give them that
proper Rotation, which is fit to produce this Sensation of White in us, the more
White will that Body appear, that, from an equal space sends to the _Retina_ the
greater number of such Corpuscles, with that peculiar sort of Motion. I do not
say, that the nature of Light consists in very small round Globules, nor of
Whiteness, in such a texture of parts as gives a certain Rotation to these
Globules, when it reflects them; for I am not now treating physically of Light,
or Colours: But this, I think, I may say, that I cannot (and I would be glad any
one would make intelligible that he did) conceive how Bodies without us, can any
ways affect our Senses, but by the immediate contact of the sensible Bodies
themselves, as in Tasting and Feeling, or the impulse of some insensible
Particles coming from them, as in Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling; by the
different impulse of which Parts, caused by their different Size, Figure, and
Motion, the variety of Sensations is produced in us.

{#12} Whether then they be Globules, or no; or whether they have a Verticity
about their own Centres, that produce the _Idea_ of Whiteness in us, this is
certain, that the more Particles of Light are reflected from a Body, fitted to
give them that peculiar Motion, which produces the Sensation of Whiteness in us;
and possibly too, the quicker the peculiar Motion is, the whiter does the Body
appear, from which the greater number are reflected, as is evident in the same
piece of Paper put in the Sunbeams, in the Shade, and in a dark Hole; in each of
which, it will produce in us the _Idea_ of Whiteness in far different degrees.

{#13} Not knowing therefore what number of Particles, nor what Motion of them is
fit to produce any precise degree of Whiteness, we cannot demonstrate the
certain Equality of any two degrees of Whiteness, because we have no certain
Standard to measure them by, nor Means to distinguish every the least real
difference, the only help we have being from our Senses, which in this point
fail us. But where the difference is so great, as to produce in the Mind clearly
distinct _Ideas,_ whose differences can be perfectly retained, there these
_Ideas_ of Colours, as we see in different kinds, as Blue and Red, are as
capable of Demonstration, as _Ideas_ of Number and Extension. What I have here
said of Whiteness and Colours, I think, holds true in all secundaries Qualities
and their Modes.

{#14} These two, (_viz._) Intuition and Demonstration, are the degrees of our
Knowledge; whatever comes short of one of these, with what assurance soever
embraced, is but Faith, or Opinion, but not Knowledge, at least in all general
Truths. There is, indeed, another _Perception of_ the Mind, employ'd about _the
particular existence of finite Beings_ without us; which going beyond bare
probability, and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the fore-going degrees
of Certainty, passes under the name of Knowledge. There can be nothing more
certain, than that the _Idea_ we receive from an external Object is in our
Minds; this is intuitive Knowledge. But whether there be any thing more than
barely that _Idea_ in our Minds, whether we can thence certainly infer the
existence of any thing without us, which corresponds to that _Idea,_ is that
whereof some Men think there may be a Question made, because Men may have such
_Ideas_ in their Minds, when no such Thing exists, no such Object affects their
Senses. But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us
past doubting: For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to
himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks
on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only
thinks on that Savour, or Odour? We as plainly find the difference there is
between any _Idea_ revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming
into our Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct _Ideas._ If any
one say, a Dream may do the same thing, and all these _Ideas_ may be produced in
us, without any external Objects, he may please to dream, that I make him this
answer, 1. That 'tis no great matter, whether I remove his Scruple, or no: Where
all is but dream, Reasoning and Arguments are of no use, Truth and Knowledge
nothing. 2. That I believe he will allow a very manifest difference between
dreaming of being in a Fire, and being actually in it. But yet if he be resolved
to appear so sceptical, as to maintain, that what I call being actually in the
Fire, is nothing but a dream; and that we cannot thereby certainly know, that
any such thing as Fire actually exists without us; I answer, That we certainly
finding, that Pleasure or Pain follows upon the application of certain Objects
to us, whose Existence we perceive, or dream that we perceive, by our Senses;
this Certainty is as great as our Happiness, or Misery; beyond which, we have no
concernment to know, or to be. So that, I think, we may add to the two former
sorts of Knowledge, this also, of the existence of particular external Objects,
by that perception and consciousness we have of the actual entrance of _Ideas_
from them, and allow these _three degrees of Knowledge,_ viz. _Intuitive,
Demonstrative, and Sensitive_: in each of which, there are different degrees and
ways of Evidence and Certainty.

{#15} But since our Knowledge is founded on, and employ'd about only our
_Ideas,_ Will it not follow from thence, that it is conformable to our _Ideas_;
and that where our _Ideas_ are clear and distinct, or obscure and confused, our
Knowledge will be so too? To which I answer, No: For our Knowledge consisting in
the perception of the Agreement, or Disagreement of any two _Ideas,_ its
clearness or obscurity, consists in the clearness or obscurity of that
Perception, and not in the clearness or obscurity of the _Ideas_ themselves: _v.
g._ a Man that has as clear _Ideas_ of the Angles of a Triangle, and of Equality
to two right ones, as any Mathematician in the World, may yet have but a very
obscure Perception of their Agreement, and so have but a very obscure Knowledg
of it. But obscure and confused _Ideas,_ can never produce any clear or distinct
Knowledge; because as far as any _Ideas_ are confused, or obscure, so far the
Mind can never perceive clearly, whether they agree, or disagree.
