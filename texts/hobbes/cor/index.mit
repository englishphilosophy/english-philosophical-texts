  [De Corpore] was first published in Latin in 1655, and then published in
  English in 1656, as [The Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning
  Body]. Our copytext is this first English edition. As the English title
  indicates, it was apparently conceived as the first part of a larger work.
  Part 2, [De Homine], was published in Latin in 1658, but never appeared in
  English translation (and is therefore not included on this site). Part 3, [De
  Cive], was in fact the first part Hobbes wrote, and was published in Latin in
  1642. It was also the first to appear in translation, published in 1651 as
  [Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and
  Society](https://englishphilosophy.org/texts/hobbes/civ).
