{#1} THere is a Story somewhere, of one that pretends to have been miraculously
cured of Blindness (wherewith he was born) by St. _Albane_ or other Saints, at
the Town of St. _Albans_; and that the Duke of _Glocester_ being there, to be
satisfied of the Truth of the Miracle, asked the Man, What Colour is this? Who,
by answering, It was Green, discovered himself, and was punished for a
Counterfeit: for though by his Sight newly received he might distinguish between
Green, and Red, and all other Colours, as well as any that should interrogate
him, yet he could not possibly know at first Sight which of them was called
Green, or Red, or by any other Name. By this we may understand, there be _two
Kinds_ of Knowledge, whereof the _one_ is nothing else but _Sense,_ or Knowledge
_original,_ as I have said in the Beginning of the second Chapter, and
_Remembrance_ of the same; the _other_ is called _Science_ or Knowledge of the
_Truth of Propositions,_ and how Things are called; and is derived from
_Vnderstanding._ Both of these Sorts are but _Experience_; The former being the
Experience of the Effects of Things that work upon us from _without_; and the
latter Experience Men have from the proper Use of _Names_ in Language: and all
Experience being, as I have said, but Remembrance, all Knowledge is Remembrance:
and of the _former,_ the Register we keep in Books, is called _History_; But the
Registers of the _latter_ are called the _Sciences._

{#2} There are _two Things_ necessarily implied in this Word _Knowledge_; the
one is _Truth,_ the other _Evidence_: for what is not Truth, can never be known.
For, let a Man say he knoweth a Thing never so well, if the same shall
afterwards appear false, he is driven to Confession, that it was not Knowledge,
but Opinion. Likewise, if the Truth be not evident, though a Man holdeth it, yet
is his Knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold the contrary: for if Truth
were enough to make it Knowledge, all Truth were known; which is not so.

{#3} What _Truth_ is, hath been defined in the _precedent_ Chapter; What
_Evidence_ is, I _now_ set down: and it is the Concomitance of a Mans
_Conception_ with the _Words_ that signifie such Conception in the Act of
Ratiocination: for when a Man reasoneth with his Lips only, to which the Mind
suggesteth only the Beginning, and followeth not the Words of his Mouth with the
Conceptions of his Mind, out of Custom of so speaking; though he begin his
Ratiocination with True Propositions, and proceed with certain Syllogisms, and
thereby make always true Conclusions; yet are not his Conclusions _evident_ to
him, for Want of the _Concomitance_ of _Conception_ with his Words: for if the
Words alone were sufficient, a _Parrot_ might be taught as well to know Truth,
as to speak it. Evidence is to Truth, as the Sap to the Tree, which, so far as
it creepeth along with Body and Branches, keepeth them alive; where it forsaketh
them, they die: for this Evidence, which is Meaning with our Words, is the Life
of Truth.

{#4} Knowledge therefore which we call _Science,_ I define to be _Evidence of
Truth,_ from some Beginning or Principle of _Sense_: for the Truth of a
Proposition is never evident, until we conceive the Meaning of the Words or
Terms whereof it consisteth, which are always Conceptions of the Mind: Nor can
we remember those Conceptions, without the Thing that produced the same by our
Senses. The _first_ Principle of Knowledge is, that we have such and such
_Conceptions_; the _second,_ that we have thus and thus _named_ the Things
whereof they are Conceptions; the _third_ is, that we have _joyned_ those
_Names_ in such Manner as to make true Propositions; the _fourth_ and last is,
that we have _joyned_ those _Propositions_ in such Manner as they be concluding,
and the Truth of the Conclusion said to be known. And of these two Kinds of
Knowledge, whereof the former is _Experience of Fact,_ and the later of
_Evidence of Truth_; as the _former,_ if it be great, is called _Prudence_; so
the _latter,_ if it be much, hath usually been called, both by Ancient and
Modern Writers, _Sapience_ or Wisdom: and of this _latter, Man_ only is capable;
of the _former, brute Beasts_ also participate.

{#5} A Proposition is said to be _supposed,_ when, being _not evident,_ it is
nevertheless _admitted for a Time,_ to the End, that, joyning to it other
Propositions, we may _conclude_ something; and to _proceed_ from Conclusion to
Conclusion, for a _Trial_ whether the same will lead us into any _absurd_ or
impossible Conclusion; which if it _do,_ then we know such Supposition to have
been false.

{#6} But if, running thorow _many_ Conclusions, we come to _none_ that are
_absurd,_ then we think the Proposition _probable_: likewise we think probable
whatsoever Proposition we _admit_ for Truth by Errour of Reasoning, or from
trusting to other Men: And all such Propositions as are admitted by _Trust_ or
errour, we are not said to _know,_ but _think_ them to be true; and the
Admittance of them is called _Opinion._

{#7} And particularly, when the Opinion is admitted out of _Trust_ to _other_
Men, they are said to _believe_ it; and their Admittance of it is called
_Belief,_ and sometimes _Faith._

{#8} It is either _Science_ or _Opinion_ which we commonly mean by the Word
_Conscience_: for Men say that such and such a thing is true in or upon their
Conscience; which they _never_ do, when they think it _doubtful_; and therefore
they _know,_ or _think_ they know it to be true. But Men, when they say Things
upon their Conscience, are not therefore presumed certainly to know the Truth of
what they say: It remaineth then, that that Word is used by them that have an
_Opinion, not_ only of the _Truth_ of the Thing, _but_ also of their _Knowledge_
of it, to which the _Truth_ of the Proposition is consequent. _Conscience_ I
therefore define to be _Opinion of Evidence._

{#9} _Belief,_ which is the admitting of Propositions upon _Trust,_ in many
Cases is no less free from _Doubt,_ than perfect and manifest _Knowledge_: for
as there is nothing whereof there is not some Cause; so, when there is Doubt,
there must be some Cause thereof conceived Now there be many Things which we
receive from _Report of others,_ of which it is impossible to imagine any Cause
of _Doubt_: for what can be opposed against the Consent of all Men, in Things
they can know, and have no Cause to report otherwise than they are, (such as is
great Part of our _Histories_) unless a Man would say that all the World had
_conspired_ to deceive him. And thus much of _Sense, Imagination, Discursion,
Ratiocination,_ and _Knowledge,_ which are the Acts of our _Power cognitive,_ or
_conceptive._ That Power of the _Mind_ which we call _motive,_ differeth from
the Power _motive_ of the _Body_: for the Power _motive_ of the _Body_ is that
by which it _moveth other Bodies,_ and we call _Strength_; but the Power motive
of the _Mind,_ is that by which the Mind giveth _animal Motion_ to that _Body_
wherein it existeth: the Acts hereof are our _Affections_ and _Passions,_ of
which I am to speak in general.
