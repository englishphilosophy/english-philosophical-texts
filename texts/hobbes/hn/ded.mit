£1 To the Right Honourable, WILLIAM EARL OF NEW-CASTLE, Governour to the Prince
his Highness, One of His Majesties Most Honourable Privy Council. £1

{#1} My most Honoured Lord, //
FRom the principal parts of Nature, Reason and Passion, have proceeded two kinds
of Learning, _Mathematical_ and _Dogmatical_: the former is free from
Controversie and Dispute, because it consisteth in comparing Figure and Motion
only; in which things, _Truth,_ and _the Interest of Men,_ oppose not each
other: but in the other there is nothing undisputable, because it compareth Men,
and medleth with their Right and Profit; in which, as oft as Reason is against a
Man, so oft will a Man be against Reason. And from hence it cometh, that they
who have written of Justice and Policy in General, do all invade each other and
themselves with Contradictions. To reduce this Doctrine to the Rules and
Infallibility of Reason, there is no way but, first, put such Principles down
for a Foundation, as Passion, not mistrusting, may not seek to displace; and
afterwards to build thereon the Truth of Cases in the Law of Nature (which
hitherto have been built in the Air) by degrees, till the whole have been
inexpugnable. Now, my Lord, the Principles fit for such a Foundation, are those
which heretofore I have acquainted your Lordship withal in private Discourse,
and which by your Command I have here put into a Method. To examine Cases
thereby between _Soveraign_ and _Soveraign,_ or between _Soveraign_ and
_Subject,_ I leave to them that shall find Leasure and Encouragement thereto:
For my part, I present this to your Lordship for the true and only Foundation of
such Science. For the Stile, it is therefore the worse, because, whilest I was
writing, I consulted more with Logick than with Rhetorick: But for the Doctrine,
it is not slightly proved; and the Conclusions thereof of such Nature, as, for
want of them. Government and Peace have been nothing else, to this day, but
mutual Fears: And it would be an incomparable benefit to Commonwealth, that
every one held the Opinion concerning _Law_ and _Policy_ here delivered. The
ambition therefore of this Book, in seeking by your Lordships countenance to
insinuate it self with those whom the matter it containeth most nearly
concerneth, is to be excused. For my self, I desire no greater honour than I
enjoy already in your Lordship's favour, unless it be that you would be pleased,
in Continuance thereof, to give me more Exercise in your commands; which, as I
am bound by your many great Favours, I shall obey, being, //
~~My most honoured Lord, //
~~Your most humble, //
~~~~and most obliged Servant, //
~~THO. HOBBS. #May 9. 1640.#
