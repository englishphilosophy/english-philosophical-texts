{#1} THe _Succession_ of Conceptions in the Mind, Series or Consequence of one
after another, may be _casual_ and incoherent, as in Dreams for the most part;
and it may be _orderly,_ as when the former Thought introduceth the latter; and
this is _Discourse_ of the Mind. But because the Word Discourse is commonly
taken for the _Coherence_ and Consequence of Words, I will, to avoid
Aequivocation, call it _Discursion._

{#2} The _Cause_ of the _Coherence_ or Consequence of one Conception to another,
is their first _Coherence_ or Consequence at that _Time_ when they are produced
by Sense: As for Example, from St. _Andrew_ the Mind runneth to St. _Peter,_
because their Names are read together; from S. _Peter_ to a _Stone,_ for the
same Cause; from _Stone_ to _Foundation,_ because we see them together; and for
the same Cause, from Foundation to _Church,_ and from Church to _People,_ and
from People to _Tumult_: and according to this Example, the Mind may run almost
from any Thing to any Thing. But as in the _Sense_ the Conception of Cause and
Effect may succeed one another; so may they after Sense in the _Imagination_:
And for the most part they do so; the _Cause_ whereof is the _Appetite_ of them,
who, having a Conception of the _End,_ have next unto it a Conception of the
next _Means_ to that End; As, when a Man, from a Thought of _Honour_ to which he
hath an Appetite, cometh to the Thought of _Wisdom,_ which is the next Means
thereunto; and from thence to the Thought of _Study,_ which is the next Means to
Wisdom.

{#3} To omit that kind of Discursion by which we proceed from any Thing to any
Thing, there are of the _other_ Kind _divers_ Sorts: As first, in the _Senses_
there are certain Coherences of Conceptions, which we may call _ranging:_
Examples whereof are; A Man casteth his _Eye_ upon the _Ground,_ to look about
for some _small_ Thing lost; the _Hounds_ casting about at a Fault in hunting;
and the _Ranging_ of Spaniels: and herein we take a Beginning arbitrary.

{#4} Another sort of Discursion is, when the _Appetite_ giveth a Man his
Beginning, as in the Example before, where Honour to which a Man hath Appetite,
maketh him think upon the next Means of attaining it, and that again of the
next, _&c._ And this the Latines call _Sagacitas_▪ and We may call _Hunting_ or
_Tracing,_ as Dogs trace Beasts by the Smell, and Men hunt them by their
Footsteps; or as Men hunt after Riches, Place, or Knowledge.

{#5} There is yet another Kind of Discursion beginning with the Appetite to
_recover_ something lost, proceeding from the _present backward,_ from Thought
of the Place where we _miss_ at, to the Thought of the Place from whence we came
last; and from the Thought of that, to the Thought of a Place _before,_ till we
have in our Mind some Place, wherein we had the Thing we miss: and this is
called _Reminiscence._

{#6} The _Remembrance_ of Succession of one Thing to another, that is, of what
was _antecedent,_ and what _consequent,_ and what _concomitant,_ is called an
_Experiment_; whether the same be made by us _voluntarily,_ as when a Man
putteth any Thing into the Fire, to see what Effect the Fire will produce upon
it: or _not_ made by us, as when we remember a fair Morning after a red Evening.
To have had many _Experiments,_ is that we call _Experience,_ which is nothing
else but _Remembrance_ of what Antecedents have been followed by what
Consequents.

{#7} No man can have in his Mind a Conception of the _future_; for the future is
_not yet:_ but of our Conceptions of the past, we make a _future_; or rather,
call _past, future_ relatively. Thus after a Man hath been accustomed to see
like Antecedents follow by like Consequents, whensoever he seeth the like come
to pass to any Thing he had seen before, he looks there should follow it the
same that followed then: As for Example, because a Man hath often seen Offences
followed by Punishment, when he seeth an Offence in present, he thinketh
Punishment to be consequent thereto; but consequent unto that which is present,
Men call future: And thus we make _Remembrance_ to be the _Prevision_ of Things
to come, or _Expectation_ or Presumption of the future.

{#8} In the same Manner, if a Man seeth in present that which he hath seen
before, he thinks that that which was antecedent to that which he saw before, is
also antecedent to that he presently seeth: As for Example, He that hath seen
the Ashes remain after the Fire, and now again seeth ashes, concludeth again
there hath been Fire: And this is called again _Conjecture_ of the past, or
Presumption of the Fact.

{#9} When a Man hath _so often_ observed like Antecedents to be followed by like
Consequents, that _whensoever_ he seeth the Antecedent, he looketh again for the
Consequent; or when he seeth the Consequent, maketh account there hath been the
like Antecedent; then he calleth both the Antecedent and the Consequent, _Signs_
one of another, as Clouds are Signs of Rain to come, and Rain of Clouds past.

{#10} This taking of Signs by _Experience,_ is that wherein Men do ordinarily
think, the Difference stands between Man and Man in _Wisdom,_ by which they
commonly understand a Mans whole Ability or _Power cognitive_; but this is an
_Errour_: for the Signs are but _conjectural_; and according as they have often
or seldom failed, so their _Assurance_ is more or less; but _never full_ and
_evident_: for though a Man have always seen the Day and Night to follow one
another hitherto; yet can he not thence conclude they shall do so, or that they
have done so eternally: _Experience concludeth nothing universally._ If the
Signs hit twenty times for one missing, a Man may lay a Wager of Twenty to One
of the Event; but may not conclude it for a Truth. But by this it is plain, that
they shall _conjecture best,_ that have _most Experience,_ because they have
most Signs to conjecture by; which is the Reason _old Men_ are _more prudent,_
that is, conjecture better, _caeteris paribus,_ than young: for, being old, they
remember more; and Experience is but remembrance. And _men_ of _quick_
imagination, _caeteris paribus,_ are more _prudent_ than those whose
Imaginations are slow: for they observe _more_ in _less_ Time. Prudence is
nothing but Conjecture from Experience, or taking of Signs from Experience
warily, that is, that the Experiments from which he taketh such Signs be all
remembred; for else the Cases are not alike that seem so.

{#11} As in Conjecture concerning things past and future, it is Prudence to
conclude from Experience, what is like to come to pass, or to have passed
already; so it is an errour to conclude from it, that _it is_ so or so _called_;
that is to say, We cannot from Experience conclude, that any Thing is to be
called _just_ or _unjust, true_ or _false,_ or any Proposition _universal_
whatsoever, except it be from Remembrance of the Use of Names imposed
arbitrarily by Men: For Example, to have heard a Sentence given in the like
Case, the like Sentence a thousand times is not enough to conclude that the
Sentence is just; though most Men have no other Means to conclude by: But it is
_necessary,_ for the drawing of such Conclusion, to _trace_ and _find out,_ by
many Experiences, what Men do mean by calling Things just and unjust. Further,
there is another _Caveat_ to be taken in concluding by Experience, from the
tenth Section of the second Chapter; that is, That we conclude such Things to be
without, that are within us.
