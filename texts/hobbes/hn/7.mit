{#1} IN the eighth Section of the second Chapter is shewed, that _Conceptions_
and _Apparitions_ are nothing _really,_ but _Motion_ in some internal Substance
of the _Head_; which Motion _not stopping_ there, but proceeding to the _Heart,_
of Necessity must there either _help_ or _hinder_ the Motion which is called
_Vital_: when it _helpeth,_ it is called _Delight, Contentment,_ or _Pleasure,_
which is nothing really but Motion about the Heart, as Conception is nothing but
Motion in the Head; and the _Objects_ that cause it are called _pleasant_ or
_delightful,_ or by some Name equivalent; The _Latines_ have _Jucundum, à
juvando,_ from helping; and the same Delight, with Reference to the Object, is
called _Love_: but when such Motion _weakeneth_ or hindereth the vital Motion,
then it is called _Pain_; and in Relation to that which causeth it, Hatred,
which the _Latines_ express sometimes by _Odium,_ and sometimes by _Taedium._

{#2} This Motion in which consisteth _Pleasure_ or _Pain,_ is also a
_Solicitation_ or Provocation either to draw _near_ to the Thing that pleaseth,
or to _retire_ from the Thing that displeaseth; and this Solicitation is the
_Endeavour_ or internal Beginning of _animal_ Motion, which when the Object
_delighteth,_ is called _Appetite_; when it _displeaseth,_ it is called
_Aversion,_ in Respect of the Displeasure _present_; but in Respect of the
Displeasure _expected, Fear._ So that _Pleasure, Love,_ and _Appetite,_ which is
also called Desire, are _divers Names_ for divers Considerations of the _same
Thing._

{#3} Every Man, for his own Part, calleth that which _pleaseth,_ and is
delightful to himself, _Good_; and that _Evil_ which _displeaseth_ him: insomuch
that while every Man _differeth_ from other in _Constitution,_ they differ also
from one another concerning the common Distinction of Good and Evil. Nor is
there any such Thing as Absolute Goodness, considered without Relation: for even
the Goodness which we apprehend in God Almighty, is _his Goodness to us._ And as
we call _Good_ and _Evil_ the _Things_ that please and displease; so call we
_Goodness_ and _Badness,_ the _Qualities_ or Powers whereby they do it: And the
Signs of that Goodness are called by the _Latines_ in one Word _Pulchritudo,_
and the Signs of Evil, _Turpitudo_; to which we have no Words precisely
answerable.

{#4} As all Conceptions we have immediately by the _Sense,_ are, _Delight,_ or
_Pain,_ or _Appetite,_ or _Fear_; so are all the _Imaginations_ after Sense. But
as they are weaker Imaginations, so are they also weaker Pleasures, or weaker
Pain.

{#5} As _Appetite_ is the Beginning of _animal_ Motions towards something that
pleaseth us; so is the _attaining_ thereof, the _End_ of that Motion, which we
also call the _Scope,_ and Aim, and final Cause of the same: and when we attain
that End, the Delight we have thereby is called the _Fruition_: So that _Bonum_
and _Finis_ are different Names, but for different Considerations of the same
Thing.

{#6} And of _Ends,_ some of them are called _propinqui,_ that is, near at hand;
others _remoti,_ far off: but when the Ends that be nearer attaining, be
compared with those that be further off, they are called not Ends, but _Means,_
and the _Way_ to those. But for an _utmost_ End, in which the ancient
_Philosophers_ have placed _Felicity,_ and disputed much concerning the Way
thereto, there is no such Thing in this World, nor Way to it, more than to
_Vtopia_: for while we live, we have Desires, and Desire presupposeth a further
End. Those Things which please us, as the Way or _Means_ to a further End, we
call _profitable_; and the _Fruition_ of them, _Vse_; and those Things that
profit not, _vain._

{#7} Seeing all _Delight_ is _Appetite,_ and presupposeth a _further_ End, there
can be _no Contentment_ but in _proceeding_: and therefore we are not to marvel,
when we see, that as Men attain to more Riches, Honour, or other Power; so their
Appetite continually groweth more and more; and when they are come to the utmost
Degree of some Kind of Power, they pursue some other, as long as in any Kind
they think themselves behind any other: of those therefore that have attained to
the highest Degree of Honour and Riches, some have affected Mastery in some Art;
as _Nero_ in Musick and Poetry, _Commodus_ in the Art of a Gladiator; and such
as affect not some such Thing, must find Diversion and Recreation of their
Thoughts in the Contention either of Play or Business: and Men justly complain
of a great Grief, that they know not what to do. _Felicity_ therefore, by which
we mean continual Delight, consisteth _not_ in _having_ prospered, but in
_prospering._

{#8} There are few Things in this World, but _either_ have _Mixture_ of Good and
Evil, _or_ there is a Chain of them so necessarily linked together, that the one
cannot be taken without the other: As for Example, the Pleasures of Sin, and the
Bitterness of Punishment, are inseparable; as is also Labour and Honour, for the
most part. Now when in the _whole Chain,_ the _greater Part_ is good, the
_Whole_ is called _Good_; and when the _Evil_ over-weigheth, the _Whole_ is
called _Evil._

{#9} There are two Sorts of Pleasure, whereof the _one_ seemeth to affect the
_corporeal_ Organ of the Sense, and that I call _sensual_; the _greatest_ Part
whereof, is that by which we are invited to give Continuance to our _Species_;
and the _next,_ by which a Man is invited to Meat, for the Preservation of his
_individual_ Person: The _other Sort_ of Delight is not particular to any Part
of the Body, and is called The Delight of the _Mind,_ and is that which we call
_Joy._ Likewise of _Pains,_ some affect the _Body,_ and are therefore called the
_Pains_ of the Body; and some _not,_ and those are called _Grief._
