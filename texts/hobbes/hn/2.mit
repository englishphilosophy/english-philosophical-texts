10. The main Deception of Sense.

{#1} HAving declared what I mean by the Word _Conception,_ and other Words
equivalent thereunto, I come to the _Conceptions_ themselves, to shew their
_Differences,_ their _Causes,_ and the _Manner of the Production,_ so far as is
necessary for this Place.

{#2} Originally all _Conceptions_ proceed from the _Action_ of the thing it
self, whereof it is the Conception: Now when the Action is _present,_ the
Conception it produceth is also called _Sense_; and the Thing by whose Action
the same is produced, is called the _Object of the Sense._

{#3} By our several _Organs_ we have several _Conceptions_ of several Qualities
in the Objects; for by _Sight_ we have a Conception or Image composed of
_Colour_ and _Figure,_ which is all the Notice and Knowledge the Object
imparteth to us of its Nature by the Eye. By _Hearing_ we have a Conception
called _Sound,_ which is all the Knowledge we have of the Quality of the Object
from the Ear. And so the rest of the Senses are also Conceptions of several
Qualities, or Natures of their Objects.

{#4} Because the _Image_ in Vision consisting of _Colour_ and _Shape_ is the
Knowledge we have of the Qualities of the Object of that Sense; it is no hard
matter for a Man to fall into this Opinion, that the same _Colour_ and _Shape_
are the _very Qualities themselves_; And for the same cause, that _Sound_ and
_Noise_ are the _Qualities of the Bell,_ or of the Air. And this Opinion hath
been so long received, that the _contrary_ must needs appear a great Paradox;
and yet the Introduction of _Species visible_ and _intelligible_ (which is
necessary for the Maintenance of that Opinion) passing to and fro from the
_Object,_ is _worse_ than any Paradox, as being a plain _Impossibility._ I shall
therefore endeavour to make plain these Points: //
~~~~That the Subject wherein Colour and Image are inherent, is _not_ the
_Object_ or thing seen. //
~~~~That there is nothing _without us_ (really) which we call an _Image_ or
Colour. //
~~~~That the said Image or Colour is but an _apparition_ unto us of the
_Motion,_ Agitation, or Alteration, which the _Object_ worketh in the _Brain,_
or Spirits, or some internal Substance of the Head. //
~~~~That as in _Vision,_ so also in Conceptions that arise from the _other
Senses,_ the Subject of their _inherence_ is not the _Object,_ but the
_Sentient._

{#5} Every Man hath so much Experience as to have seen the _Sun_ and the other
visible Objects by Reflection in the _Water_ and _Glasses_; and this alone is
sufficient for this Conclusion, that _Colour_ and _Image_ may be there where the
_Thing seen_ is _not._ But because it may be said that notwithstanding the
_Image_ in the Water be not in the Object, but a Thing meerly _Phantastical,_
yet there may be _Colour_ really in the Thing it self: I will urge further this
Experience, that divers Times Men see directly the _same_ Object _double_; as
_two Candles_ for _one,_ which may happen from Distemper or otherwise without
Distemper if a Man will, the Organs being either in their right Temper, or
equally distempered, the _Colours_ and _Figures_ in two such Images of the same
Thing _cannot be inherent_ therein, because the Thing seen cannot be in _two
Places._ _One_ of these Images therefore is _not inherent_ in the Object: but
seeing the Organs of the Sight are then in equal Temper or Distemper, the _one_
of them is no more inherent than the _other_; and consequently _neither_ of them
both are in the Object; which is the First Proposition, mentioned in the
precedent Number.

{#6} Secondly, that the Image of any Thing by _Reflection_ in a _Glass_ or
_Water_ or the like, is _not_ any Thing _in_ or _behind_ the Glass, or _in_ or
_under_ the Water, every Man may grant to himself; which is the Second
Proposition.

{#7} For the Third, we are to consider, First that every _great Agitation_ or
_Concussion_ of the _Brain_ (as it happeneth from a Stroak, especially if the
Stroak be upon the Eye) whereby the Optick Nerve suffereth any great Violence,
there _appeareth_ before the _Eyes_ a certain _Light,_ which Light is _nothing
without,_ but an Apparition only, all that is real being the Concussion or
Motion of the Parts of that Nerve; from which Experience we may conclude, That
_Apparition of Light is really nothing but Motion_ within. If therefore from
_lucid Bodies_ there can be derived _Motion,_ so as to affect the Optick Nerve
in such manner as is proper thereunto, there will follow an _Image_ of Light
somewhere in that Line by which the Motion was last derived to the Eye; That is
to say, In the Object, if we look directly on it, and in the Glass or Water,
when we look upon it in the Line of Reflection, which in Effect is the Third
Proposition; namely, That Image and Colour is but an Apparition to us of that
Motion, Agitation, or Alteration which the Object worketh in the Brain or
Spirits, or some _internal_ Substance in the Head.

{#8} But that _from all lucid,_ shining and illuminate Bodies, there is a
_Motion produced_ to the Eye, and, through the Eye, to the _Optick_ Nerve, and
so into the _Brain,_ by which that Apparition of _Light_ or _Colour_ is
affected, is not hard to prove. And first, it is evident that the _Fire,_ the
only lucid Body here upon Earth, worketh by _Motion_ equally every Way; insomuch
as the Motion thereof _stopped_ or inclosed, it is presently _extinguished,_ and
no more Fire. And further, that that Motion whereby the Fire worketh, is
_Dilation,_ and _Contraction_ of it self _alternately,_ commonly called
_Scintillation_ or Glowing, is manifest also by Experience. From such _Motion_
in the Fire must needs arise a _Rejection_ or casting from it self of that part
of the _Medium_ which is _contiguous_ to it, whereby that part also rejecteth
the _next,_ and so successively one part beateth back another to the very _Eye_;
and in the same manner the _exteriour_ part of the Eye presseth the _interiour,_
(the Laws of Refraction still observed.) Now the interiour coat of the Eye is
nothing else but a piece of the _Optick_ Nerve; and therefore the Motion is
still continued thereby into the _Brain,_ and by _Resistance_ or Re-action of
the Brain, is also a _Rebound_ into the Optick Nerve again; which we _not
conceiving_ as Motion or Rebound from _within,_ do think it is _without,_ and
call it _Light_; as hath been already shewed by the Experience of a Stroak. We
have no Reason to doubt, that the Fountain of Light, the _Sun,_ worketh by any
other Ways than the _Fire,_ at least in this Matter. And thus all _Vision_ hath
its Original from such _Motion_ as is here described: for where there is no
Light, there is no Sight; and therefore _Colour_ also must be the same Thing
with _Light,_ as being the Effect of the lucid Bodies: their _Difference_ being
only this, that when the Light cometh _directly_ from the Fountain to the Eye,
or _indirectly_ by Reflection from _clean_ and _polite_ Bodies, and such as have
_not_ any particular Motion internal to alter it, we call it _Light_; but when
it cometh to the Eye by Reflection from _uneven_, _rough_, and coarse Bodies,
(or such as are affected with internal Motion of their own that may alter it)
then we call it _Colour_; Colour and Light differing only in this, that the one
is _pure,_ and the other _perturbed_ Light. By that which hath been said, not
only the Truth of the Third Proposition, but also the whole Manner of producing
Light and Colour, is apparent.

{#9} As Colour is not inherent in the Object, but an Effect thereof upon us,
caused by such Motion in the Object, as hath been described: so neither is
_Sound_ in the Thing we hear, but in our selves. One manifest Sign thereof, is,
that as a Man may _see,_ so also he may _hear double_ or _treble,_ by
Multiplication of _Echoes,_ which Echoes are Sounds as well as the Original; and
_not_ being in one and the _same Place,_ cannot be _inherent_ in the Body that
maketh them: Nothing can make any Thing which is not in it self: the _Clapper_
hath no _Sound_ in it, but _Motion,_ and maketh Motion in the internal Parts of
the Bell; so the _Bell_ hath Motion, and not Sound, that imparteth _Motion_ to
the _Air_; and the _Air_ hath Motion, but not Sound; the _Air_ imparteth Motion
by the _Ear_ and _Nerve_ unto the _Brain_; and the Brain hath Motion, but not
Sound: from the _Brain,_ it reboundeth back into the Nerves _outward,_ and
thence it becometh an _Apparition without,_ which we call _Sound._ And to
proceed to the _rest_ of the _Senses,_ it is apparent enough, that the _Smell_
and _Taste_ of the _same Thing,_ are _not_ the _same_ to _every Man_; and
therefore are _not_ in the Thing _smelt_ or _tasted,_ but in the _Men._ So
likewise the _Heat_ we feel from the Fire is manifestly in _us,_ and is quite
_different_ from the Heat which is in the _Fire:_ for _our_ Heat is _Pleasure_
or _Pain,_ according as it is _great_ or _moderate_; but in the _Coal_ there is
no such Thing. By this the Fourth and last Proposition is proved, _viz._ That as
in Vision, so also in Conceptions that arise from _other_ Senses, the Subject of
their Inherence is not in the Object, but in the Sentient.

{#10} And from hence also it followeth, that _whatsoever Accidents_ or Qualities
our Senses make us think there be in the _World,_ they be _not_ there, but are
_Seeming_ and _Apparitions_ only: the Things that really _are_ in the World
without us, are those _Motions_ by which these Seemings are caused. And this is
the _great Deception of Sense,_ which also is to be by Sense _corrected_: for as
Sense telleth me, when I see _directly,_ that the Colour seemeth to _be_ in the
Object; so also Sense telleth me, when I see by Reflection, that Colour is in
the Object.
