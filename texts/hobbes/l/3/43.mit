£1 _Of what is ^Necessary^ for a Mans Reception into the Kingdome of Heaven._ £1

{#1} ^The^ most frequent pr{ae}text of Sedition, and Civill#_The difficulty of
obeying God and Man both at once,_# Warre, in Christian Common-wealths hath a
long time proceeded from a difficulty, not yet sufficiently resolved, of obeying
at once, both God, and Man, then when their Commandements are one contrary to
the other. It is manifest enough, that when a man receiveth two contrary
Commands, and knows that one of them is Gods, he ought to obey that, and not the
other, though it be the command even of his lawfull Soveraign (whether a
Monarch, or a soveraign Assembly,) or the command of his Father. The difficulty
therefore consisteth in this; that men when they are commanded in the name of
God, know not in divers Cases, whether the command be from God, or whether he
that commandeth, doe but abuse Gods name for some private ends of his own. For
as there were in the Church of the Jews, many false Prophets, that sought
reputation with the people, by feigned Dreams, and Visions; so there have been
in all times in the Church of Christ, false Teachers, that seek reputation with
the people, by phantasticall and false Doctrines; and by such reputation (as is
the nature of Ambition,) to govern them for their private benefit.

{#2} But this difficulty of obeying both God, and the Civill#_Is none to them
that distinguish between what is, and what is not Necessary to Salvation._#
Soveraign on earth, to those that can distinguish between what is _Necessary_,
and what is not _Necessary_ for their _Reception_ into the _Kingdome of God_, is
of no moment. For if the command of the Civill Soveraign bee such, as that it
may be obeyed, without the forfeiture of life Eternall; not to obey it is
unjust; and the precept of the Apostle takes place; _Servants obey your Masters
in all things_; and, _Children obey your Parents in all things_; and the precept
of our Saviour, _The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses Chaire, All therefore
they shall say, that observe, and doe_. But if the command be such, as cannot be
obeyed, without being damned to Eternall Death, then it were madnesse to obey
it, and the Counsell of our Saviour takes place, (_Mat_. 10. 28.) _Fear not
those that kill the body, but cannot kill the soule_. All men therefore that
would avoid, both the punishments that are to be in this world inflicted, for
disobedience to their earthly Soveraign, and those that shall be inflicted in
the world to come for disobedience to God, have need be taught to distinguish
well between what is, and what is not Necessary to Eternall Salvation.

{#3} All that is ^Necessary^ _to Salvatian_, is contained in#_All that is
Necessary to Salvation is contained in Faith and Obedience._# two Vertues,
_Faith in Christ_, and _Obedience to Laws_. The latter of these, if it were
perfect, were enough to us. But because wee are all guilty of disobedience to
Gods Law, not onely originally in Adam, but also actually by our own
transgressions, there is required at our hands now, not onely _Obedience_ for
the rest of our time, but also a _Remission_ of sins for the time past; which
Remission is the reward of our Faith in Christ. That nothing else is Necessarily
required to Salvation, is manifest from this, that the Kingdome of Heaven is
shut to none but to Sinners; that is to say, to the disobedient, or
transgressors of the Law; nor to them, in case they Repent, and Beleeve all the
Articles of Christian Faith, Necessary to Salvation.

{#4} #_What Obedience is Necessary;_# The Obedience required at our hands by
God, that accepteth in all our actions the Will for the Deed, is a serious
Endeavour to Obey him; and is called also by all such names as signifie that
Endeavour. And therefore Obedience, is sometimes called by the names of
_Charity_, and _Love_, because they imply a Will to Obey; and our Saviour
himself maketh our Love to God, and to one another, a Fulfilling of the whole
Law: and sometimes by the name of _Righteousnesse_; for Righteousnesse is but
the will to give to every one his owne, that is to say, the will to obey the
Laws: and sometimes by the name of _Repentance_; because to Repent, implyeth a
turning away from sinne, which is the same, with the return of the will to
Obedience. Whosoever therefore unfeignedly desireth to fulfill the Commandements
of God, or repenteth him truely of his transgressions, or that loveth God with
all his heart, and his neighbor as himself, hath all the Obedience Necessary to
his Reception into the Kingdom of God: For if God should require perfect
Innocence, there could no flesh be saved.

{#5} But what Commandements are those that God hath#_And to what Laws._# given
us? Are all those Laws which were given to the Jews by the hand of Moses, the
Commandements of God? If they bee, why are not Christians taught to Obey them?
If they be not, what others are so, besides the Law of Nature? For our Saviour
Christ hath not given us new Laws, but Counsell to observe those wee are subject
to that is to say, the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of our severall Soveraigns:
Nor did he make any new Law to the Jews in his Sermon on the Mount, but onely
expounded the Laws of Moses, to which they were subject before. The Laws of God
therefore are none but the Laws of Nature, whereof the principall is, that we
should not violate our Faith, that is, a commandement to obey our Civill
Soveraigns, which wee constituted over us, by mutuall pact one with another. And
this Law of God, that commandeth Obedience to the Law Civill, commandeth by
consequence Obedience to all the Precepts of the Bible; which (as I have proved
in the precedent Chapter) is there onely Law, where the Civill Soveraign hath
made it so; and in other places but Counsell; which a man at his own perill, may
without injustice refuse to obey.

{#6} Knowing now what is the Obedience Necessary to Salvation, and to whom it is
due; we are to consider#_In the Faith of a Christian, who is the Person
beleeved._# next concerning Faith, whom, and why we beleeve; and what are the
Articles, or Points necessarily to be beleeved by them that shall be saved. And
first, for the Person whom we beleeve, because it is impossible to beleeve any
Person, before we know what he saith, it is necessary he be one that wee have
heard speak. The Person therefore, whom Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and the
Prophets beleeved, was God himself, that spake unto them supernaturally: And the
Person, whom the Apostles and Disciples that conversed with Christ beleeved, was
our Saviour himself. But of them, to whom neither God the Father, nor our
Saviour ever spake, it cannot be said, that the Person whom they beleeved, was
God. They beleeved the Apostles, and after them the Pastors and Doctors of the
Church, that recommended to their faith the History of the Old and New
Testament: so that the Faith of Christians ever since our Saviours time, hath
had for foundation, first, the reputation of their Pastors, and afterward, the
authority of those that made the Old and New Testament to be received for the
Rule of Faith; which none could do but Christian Soveraignes; who are therefore
the Supreme Pastors, and the onely Persons, whom Christians now hear speak from
God; except such as God speaketh to, in these days supernaturally. But because
there be many false Prophets _gone out into the world_, other men are to examine
such Spirits (as St. _John_ adviseth us, 1 Epistle, Chap. 4. ver. 1.) _whether
they be of God, or not_. And therefore, seeing the Examination of Doctrines
belongeth to the Supreme Pastor, the Person which all they that have no speciall
revelation are to beleeve, is (in every Common-wealth) the Supreme Pastor, that
is to say, the Civill Soveraigne.

{#7} #_The causes of Christian Faith._# The causes why men beleeve any Christian
Doctrine, are various: For Faith is the gift of God; and he worketh it in each
severall man, by such wayes, as it seemeth good unto himself. The most ordinary
immediate cause of our beleef, concerning any point of Christian Faith, is, that
wee beleeve the Bible to be the Word of God. But why wee beleeve the Bible to be
the Word of God, is much disputed, as all questions must needs bee, that are not
well stated. For they make not the question to be, _Why we Beleeve it_, but,
_How wee Know it_; as if _Beleeving_ and _Knowing_ were all one. And thence
while one side ground their Knowledge upon the Infallibility of the Church, and
the other side, on the Testimony of the Private Spirit, neither side concludeth
what it pretends. For how shall a man know the Infallibility of the Church, but
by knowing first the Infallibility of the Scripture? Or how shall a man know his
own Private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the Authority, and
Arguments of his Teachers; or upon a Presumption of his own Gifts? Besides,
there is nothing in the Scripture, from which can be inferred the Infallibility
of the Church: much lesse, of any particular Church; and least of all, the
Infallibility of any particular man.

{#8} It is manifest therefore, that Christian men doe not know, but onely
beleeve the Scripture to be the Word of#_Faith comes by Hearing._# God; and that
the means of making them beleeve which God is pleased to afford men ordinarily,
is according to the way of Nature, that is to say, from their Teachers. It is
the Doctrine of St. Paul concerning Christian Faith in generall, (_Rom_. 10.
17.) _Faith cometh by Hearing_, that is, by Hearing our lawfull Pastors. He
saith also (ver. 14, 15. of the same Chapter) _How shall they beleeve in him of
whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? and how
shall they Preach, except they be sent?_ Whereby it is evident, that the
ordinary cause of beleeving that the Scriptures are the Word of God, is the same
with the cause of the beleeving of all other Articles of our Faith, namely, the
Hearing of those that are by the Law allowed and appointed to Teach us, as our
Parents in their Houses, and our Pastors in the Churches: Which also is made
more manifest by experience. For what other cause can there bee assigned, why in
Christian Common-wealths all men either beleeve, or at least professe the
Scripture to bee the Word of God, and in other Common-wealths scarce any; but
that in Christian Common-wealths they are taught it from their infancy; and in
other places they are taught otherwise?

{#9} But if Teaching be the cause of Faith, why doe not all beleeve? It is
certain therefore that Faith is the gift of God, and hee giveth it to whom he
will. Neverthelesse, because to them to whom he giveth it, he giveth it by the
means of Teachers, the immediate cause of Faith is Hearing. In a School, where
many are taught, and some profit, others profit not, the cause of learning in
them that profit, is the Master; yet it cannot be thence inferred, that learning
is not the gift of God. All good things proceed from God; yet cannot all that
have them, say they are Inspired; for that implies a gift supernaturall, and the
immediate hand of God; which he that pretends to, pretends to be a Prophet, and
is subject to the examination of the Church.

{#10} But whether men _Know_, or _Beleeve_, or _Grant_ the Scriptures to be the
Word of God; if out of such places of them, as are without obscurity, I shall
shew what Articles of Faith are necessary, and onely necessary for Salvation,
those men must needs _Know, Beleeve_, or _Grant_ the same.

{#11} #_The onely Necessary Article of Christian Faith;_# The (_Unum
Necessarium_) Onely Article of Faith, which the Scripture maketh simply
Necessary to Salvation, is this, that ^Jesus is the^ ^Christ^. By the name of
_Christ_, is understood the King, which God had before promised by the Prophets
of the Old Testament, to send into the world, to reign (over the Jews, and over
such of other nations as should beleeve in him) under himself eternally; and to
give them that eternall life, which was lost by the sin of Adam. Which when I
have proved out of Scripture, I will further shew when, and in what sense some
other Articles may bee also called _Necessary_.

{#12} For Proof that the Beleef of this Article, _Jesus is the_#_Proved from the
Scope of the Evangelists:_# _Christ_, is all the Faith required to Salvation, my
first Argument shall bee from the Scope of the Evangelists; which was by the
description of the life of our Saviour, to establish that one Article, _Jesus is
the Christ_. The summe of St. Matthews Gospell is this, That Jesus was of the
stock of David; Born of a Virgin; which are the Marks of the true Christ: That
the _Magi_ came to worship him as King of the Jews: That Herod for the same
cause sought to kill him: That John Baptist proclaimed him: That he preached by
himselfe, and his Apostles that he was that King: That he taught the Law, not as
a Scribe, but as a man of Authority: That he cured diseases by his Word onely,
and did many other Miracles, which were foretold the Christ should doe: That he
was saluted King when hee entred into Jerusalem: That he fore-warned them to
beware of all others that should pretend to be Christ: That he was taken,
accused, and put to death, for saying, hee was King: That the cause of his
condemnation written on the Crosse, was ^Jesus of^ ^Nazareth, the^ ^King of the^
^Jewes^. All which tend to no other end than this, that men should beleeve, that
_Jesus is the Christ_. Such therefore was the Scope of St. Matthews Gospel. But
the Scope of all the Evangelists (as may appear by reading them) was the same.
Therefore the Scope of the whole Gospell, was the establishing of that onely
Article. And St. John expressely makes it his conclusion, _John_ 20. 31. _These
things are written, that you may know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the
living God_.

{#13} My second Argument is taken from the Subject of the#_From the Sermons of
the Apostles:_# Sermons of the Apostles, both whilest our Saviour lived on
earth, and after his Ascension. The Apostles in our Saviours time were sent,
_Luke_ 9. 2. to Preach the Kingdome of God: For neither there, nor _Mat_. 10. 7.
giveth he any Commission to them, other than this, _As ye go, Preach, saying,
the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand_; that is, that _Jesus_ is the _Messiah_, the
_Christ_, the _King_ which was to come. That their Preaching also after his
ascension was the same, is manifest out of _Acts_ 17. 6. _They drew_ (saith St.
Luke) _Jason and certain Brethren unto the Rulers of the City, crying, These
that have turned the world upside down are come hither also, whom Jason hath
received. And these all do contrary to the Decrees of C{oe}sar, saying, that
there is another King, one Jesus_: And out of the 2. & 3. verses of the same
Chapter, where it is said, that St. _Paul as his manner was, went in unto them;
and three Sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures; opening and
alledging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen againe from the dead,
and that this Jesus (whom hee preached) is Christ_.

{#14} The third Argument is, from those places of Scripture,#_From the easinesse
of the Doctrine:_# by which all the Faith required to Salvation is declared to
be Easie. For if an inward assent of the mind to all the Doctrines concerning
Christian Faith now taught, (whereof the greatest part are disputed,) were
necessary to Salvation, there would be nothing in the world so hard, as to be a
Christian. The Thief upon the Crosse though repenting, could not have been saved
for saying,_Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome_; by which he
testified no beleefe of any other Article, but this, That _Jesus was the King_.
Nor could it bee said (as it is _Mat_. 11. 30.) that _Christs yoke is Easy, and
his burthen Light_: Nor that _Little Children beleeve in him_, as it is _Matth_.
18. 6. Nor could St. Paul have said (1 _Cor_. 1. 21.) _It pleased God by the
Foolishnesse of preaching, to save them that beleeve_: Nor could St. Paul
himself have been saved, much lesse have been so great a Doctor of the Church so
suddenly, that never perhaps thought of Transubstantiation, nor Purgatory, nor
many other Articles now obtruded.

{#15} #_From formall and cleer texts._# The fourth Argument is taken from places
expresse, and such as receive no controversie of Interpretation; as first,
_John_ 5. 39. _Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall
life; and they are they that testifie of mee_. Our Saviour here speaketh of the
Scriptures onely of the Old Testament; for the Jews at that time could not
search the Scriptures of the New Testament, which were not written. But the Old
Testament hath nothing of Christ, but the Markes by which men might know him
when hee came; as that he should descend from David; be born at Bethlem, and of
a Virgin; doe great Miracles, and the like. Therefore to beleeve that this Jesus
was He, was sufficient to eternall life: but more than sufficient is not
Necessary; and consequently no other Article is required. Again, (_John_ 11.
26.) _Whosoever liveth and beleeveth in mee, shall not die eternally_, Therefore
to beleeve in Christ, is faith sufficient to eternall life; and consequently no
more faith than that is Necessary, But to beleeve in Jesus, and to beleeve that
Jesus is the Christ, is all one, as appeareth in the verses immediately
following. For when our Saviour (verse 26.) had said to Martha, _Beleevest thou
this?_ she answereth (verse 27.) _Yea Lord, I beleeve that thou art the Christ,
the Son of God, which should come into the world_: Therefore this Article alone
is faith sufficient to life eternall; and more than sufficient is not Necessary.
Thirdly, _John_ 20. 31. _These things are written that yee might beleeve, That
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that beleeving yee might have life
through his name_. There, to beleeve that _Jesus is the Christ_, is faith
sufficient to the obtaining of life; and therefore no other Article is
Necessary. Fourthly, 1 _John_ 4. 2. _Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh, is of God_. And 1 _Joh_. 5. 1. _Whosoever beleeveth
that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God_. And verse 5. _Who is hee that
overcommeth the world, but he that beleeveth that Jesus is the Son of God?_
Fiftly, _Act_. 8. ver. 36, 37. _See_ (saith the Eunuch) _here is water, what
doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou beleevest with all thy
heart thou mayst. And hee answered and said, I beleeve that Jesus Christ is the
Son of God_. Therefore this Article beleeved, _Jesus is the Christ_, is
sufficient to Baptisme, that is to say, to our Reception into the Kingdome of
God, and by consequence; onely Necessary. And generally in all places where our
Saviour saith to any man, _Thy faith hath saved thee_, the cause he saith it, is
some Confession, which directly, or by consequence, implyeth a beleef, that
_Jesus is the Christ_.

{#16} The last Argument is from the places, where this#_From that it is the
Foundation of all other Articles._# Article is made the Foundation of Faith: For
he that holdeth the Foundation shall bee saved. Which places are first, _Mat_.
24. 23. _If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ, or there, beleeve
it not, for there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew
great signes and wonders, &c_. Here wee see, this Article _Jesus is the Christ_,
must bee held, though hee that shall teach the contrary should doe great
miracles. The second place is, _Gal_. 1. 8. _Though we, or an Angell from Heaven
preach any other Gospell unto you, than that wee have preached unto you, let him
bee accursed_. But the Gospell which Paul, and the other Apostles, preached, was
onely this Article, that _Jesus is the Christ_: Therefore for the Beleef of this
Article, we are to reject the Authority of an Angell from heaven; much more of
any mortall man, if he teach the contrary. This is therefore the Fundamentall
Article of Christian Faith. A third place is, 1 _Joh_. 4. 1. _Beloved, beleeve
not every spirit. Hereby yee shall know the Spirit of God; every spirit that
confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God_. By which it is
evident, that this Article, is the measure, and rule, by which to estimate, and
examine all other Articles; and is therefore onely Fundamentall. A fourth is,
_Matt_. 16. 18. where after St. Peter had professed this Article, saying to our
Saviour, _Thou art Christ the Son of the living God_, Our Saviour answered,
_Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church_: from whence I
inferre, that this Article is that, on which all other Doctrines of the Church
are built, as on their Foundation. A fift is (1 _Cor_. 3. ver. 11, 12, &c.)
_Other Foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus is the Christ.
Now if any man build upon this Foundation, Gold, Silver, pretious Stones, Wood,
Hay, Stubble; Every mans work shall be made manifest; For the Day shall declare
it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every mans
work, of what sort it is. If any mans work abide, which he hath built thereupon,
he shall receive a reward: If any mans work shall bee burnt, he shall suffer
losse; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire_. Which words, being
partly plain and easie to understand, and partly allegoricall and difficult; out
of that which is plain, may be inferred, that Pastors that teach this
Foundation, that _Jesus is the Christ_, though they draw from it false
consequences, (which all men are sometimes subject to,) they may neverthelesse
bee saved; much more that they may bee saved, who being no Pastors, but Hearers,
beleeve that which is by their lawfull Pastors taught them. Therefore the beleef
of this Article is sufficient; and by consequence, there is no other Article of
Faith Necessarily required to Salvation.

{#17} Now for the part which is Allegoricall, as _That the fire shall try every
mans work_, and that _They shall be saved, but so as by fire_, or _through
fire_, (for the originall is διὰπνρὸς) it maketh nothing against this conclusion
which I have drawn from the other words, that are plain. Neverthelesse, because
upon this place there hath been an argument taken, to prove the fire of
Purgatory, I will also here offer you my conjecture concerning the meaning of
this triall of Doctrines, and saving of men as by Fire. The Apostle here seemeth
to allude to the words of the Prophet Zachary, Ch. 13. 8, 9. who speaking of the
Restauration of the Kingdome of God, saith thus, _Two parts therein shall be cut
off, and die, but the third shall be left therein; And I will bring the third
part through the Fire, and will refine them as Silver is refined, and will try
them as Gold is tryed; they shall call on the name of the Lord, and I will hear
them_. The day of Judgment, is the day of the Restauration of the Kingdome of
God; and at that day it is, that St. Peter tells us #_2 Pet. 3. v. 7, 10,
12._# shall be the Confiagration of the world, wherein the wicked shall perish;
but the remnant which God will save, shall passe through that Fire, unhurt, and
be therein (as Silver and Gold are refined by the fire from their drosse) tryed,
and refined from their Idolatry, and be made to call upon the name of the true
God. Alluding whereto St. Paul here saith, That _the Day_ (that is, the Day of
Judgment, the Great Day of our Saviours comming to restore the Kingdome of God
in Israel) shall try every mans doctrine, by Judging, which are Gold, Silver,
Pretious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble; And then they that have built false
Consequences on the true Foundation, shall see their Doctrines condemned;
neverthelesse they themselves shall be saved, and passe unhurt through this
universall Fire, and live eternally, to call upon the name of the true and onely
God. In which sense there is nothing that accordeth not with the rest of Holy
Scripture, or any glimpse of the fire of Purgatory.

{#18} But a man may here aske, whether it bee not as necessary#_In what sense
other Articles may be called Necessary._# to Salvation, to beleeve, that God is
Omnipotent; Creator of the world; that Jesus Christ is risen; and that all men
else shall rise again from the dead at the last day; as to beleeve, that _Jesus
is the Christ_. To which I answer, they are; and so are many more Articles: but
they are such, as are contained in this one, and may be deduced from it, with
more, or lesse difficulty. For who is there that does not see, that they who
beleeve Jesus to be the Son of the God of Israel, and that the Israelites had
for God the Omnipotent Creator of all things, doe therein also beleeve, that God
is the Omnipotent Creator of all things? Or how can a man beleeve, that Jesus is
the King that shall reign eternally, unlesse hee beleeve him also risen again
from the dead? For a dead man cannot exercise the Office of a King. In summe, he
that holdeth this Foundation, _Jesus is the Christ_, holdeth Expressely all that
hee seeth rightly deduced from it, and Implicitely all that is consequent
thereunto, though he have not skill enough to discern the consequence. And
therefore it holdeth still good, that the beleef of this one Article is
sufficient faith to obtaine remission of sinnes to the _Penitent_, and
consequently to bring them into the Kingdome of Heaven.

{#19} #_That Faith, and Obedience are both of them Necessary to Salvation._# Now
that I have shewn, that all the Obedience required to Salvation, consisteth in
the will to obey the Law of God, that is to say, in Repentance; and all the
Faith required to the same, is comprehended in the beleef of this Article _Jesus
is the Christ_; I will further alledge those places of the Gospell, that prove,
that all that is Necessary to Salvation is contained in both these joined
together. The men to whom St. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, next after
the Ascension of our Saviour, asked him, and the rest of the Apostles, saying,
(_Act_. 2. 37.) _Men and Brethren what shall we doe?_ To whom St. Peter answered
(in the next verse) _Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, for the remission
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost_. Therefore Repentance,
and Baptisme, that is, beleeving that _Jesus is the Christ_, is all that is
Necessary to Salvation. Again, our Saviour being asked by a certain Ruler,
(_Luke_ 18. 18.) _What shall I doe to inherite eternall life?_ Answered (verse
20.) _Thou knowest the Commandements, Doe not commit Adultery, Doe not Kill, Doe
not Steal, Doe not bear false witnesse, Honor thy Father, and thy Mother_: which
when he said he had observed, our Saviour added, _Sell all thou hast, give it to
the Poor, and come and follow me_: which was as much as to say, Relye on me that
am the King: Therefore to fulfill the Law, and to beleeve that Jesus is the
King, is all that is required to bring a man to eternall life. Thirdly, St. Paul
saith (_Rom_. 1. 17.) _The Just shall live by Faith_; not every one, but the
_Just_; therefore _Faith_ and _Justice_ (that is, the _will to be Just_, or
_Repentance_) are all that is Necessary to life eternall. And (_Mark_ 1. 15.)
our Saviour preached, saying, _The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is
at hand, Repent and Beleeve the Evangile_, that is, the Good news that the
Christ was come. Therefore to Repent, and to Beleeve that Jesus is the Christ,
is all that is required to Salvation.

{#20} #_What each of them contributes thereunto._# Seeing then it is Necessary
that Faith, and Obedience (implyed in the word Repentance) do both concurre to
our Salvation; the question by which of the two we are Justified, is
impertinently disputed. Neverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make
manifest in what manner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it
is said, that we are to be Justified by the one, and by the other. And first, if
by Righteousnesse be understood the Justice of the Works themselves, there is no
man that can be saved; for there is none that hath not transgressed the Law of
God. And therefore when wee are said to be Justified by Works, it is to be
understood of the Will, which God doth alwaies accept for the Work it selfe, as
well in good, as in evill men. And in this sense onely it is, that a man is
called _Just_, or _Unjust_; and that his Justice Justifies him, that is, gives
him the title, in Gods acceptation, of _Just_; and renders him capable of
_living by his Faith_, which before he was not. So that Justice Justifies in
that sense, in which to_Justifie_, is the same that to _Denominate a man Just_;
and not in the signification of discharging the Law; whereby the punishment of
his sins should be unjust.

{#21} But a man is then also said to be Justified, when his Plea, though in it
selfe unsufficient, is accepted; as when we Plead our Will, our Endeavour to
fulfill the Law, and Repent us of our failings, and God accepteth it for the
Performance it selfe: And because God accepteth not the Will for the Deed, but
onely in the Faithfull; it is therefore Faith that makes good our Plea; and in
this sense it is, that Faith onely Justifies: So that _Faith_ and _Obedience_
are both Necessary to Salvation; yet in severall senses each of them is said to
Justifie.

{#22} Having thus shewn what is Necessary to Salvation;#_Obedience to God and to
the Civill Soveraign not inconsistent, whether Christian,_# it is not hard to
reconcile our Obedience to God, with our Obedience to the Civill Soveraign; who
is either Christian, or Infidel. If he bee a Christian, he alloweth the beleefe
of this Article, that _Jesus is the Christ_; and of all the Articles that are
contained in, or are by evident consequence deduced from it: which is all the
Faith Necessary to Salvation. And because he is a Soveraign, he requireth
Obedience to all his owne, that is, to all the Civill Laws; in which also are
contained all the Laws of Nature, that is, all the Laws of God: for besides the
Laws of Nature, and the Laws of the Church, which are part of the Civill Law,
(for the Church that can make Laws is the Common-wealth,) there bee no other
Laws Divine. Whosoever therefore obeyeth his Christian Soveraign, is not thereby
hindred, neither from beleeving, nor from obeying God. But suppose that a
Christian King should from this Foundation _Jesus is the Christ_, draw some
false consequences, that is to say, make some superstructions of Hay, or
Stubble, and command the teaching of the same; yet seeing St. Paul says, he shal
be saved; much more shall he be saved, that teacheth them by his command; and
much more yet, he that teaches not, but onely beleeves his lawfull Teacher. And
in case a Subject be forbidden by the Civill Soveraign to professe some of those
his opinions, upon what just ground can he disobey? Christian Kings may erre in
deducing a Consequence, but who shall Judge? Shall a private man Judge, when the
question is of his own obedience? or shall any man Judg but he that is appointed
thereto by the Church, that is, by the Civill Soveraign that representeth it? or
if the Pope, or an Apostle Judge, may he not erre in deducing of a consequence?
did not one of the two, St. Peter, or St. Paul erre in a superstructure, when
St. Paul withstood St. Peter to his face? There can therefore be no
contradiction between the Laws of God, and the Laws of a Christian
Common-wealth.

{#23} #_Or Infidel._# And when the Civill Soveraign is an Infidel, every one of
his own Subjects that resisteth him, sinneth against the Laws of God (for such
as are the Laws of Nature,) and rejecteth the counsell of the Apostles, that
admonisheth all Christians to obey their Princes, and all Children and Servants
to obey their Parents, and Masters, in all things. And for their _Faith_, it is
internall, and invisible; They have the licence that Naaman had, and need not
put themselves into danger for it. But if they do, they ought to expect their
reward in Heaven, and not complain of their Lawfull Soveraign; much lesse make
warre upon him. For he that is not glad of any just occasion of Martyrdome, has
not the faith he professeth, but pretends it onely, to set some colour upon his
own contumacy. But what Infidel King is so unreasonable, as knowing he has a
Subject, that waiteth for the second comming of Christ, after the present world
shall bee burnt, and intendeth then to obey him (which is the intent of
beleeving that Jesus is the Christ,) and in the mean time thinketh himself bound
to obey the Laws of that Infidel King, (which all Christians are obliged in
conscience to doe,) to put to death, or to persecute such a Subject?

{#24} And thus much shall suffice, concerning the Kingdome of God, and Policy
Ecclesiasticall. Wherein I pretend not to advance any Position of my own, but
onely to shew what are the Consequences that seem to me deducible from the
Principles of Christian Politiques, (which are the holy Scriptures,) in
confirmation of the Power of Civill Soveraigns, and the Duty of their Subjects.
And in the allegation of Scripture, I have endeavoured to avoid such texts as
are of obscure, or controverted Interpretation; and to alledge none, but in such
sense as is most plain, and agreeable to the harmony and scope of the whole
Bible; which was written for the reestablishment of the Kingdome of God in
Christ. For it is not the bare Words, but the Scope of the writer that giveth
the true light, by which any writing is to bee interpreted; and they that insist
upon single Texts, without considering the main Designe, can derive no thing
from them cleerly; but rather by casting atomes of Scripture, as dust before
mens eyes, make every thing more obscure than it is; an ordinary artifice of
those that seek not the truth, but their own advantage.
