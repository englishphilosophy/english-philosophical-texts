£1 _Of the signification in Scripture of the word ^Church^._ £1

{#1} ^The^ word _Church, (Ecclesia_) signifieth in the Books#_Church the Lords
house._# of Holy Scripture divers things. Sometimes (though not often) it is
taken for _Gods House_, that is to say, for a Temple, wherein Christians
assemble to perform holy duties publiquely; as, I _Cor_. 14. ver. 34. _Let your
women keep silence in the Churches_: but this is Metaphorically put, for the
Congregation there assembled; and hath been since used for the Edifice it self,
to distinguish between the Temples of Christians, and Idolaters. The Temple of
Jerusalem was _Gods house_, and the House of Prayer; and so is any Edifice
dedicated by Christians to the worship of Christ, _Christs house_: and therefore
the Greek Fathers call it Κνριακὴ _The Lords house_; and thence, in our language
it came to be called _Kyrke_, and _Church_.

{#2} Church (when not taken for a House) signifieth the same that _Ecclesia_
signified in the Grecian Common-wealths;#_Ecclesia properly what._# that is to
say, a Congregation, or an Assembly of Citizens, called forth, to hear the
Magistrate speak unto them; and which in the Common-wealth of Rome was called
_Concio_, as he that spake was called _Ecclesiastes_, and _Concionator_. And
when they were called forth by lawfull Authority, it was _Ecclesia legitima, a_
_Lawfull_#_Acts 19. 39._# _Church_, έννομος But when they were excited by
tumultuous, and seditious clamor, then it was a confused Church, Εκκλησία
σνγκεχνμίνη.

{#3} It is taken also sometimes for the men that have right to be of the
Congregation, though not actually assembled; that is to say, for the whole
multitude of Christian men, how far soever they be dispersed: as (_Act_. 8. 3.)
where it is said, that _Saul made havock of the Church_: And in this sense is
_Christ_ said to be Head of the Church. And sometimes for a certain part of
Christians, as (_Col_. 4. 15.) _Salute the Church that is in his house_.
Sometimes also for the Elect onely; as (_Ephes_. 5. 27.) _A Glorious Church,
without spot, or wrinkle, holy, and without blemish_; which is meant of the
_Church triumphant_, or, _Church to come_. Sometimes, for a Congregation
assembled, of professors of Christianity, whether their profession be true, or
counterfeit, as it is understood, _Mat_. 18. 17. where it is said, _Tell it to
the Church, and if hee neglect to hear the Church, let him be to thee as a
Gentile, or Publican_.

{#4} #_In what sense the Church is one Person._# And in this last sense only it
is that the _Church_ can be taken for one Person; that is to say, that it can be
said to have power to will, to pronounce, to command, to be obeyed, to make
laws, or to doe any other action whatsoever; For without authority from a
lawfull Congregation, whatsoever act be done in a concourse of people, it is the
particular act of every one of those that were present, and gave their aid to
the performance of it; and not the act of them all in grosse, as of one body;
much lesse the act of them that were absent, or that being present, were not
willing it should be done. According#_Church defined._# o this sense, I define a
^Church^ to be, _A company of men professing Christian Religion, united in the
person of one Soveraign; at whose command they ought to assemble, and without
whose authority they ought not to assemble_. And because in all Common-wealths,
that Assembly, which is without warrant from the Civil Soveraign, is unlawful;
that Church also, which is assembled in any Common-wealth, that hath forbidden
them to assemble, is an unlawfull Assembly.

{#5} #_A Christian Common-wealth, and a Church all one._# It followeth also,
that there is on Earth, no such universall Church, as all Christians are bound
to obey; because there is no power on Earth, to which all other Common-wealths
are subject: There are Christians, in the Dominions of severall Princes and
States; but every one of them is subject to that Common-wealth, whereof he is
himself a member; and consequently, cannot be subject to the commands of any
other Person. And therefore a Church, such a one as is capable to Command, to
Judge, Absolve, Condemn, or do any other act, is the same thing with a Civil
Common-wealth, consisting of Christian men; and is called a _Civill State_, for
that the subjects of it are _Men_; and a _Church_, for that the subjects thereof
are _Christians. Temporall_ and _Spirituall_ Government, are but two words
brought into the world, to make men see double, and mistake their _Lawfull
Soveraign_. It is true, that the bodies of the faithfull, after the
Resurrection, shall be not onely Spirituall, but Eternall: but in this life they
are grosse, and corruptible. There is therefore no other Government in this
life, neither of State, nor Religion, but Temporall; nor teaching of any
doctrine, lawfull to any Subject, which the Governour both of the State, and of
the Religion, forbiddeth to be taught: And that Governor must be one; or else
there must needs follow Faction, and Civil war in the Common-wealth, between the
_Church_ and _State_; between _Spiritualists_, and _Temporalists_; between the
_Sword of Justice_, and the _Shield of Faith_; and (which is more) in every
Christian mans own brest, between the _Christian_, and the _Man_. The Doctors of
the Church, are called Pastors; so also are Civill Soveraignes: But if Pastors
be not subordinate one to another, so as that there may bee one chief Pastor,
men will be taught contrary Doctrines, whereof both may be, and one must be
false. Who that one chief Pastor is, according to the law of Nature, hath been
already shewn; namely, that it is the Civill Soveraign: And to whom the
Scripture hath assigned that Office, we shall see in the Chapters following.
