£1 _Of ^Power Ecclesiasticall^._ £1

{#1} ^For^ the understanding of ^Power^ ^Ecclesiasticall^, what, and in whom it
is, we are to distinguish the time from the Ascension of our Saviour, into two
parts; one before the Conversion of Kings, and men endued with Soveraign Civill
Power; the other after their Conversion. For it was long after the Ascension,
before any King, or Civill Soveraign embraced, and publiquely allowed the
teaching of Christian Religion.

{#2} #_Of the Holy Spirit that fel on the Apostles._# And for the time between,
it is manifest, that the _Power Ecclesiasticall_, was in the Apostles; and after
them in such as were by them ordained to Preach the Gospell, and to convert men
to Christianity, and to direct them that were converted in the way of Salvation;
and after these the Power was delivered again to others by these ordained, and
this was done by Imposition of hands upon such as were ordained; by which was
signified the giving of the Holy Spirit, or Spirit of God, to those whom they
ordained Ministers of God, to advance his Kingdome. So that Imposition of hands,
was nothing else but the Seal of their Commission to Preach Christ, and teach
his Doctrine; and the giving of the Holy Ghost by that ceremony of Imposition of
hands, was an imitation of that which Moses did. For Moses used the same
ceremony to his Minister Joshua, as wee read _Deuteronomy_ 34. ver. 9. _And
Joshua the Son of Nun was full of the Spirit of Wisdome; for Moses had laid his
hands upon him_. Our Saviour therefore between his Resurrection, and Ascension,
gave his Spirit to the Apostles; first, by _Breathing on them, and saying, (John
20. 22.) Receive yee the Holy Spirit_; and after his Ascension (_Acts_ 2. 2, 3.)
by sending down upon them, a _mighty wind, and Cloven tongues of fire_; and not
by Imposition of hands; as neither did God lay his hands on Moses: and his
Apostles afterward, transmitted the same Spirit by Imposition of hands, as Moses
did to Joshua. So that it is manifest hereby, in whom the Power Ecclesiasticall
continually remained, in those first times, where there was not any Christian
Common-wealth; namely, in them that received the same from the Apostles, by
successive laying on of hands.

{#3} #_Of the Trinity._# Here wee have the Person of God born now the third
time. For as Moses, and the High Priests, were Gods Representative in the Old
Testament; and our Saviour himselfe as Man, during his abode on earth: So the
Holy Ghost, that is to say, the Apostles, and their successors, in the Office of
Preaching, and Teaching, that had received the Holy Spirit, have Represented him
ever since. But a Person, (as I have shewn before, chapt. 13.) is he that is
Represented, as often as hee is Represented; and therefore God, who has been
Represented (that is, Personated) thrice, may properly enough be said to be
three Persons; though neither the word _Person_, nor _Trinity_ be ascribed to
him in the Bible. St. _John_ indeed (1 Epist. 5. 7.) saith, _There be three that
bear witnesse in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these
Three are One_: But this disagreeth not, but accordeth fitly with three Persons
in the proper signification of Persons; which is, that which is Represented by
another. For so God the Father, as Represented by Moses, is one Person; and as
Represented by his Sonne, another Person; and as Represented by the Apostles,
and by the Doctors that taught by authority from them derived, is a third
Person; and yet every Person here, is the Person of one and the same God. But a
man may here ask, what it was whereof these three bare witnesse. St. _John_
therefore tells us (verse II.) that they bear witnesse, that _God hath given us
eternall life in his Son_. Again, if it should bee asked, wherein that testimony
appeareth, the Answer is easie; for he hath testified the same by the miracles
he wrought, first by Moses; secondly, by his Son himself; and lastly by his
Apostles that had received the Holy Spirit; all which in their times Represented
the Person of God; and either prophecyed, or preached Jesus Christ. And as for
the Apostles, it was the character of the Apostleship, in the twelve first and
great Apostles, to bear Witnesse of his Resurrection; as appeareth expressely
(_Acts_ 1. ver. 21, 22.) where St. Peter, when a new Apostle was to be chosen in
the place of Judas Iscariot, useth these words, _Of these men which have
companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst us,
beginning at the Baptisme of John, unto that same day that hee was taken up from
us, must one bee ordained to be a Witnesse with us of his Resurrection_: which
words interpret the _bearing of Witnesse_, mentioned by St. John. There is in
the same place mentioned another Trinity of Witnesses in Earth. For (ver. 8.) he
saith, _there are three that bear Witnesse in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water,
and the Bloud; and these three agree in one_: that is to say, the graces of Gods
Spirit, and the two Sacraments, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, which all agree
in one Testimony, to assure the consciences of beleevers, of eternall life; of
which Testimony he saith (verse 10.) _He that beleeveth on the Son of man hath
the Witnesse in himself_. In this Trinity on Earth, the Unity is not of the
thing; for the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud, are not the same substance,
though they give the same testimony: But in the Trinity of Heaven, the Persons
are the persons of one and the same God, though Represented in three different
times and occasions. To conclude, the doctrine of the Trinity, as far as can be
gathered directly from the Scripture, is in substance this; that God who is
alwaies One and the same, was the Person Represented by Moses; the Person
Represented by his Son Incarnate; and the Person Represented by the Apostles. As
Represented by the Apostles, the Holy Spirit by which they spake, is God; As
Represented by his Son (that was God and Man), the Son is that God; As
represented by Moses, and the High Priests, the Father, that is to say, the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that God: From whence we may gather the
reason why those names _Father, Son_, and _Holy Spirit_ in the signification of
the Godhead, are never used in the Old Testament: For they are Persons, that is,
they have their names from Representing; which could not be, till divers men had
Represented Gods Person in ruling, or in directing under him.

{#4} Thus wee see how the Power Ecclesiasticall was left by our Saviour to the
Apostles; and how they were (to the end they might the better exercise that
Power,) endued with the Holy Spirit, which is therefore called sometime in the
New Testament _Paracletus_ which signifieth an _Assister_, or one called to for
helpe, though it bee commonly translated a _Comforter_. Let us now consider the
Power it selfe, what it was, and over whom.

{#5} #_The Power Ecclesiasticall is but the power to tonch._# Cardinall
Bellarmine in his third generall Controversie, hath handled a great many
questions concerning the Ecclesiasticall Power of the Pope of Rome; and begins
with this, Whether it ought to be Monarchicall, Aristocraticall, or
Democraticall. All which sorts of Power, are Soveraign, and Coercive. If now it
should appear, that there is no Coercive Power left them by our Saviour; but
onely a Power to proclaim the Kingdom of Christ, and to perswade men to submit
themselves thereunto; and by precepts and good counsell, to teach them that have
submitted, what they are to do, that they may be received into the Kingdom of
God when it comes; and that the Apostles, and other Ministers of the Gospel, are
our Schoolemasters, and not our Commanders, and their Precepts not Laws, but
wholesome Counsells; then were all that dispute in vain.

{#6} I have shewn already (in the last Chapter,) that the#_An argument thereof,
the Power of Christ himself:_# Kingdome of Christ is not of this world:
therefore neither can his Ministers (unless they be Kings,) require obedience in
his name. For if the Supreme King, have not his Regall Power in this world; by
what authority can obedience be required to his Officers? As my Father sent me,
(so saith our Saviour) I send you. But our Saviour was sent to perswade the Jews
to return to, and to invite the Gentiles, to receive the Kingdome of his Father,
and not to reign in Majesty, no not, as his Fathers Lieutenant, till the day of
Judgment.

{#7} The time between the Ascension, and the generall#_From the name of
Regeneration:_# Resurrection, is called, not a Reigning, but a Regeneration;
that is, a Preparation of men for the second and glorious coming of Christ, at
the day of Judgment; as appeareth by the words of our Saviour, _Mat_. 19. 28.
_You that have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in
the throne of his glory, you shall_ _also sit upon twelve Thrones_; And of St.
Paul (_Ephes_. 6. 15.) _Having your feet shod with the Preparation of the
Gospell of Peace_.

{#8} And is compared by our Saviour, to Fishing; that is,#_From the comparison
of it, with Fishing, Leaven, Seed._# to winning men to obedience, not by
Coercion, and Punishing; but by Perswasion: and therefore he said not to his
Apostles, hee would make them so many Nimrods, _Hunters of men; but Fishers of
men_. It is compared also to Leaven; to Sowing of Seed, and to the
Multiplication of a grain of Mustard-seed; by all which Compulsion is excluded;
and consequently there can in that time be no actual Reigning. The work of
Christs Ministers, is Evangelization; that is, a Proclamation of Christ, and a
preparation for his second comming; as the Evangelization of John Baptist, was a
preparation to his first coming.

{#9} #_From the nature of Faith:_# Again, the Office of Christs Ministers in
this world, is to make men Beleeve, and have Faith in Christ: But Faith hath no
relation to, nor dependence at all upon Compulsion, or Commandement; but onely
upon certainty, or probability of Arguments drawn from Reason, or from something
men beleeve already. Therefore the Ministers of Christ in this world, have no
Power by that title, to Punish any man for not Beleeving, or for Contradicting
what they say; they have I say no Power by that title of Christs Ministers, to
Punish such: but if they have Soveraign Civill Power, by politick institution,
then they may indeed lawfully Punish any Contradiction to their laws whatsoever:
And St. Paul, of himselfe and#_2 Cor. 1. 24._# ther the then Preachers of the
Gospell, saith in expresse words, _Wee have no Dominion over your Faith, but are
Helpers of your Joy_.

{#10} #_From the Authority Christ hath left to Civill Princes._# Another
Argument, that the Ministers of Christ in this present world have no right of
Commanding, may be drawn from the lawfull Authority which Christ hath left to
all Princes, as well Christians, as Infidels. St. Paul saith (_Col_. 3. 20.)
_Children obey your Parents in all things; for this is well pleasing to the
Lord_. And ver. 22. _Servants obey in all things your Masters according to the
flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart, as
fearing the Lord_: This is spoken to them whose Masters were Infidells; and yet
they are bidden to obey them _in all things_. And again, concerning obedience to
Princes. (_Rom_. 13. the first 6. verses) exhorting _to be subject to the Higher
Powers_, he saith, _that all Power is ordained of God_; and _that we ought to be
subject to them, not onely for_ fear of incurring their _wrath, but also for
conscience sake_. And St. _Peter_, (1 Epist. chap. 2. ver. 13, 14, 15.) _Submit
your selves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lords sake, whether it bee to the
King, as Supreme, or unto Governours, as to them that be sent by him for the
punishment of evill doers, and for the praise of them that doe well; for so is
the will of God_. And again St. Paul (_Tit_. 3. 1.) _Put men in mind to be
subject to Principalities, and Powers, and to obey Magistrates._ These Princes,
and Powers, whereof St. Peter, and St. Paul here speak, were all Infidels; much
more therefore we are to obey those Christians, whom God hath ordained to have
Soveraign Power over us. How then can wee be obliged to obey any Minister of
Christ, if he should command us to doe any thing contrary to the Command of the
King, or other Soveraign Representant of the Common-wealth, whereof we are
members, and by whom we look to be protected? It is therefore manifest, that
Christ hath not left to his Ministers in this world, unlesse they be also endued
with Civill Authority, any authority to Command other men.

{#11} But what (may some object) if a King, or#_What Christians may do to avoid
persecution._# a Senate, or other Soveraign Person forbid us to beleeve in
Christ? To this I answer, that such forbidding is of no effect; because Beleef,
and Unbeleef never follow mens Commands. Faith is a gift of God, which Man can
neither give, nor take away by promise of rewards, or menaces of torture. And if
it be further asked, What if wee bee commanded by our lawfull Prince, to say
with our tongue, wee beleeve not; must we obey such command? Profession with the
tongue is but an externall thing, and no more then any other gesture whereby we
signifie our obedience; and wherein a Christian, holding firmely in his heart
the Faith of Christ, hath the same liberty which the Prophet Elisha allowed to
Naaman the Syrian. Naaman was converted in his heart to the God of Israel; For
hee saith (2 _Kings_ 5. 17.) _Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt
offering, nor sacrifice unto other Gods but unto the Lord. In this thing the
Lord pardon thy servant, that when my Master goeth into the house of Rimmon to
worship there, and he leaneth on my hand; and I bow my selfe in the house of
Rimmon; when I bow my selfe in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant
in this thing_. This the Prophet approved, and bid him _Goe in peace_. Here
Naaman beleeved in his heart; but by bowing before the Idol Rimmon, he denyed
the true God in effect, as much as if he had done it with his lips. But then
what shall we answer to our Saviours saying, _Whosoever denyeth me before men, I
will deny him before my Father which is in Heaven?_ This we may say, that
whatsoever a subject, as Naaman was, is compelled to in obedience to his
Soveraign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of
his country, that action is not his, but his Soveraigns; nor is it he that in
this case denyeth Christ before men, but his Governour, and the law of his
countrey. If any man shall accuse this doctrine, as repugnant to true, and
unfeigned Christianity; I ask him, in case there should be a subject in any
Christian Common-wealth, that should be inwardly in his heart of the Mahometan
Religion, whether if his Soveraign command him to bee present at the divine
service of the Christian Church, and that on pain of death, he think that
Mahometan obliged in conscience to suffer death for that cause, rather than to
obey that command of his lawfull Prince. If he say, he ought rather to suffer
death, then he authorizeth all private men, to disobey their Princes, in
maintenance of their Religion, true, or false: if he say, he ought to bee
obedient, then he alloweth to himself, that which hee denyeth to another,
contrary to the words of our Saviour, _Whatsoever you would that men should doe
unto you, that doe yee unto them_; and contrary to the Law of Nature, (which is
the indubitable everlasting Law of God) _Do not to another, that which thou
wouldest not he should doe unto thee_.

{#12} #_Of Martyrs._# But what then shall we say of all those Martyrs we read of
in the History of the Church, that they have needlessely cast away their lives?
For answer hereunto, we are to distinguish the persons that have been for that
cause put to death; whereof some have received a Calling to preach, and professe
the Kingdome of Christ openly; others have had no such Calling, nor more has
been required of them than their owne faith. The former sort, if they have been
put to death, for bearing witnesse to this point, that Jesus Christ is risen
from the dead, were true Martyrs; For a _Martyr_ is, (to give the true
definition of the word) a Witnesse of the Resurrection of Jesus the Messiah;
which none can be but those that conversed with him on earth, and saw him after
he was risen: For a Witnesse must have seen what he testifieth, or else his
testimony is not good. And that none but such, can properly be called Martyrs of
Christ, is manifest out of the words of St. Peter, _Act_. 1. 21, 22. _Wherefore
of these men which have companyed with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went
in and out amongst us, beginning from the Baptisme of John unto that same day
hee was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a Martyr_ (that is a
Witnesse) _with us of his Resurrection_: Where we may observe, that he which is
to bee a Witnesse of the truth of the Resurrection of Christ, that is to say, of
the truth of this fundamentall article of Christian Religion, that Jesus was the
Christ, must be some Disciple that conversed with him, and saw him before, and
after his Resurrection; and consequently must be one of his originall Disciples:
whereas they which were not so, can Witnesse no more, but that their antecessors
said it, and are therefore but Witnesses of other mens testimony; and are but
second Martyrs, or Martyrs of Christs Witnesses.

{#13} He, that to maintain every doctrine which he himself draweth out of the
History of our Saviours life, and of the Acts, or Epistles of the Apostles; or
which he beleeveth upon the authority of a private man, wil oppose the Laws and
Authority of the Civill State, is very far from being a Martyr of Christ, or a
Martyr of his Martyrs. 'Tis one Article onely, which to die for, meriteth so
honorable a name; and that Article is this, that _Jesus is the Christ_; that is
to say, He that hath redeemed us, and shall come again to give us salvation, and
eternall life in his glorious Kingdome. To die for every tenet that serveth the
ambition, or profit of the Clergy, is not required; nor is it the Death of the
Witnesse, but the Testimony it self that makes the Martyr: for the word
signifieth nothing else, but the man that beareth Witnesse, whether he be put to
death for his testimony, or not.

{#14} Also he that is not sent to preach this fundamentall article, but taketh
it upon him of his private authority, though he be a Witnesse, and consequently
a Martyr, either primary of Christ, or secundary of his Apostles, Disciples, or
their Successors; yet is he not obliged to suffer death for that cause; because
being not called thereto, tis not required at his hands; nor ought hee to
complain, if he loseth the reward he expecteth from those that never set him on
work. None therefore can be a Martyr, neither of the first, nor second degree,
that have not a warrant to preach Christ come in the flesh; that is to say,
none, but such as are sent to the conversion of Infidels. For no man is a
Witnesse to him that already beleeveth, and therefore needs no Witnesse; but to
them that deny, or doubt, or have not heard it. Christ sent his Apostles, and
his Seventy Disciples, with authority to preach; he sent not all that beleeved:
And he sent them to unbeleevers; _I send you_ (saith he) _as sheep amongst
wolves_; not as sheep to other sheep.

{#15} #_Argument from the points of their Commission._# Lastly, the points of
their Commission, as they are expressely set down in the Gospel, contain none of
them any authority over the Congregation.

{#16} #_To Preach._# We have first (_Mat_. 10.) that the twelve Apostles were
sent _to the lost sheep of the house of Israel_, and commanded to Preach, _that
the Kingdome of God was at hand_. Now Preaching in the originall, is that act,
which a Crier, Herald, or other Officer useth to doe publiquely in Proclaiming
of a King. But a Crier hath not right to Command any man. And (_Luke_ 10. 2.)
the seventy Disciples are sent out, as _Labourers, not as Lords of the Harvest_;
and are bidden (verse 9.) to say, _The Kingdome of God is come nigh unto you_;
and by Kingdom here is meant, not the Kingdome of Grace, but the Kingdome of
Glory; for they are bidden to denounce it (ver. 11.) to those Cities which shall
not receive them, as a threatning, that it shall be more tolerable in that day
for _Sodome_, than for such a City. And (_Mat_. 20. 28.) our Saviour telleth his
Disciples, that sought Priority of place, their Office was to minister, even as
the Son of man came, not to be ministred unto, but to minister. Preachers
therefore have not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall power: _Bee not called
Masters_, (saith our Saviour, _Mat_. 23. 10.) _for one is your Master, even
Christ_.

{#17} #_And Teach._# Another point of their Commission, is, to _Teach all
nations_; as it is in _Mat_. 28. 19. or as in St. _Mark_ 16. 15. _Goe into all
the world, and Preach the Gospel to every creature._ Teaching therefore, and
Preaching is the same thing. For they that Proclaim the comming of a King, must
withall make known by what right he commeth, if they mean men shall submit
themselves unto him: As St. Paul did to the Jews of Thessalonica, when _three
Sabbath dayes he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening, and
alledging that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead,
and that this Jesus is Christ_. But to teach out of the Old Testament that Jesus
was Christ, (that is to say, King,) and risen from the dead, is not to say, that
men are bound after they beleeve it, to obey those that tell them so, against
the laws, and commands of their Soveraigns; but that they shall doe wisely, to
expect the coming of Christ hereafter, in Patience, and Faith, with Obedience to
their present Magistrates.

{#18} Another point of their Commission, is to _Baptize, in_#_To Baptize:_# _the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost_. What is Baptisme?
Dipping into water. But what is it to Dip a man into the water in the name of
any thing? The meaning of these words of Baptisme is this. He that is Baptized,
is Dipped or Washed, as a sign of becomming a new man, and a loyall subject to
that God, whose Person was represented in old time by Moses, and the High
Priests, when he reigned over the Jews; and to Jesus Christ, his Sonne, God, and
Man, that hath redeemed us, and shall in his humane nature Represent his Fathers
Person in his eternall Kingdome after the Resurrection; and to acknowledge the
Doctrine of the Apostles, who assisted by the Spirit of the Father, and of the
Son, were left for guides to bring us into that Kingdome, to be the onely, and
assured way thereunto. This, being our promise in Baptisme; and the Authority of
Earthly Soveraigns being not to be put down till the day of Judgment; (for that
is expressely affirmed by S. Paul 1 _Cor_. 15, 22, 23, 24, where he saith, _As
in Adam all die, so in Christ all shall be made alive. But every man in his owne
order, Christ the first fruits, afterward they that are Christs, at his comming;
Then commeth the end, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even
the Father, when he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power_)
it is manifest, that we do not in Baptisme constitute over us another authority,
by which our externall actions are to bee governed in this life; but promise to
take the doctrine of the Apostles for our direction in the way to life eternall.

{#19} #_And to Forgive, and Retain Sinnes._# The Power of _Remission, and
Retention of Sinnes_, called also the Power of _Loosing_, and _Binding_, and
sometimes the _Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven_, is a consequence of the
Authority to Baptize, or refuse to Baptize. For Baptisme is the Sacrament of
Allegeance, of them that are to be received into the Kingdome of God; that is to
say, into Eternall life; that is to say, to Remission of Sin: For as Eternall
life was lost by the Committing, so it is recovered by the Remitting of mens
Sins. The end of Baptisme is Remission of Sins: and therefore St. Peter, when
they that were converted by his Sermon on the day of Pentecost, asked what they
were to doe, advised them to _repent, and be Baptized in the name of Jesus, for
the Remission of Sins_. And therefore seeing to Baptize is to declare the
Reception of men into Gods Kingdome; and to refuse to Baptize is to declare
their Exclusion; it followeth, that the Power to declare them Cast out, or
Retained in it, was given to the same Apostles, and their Substitutes, and
Successors. And therefore after our Saviour had breathed upon them, saying,
(_John_ 20. 22.) _Receive the Holy Ghost_, hee addeth in the next verse, _Whose
soever Sins ye Remit, they are Remitted unto them; and whose soever Sins ye
Retain, they are Retained_. By which words, is not granted an Authority to
Forgive, or Retain Sins, simply and absolutely, as God Forgiveth or Retaineth
them, who knoweth the Heart of man, and truth of his Penitence and Conversion;
but conditionally, to the Penitent: And this Forgivenesse, or Absolution, in
case the absolved have but a feigned Repentance, is thereby without other act,
or sentence of the Absolvent, made void, and hath no effect at all to Salvation,
but on the contrary, to the Aggravation of his Sin. Therefore the Apostles, and
their Successors, are to follow but the outward marks of Repentance; which
appearing, they have no Authority to deny Absolution; and if they appeare not,
they have no authority to Absolve. The same also is to be observed in Baptisme:
for to a converted Jew, or Gentile, the Apostles had not the Power to deny
Baptisme; nor to grant it to the Un-penitent. But seeing no man is able to
discern the truth of another mans Repentance, further than by externall marks,
taken from his words, and actions, which are subject to hypocrisie; another
question will arise, Who it is that is constituted Judge of those marks. And
this question is decided by our Saviour himself; _If thy Brother_ (saith he)
_shal trespasse_#_Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17._# _against thee, go and tell him his
fault between thee, and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
Brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one, or two more. And
if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to
hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican_. By
which it is manifest, that the Judgment concerning the truth of Repentance,
belonged not to any one Man, but to the Church, that is, to the Assembly of the
Faithfull, or to them that have authority to bee their Representant. But besides
the Judgment, there is necessary also the pronouncing of Sentence: And this
belonged alwaies to the Apostle, or some Pastor of the Church, as Prolocutor;
and of this our Saviour speaketh in the 18 verse, _Whatsoever ye shall bind on
earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall
be loosed in heaven_. And conformable hereunto was the practise of St. Paul (1
_Cor_. 5. 3, 4, & 5.) where he saith, _For I verily, as absent in body, but
present in spirit, have determined already, as though I were present, concerning
him that hath so done this deed; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye
are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
To deliver such a one to Satan;_ that is to say, to cast him out of the Church,
as a man whose Sins are not Forgiven. Paul here pronounceth the Sentence; but
the Assembly was first to hear the Cause, (for St. Paul was absent;) and by
consequence to condemn him. But in the same chapter (ver. 11, 12.) the Judgment
in such a case is more expressely attributed to the Assembly: _But now I have
written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a Brother be a
Fornicator, &c. with such a one no not to eat. For what have I to do to judg
them that are without? Do not ye judg them that are within?_ The Sentence
therefore by which a man was put out of the Church, was pronounced by the
Apostle, or Pastor; but the Judgment concerning the merit of the cause, was in
the Church; that is to say, (as the times were before the conversion of Kings,
and men that had Soveraign Authority in the Common-wealth,) the Assembly of the
Christians dwelling in the same City; as in Corinth, in the Assembly of the
Christians of Corinth.

{#20} #_Of Excommunication._# This part of the Power of the Keyes, by which men
were thrust out from the Kingdom of God, is that which is called
_Excommunication_; and to _excommunicate_, is in the Originall, ᾀποσννάγωγον
ποιι̑ν _to cast out of the Synagogue_; that is, out of the place of Divine
service; a word drawn from the custome of the Jews, to cast out of their
Synagogues, such as they thought in manners, or doctrine, contagious, as Lepers
were by the Law of Moses separated from the congregation of Israel, till such
time as they should be by the Priest pronounced clean.

{#21} #_The use of Excommunication without Civill Power,_# The Use and Effect of
Excommunication, whilest it was not yet strengthened with the Civill Power, was
no more, than that they, who were not Excommunicate, were to avoid the company
of them that were. It was not enough to repute them as Heathen, that never had
been Christians; for with such they might eate, and drink; which with
Excommunicate persons they might not do; as appeareth by the words of St. Paul,
(1 _Cor_. 5. ver. 9, 10, &c.) where he telleth them, he had formerly forbidden
them to _company with Fornicators_; but (because that could not bee without
going out of the world,) he restrained it to such Fornicators, and otherwise
vicious persons, as were of the brethren; _with such a one_ (he saith) they
ought not to keep company, _no not to eat_. And this is no more than our Saviour
saith (_Mat_. 18. 17.) _Let him be to thee as a Heathen, and as a Publican_. For
Publicans (which signifieth Farmers, and Receivers of the revenue of the
Common-wealth) were so hated, and detested by the Jews that were to pay it, as
that _Publican_ and _Sinner_ were taken amongst them for the same thing:
Insomuch, as when our Saviour accepted the invitation of _Zacch{oe}us_ a
Publican; though it were to Convert him, yet it was objected to him as a Crime.
And therefore, when our Saviour, to _Heathen_, added _Publican_, he did forbid
them to eat with a man Excommunicate.

{#22} As for keeping them out of their Synagogues, or places of Assembly, they
had no Power to do it, but that of the owner of the place, whether he were
Christian, or Heathen. And because all places are by right, in the Dominion of
the Common-wealth; as well hee that was Excommunicated, as hee that never was
Baptized, might enter into them by Commission from the Civill Magistrate; as
Paul#_Acts 9. 2._# before his conversion entred into their Synagogues at
Damascus, to apprehend Christians, men and women, and to carry them bound to
Jerusalem, by Commission from the High Priest.

{#23} By which it appears, that upon a Christian, that#_Of no effect upon an
Apostate._# should become an Apostate, in a place where the Civill Power did
persecute, or not assist the Church, the effect of Excommunication had nothing
in it, neither of dammage in this world, nor of terrour: Not of terrour, because
of their unbeleef; nor of dammage, because they returned thereby into the favour
of the world; and in the world to come, were to be in no worse estate, then they
which never had beleeved. The dammage redounded rather to the Church, by
provocation of them they cast out, to a freer execution of their malice.

{#24} Excommunication therefore had its effect onely upon#_But upon the
faithfull only._# those, that beleeved that Jesus Christ was to come again in
Glory, to reign over, and to judge both the quick, and the dead, and should
therefore refuse entrance into his Kingdom, to those whose Sins were Retained;
that is, to those that were Excommunicated by the Church. And thence it is that
St. Paul calleth Excommunication, a delivery of the Excommunicate person to
Satan. For without the Kingdom of Christ, all other Kingdomes after Judgment,
are comprehended in the Kingdome of Satan. This is it that the faithfull stood
in fear of, as long as they stood Excommunicate, that is to say, in an estate
wherein their sins were not Forgiven. Whereby wee may understand, that
Excommunication in the time that Christian Religion was not authorized by the
Civill Power, was used onely for a correction of manners, not of errours in
opinion: for it is a punishment, whereof none could be sensible but such as
beleeved, and expected the coming again of our Saviour to judge the world; and
they who so beleeved, needed no other opinion, but onely uprightnesse of life,
to be saved.

{#25} #_For what fault lyeth Excommunication._# There lyeth Excommunication for
Injustice; as (_Mat_. 18.) If thy Brother offend thee, tell it him privately;
then with Witnesses; lastly, tell the Church; and then if he obey not, _Let him
be to thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican_. And there lieth Excommunication
for a Scandalous Life, as (1 _Cor_. 5. 11.) _If any man that is called a
Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Drunkard, or an
Extortioner, with such a one yee are not to eat_. But to Excommunicate a man
that held this foundation, that _Jesus was the Christ_, for difference of
opinion in other points, by which that Foundation was not destroyed, there
appeareth no authority in the Scripture, nor example in the Apostles. There is
indeed in St. Paul (_Titus_ 3. 10.) a text that seemeth to be to the contrary.
_A man that is an H{oe}retique, after the first and second admonition, reject_.
For an _H{oe}retique_, is he, that being a member of the Church, teacheth
neverthelesse some private opinion, which the Church has forbidden: and such a
one, S. Paul adviseth _Titus_, after the first, and second admonition, to
_Reject_. But to _Reject_ (in this place) is not to Excommunicate the Man; But
to _give over admonishing him, to let him alone, to set by disputing with him_,
as one that is to be convinced onely by himselfe. The same Apostle saith (2
_Tim_. 2. 23.) _Foolish and unlearned questions avoid_: The word _Avoid_ in this
place, and _Reject_ in the former, is the same in the Originall, παραιτο: but
Foolish questions may bee set by without Excommunication. And again, (_Tit_. 3.
9.) _Avoid Foolish questions_, where the Originall περιίστασο, (_set them by_)
is equivalent to the former word _Reject_. There is no other place that can so
much as colourably be drawn, to countenance the Casting out of the Church
faithfull men, such as beleeved the foundation, onely for a singular
superstructure of their own, proceeding perhaps from a good & pious conscience.
But on the contrary, all such places as command avoiding such disputes, are
written for a Lesson to Pastors, (such as Timothy and Titus were) not to make
new Articles of Faith, by determining every small controversie, which oblige men
to a needlesse burthen of Conscience, or provoke them to break the union of the
Church. Which Lesson the Apostles themselves observed well. S. Peter, and S.
Paul, though their controversie were great, (as we may read in _Gal_. 2. 11.)
yet they did not cast one another out of the Church. Neverthelesse, during the
Apostles times, there were other Pastors that observed it not; As Diotrephes (3
_John_ 9. &c.) who cast out of the Church, such as S. John himself thought fit
to be received into it, out of a pride he took in Pr{ae}eminence; so early it
was, that Vain-glory, and Ambition had found entrance into the Church of Christ.

{#26} That a man be liable to Excommunication, there be#_Of persons liable to
Excommunication._# many conditions requisite; as First, that he be a member of
some Commonalty, that is to say, of some lawfull Assembly, that is to say, of
some Christian Church, that hath power to judge of the cause for which hee is to
bee Excommunicated. For where there is no Community, there can bee no
Excommunication; nor where there is no power to Judge, can there bee any power
to give Sentence.

{#27} From hence it followeth, that one Church cannot be Excommunicated by
another: For either they have equall power to Excommunicate each other, in which
case Excommunication is not Discipline, nor an act of Authority, but Schisme,
and Dissolution of charity; or one is so subordinate to the other, as that they
both have but one voice, and then they be but one Church; and the part
Excommunicated, is no more a Church, but a dissolute number of individuall
persons.

{#28} And because the sentence of Excommunication, importeth an advice, not to
keep company, nor so much as to eat with him that is Excommunicate, if a
Soveraign Prince, or Assembly bee Excommunicate, the sentence is of no effect.
For all Subjects are bound to be in the company and presence of their own
Soveraign (when he requireth it) by the law of Nature; nor can they lawfully
either expell him from any place of his own Dominion, whether profane or holy;
nor go out of his Dominion, without his leave; much lesse (if he call them to
that honour,) refuse to eat with him. And as to other Princes and States,
because they are not parts of one and the same congregation, they need not any
other sentence to keep them from keeping company with the State Excommunicate:
for the very Institution, as it uniteth many men into one Community; so it
dissociateth one Community from another: so that Excommunication is not needfull
for keeping Kings and States asunder; nor has any further effect then is in the
nature of Policy it selfe; unlesse it be to instigate Princes to warre upon one
another.

{#29} Nor is the Excommunication of a Christian Subject, that obeyeth the laws
of his own Soveraign, whether Christian, or Heathen, of any effect. For if he
beleeve that _Jesus is the Christ, he hath the Spirit of God_, (1 Joh. 4. 1.)
_and God dwelleth in him, and he in God_, (1 Joh. 4. 15.) But hee that hath the
Spirit of God; hee that dwelleth in God; hee in whom God dwelleth, can receive
no harm by the Excommunication of men. Therefore, he that beleeveth Jesus to be
the Christ, is free from all the dangers threatned to persons Excommunicate. He
that beleeveth it not, is no Christian. Therefore a true and unfeigned Christian
is not liable to Excommunication: Nor he also that is a professed Christian,
till his Hypocrisy appear in his Manners, that is, till his behaviour bee
contrary to the law of his Soveraign, which is the rule of Manners, and which
Christ and his Apostles have commanded us to be subject to. For the Church
cannot judge of Manners but by externall Actions, which Actions can never bee
unlawfull, but when they are against the Law of the Common-wealth.

{#30} If a mans Father, or Mother, or Master bee Excommunicate, yet are not the
Children forbidden to keep them Company, nor to Eat with them; for that were
(for the most part) to oblige them not to eat at all, for want of means to get
food; and to authorise them to disobey their Parents, and Masters, contrary to
the Precept of the Apostles.

{#31} In summe, the Power of Excommunication cannot be extended further than to
the end for which the Apostles and Pastors of the Church have their Commission
from our Saviour; which is not to rule by Command and Coaction, but by Teaching
and Direction of men in the way of Salvation in the world to come. And as a
Master in any Science, may abandon his Scholar, when hee obstinately neglecteth
the practise of his rules; but not accuse him of Injustice, because he was never
bound to obey him: so a Teacher of Christian doctrine may abandon his Disciples
that obstinately continue in an unchristian life; but he cannot say, they doe
him wrong, because they are not obliged to obey him: For to a Teacher that shall
so complain, may be applyed the Answer of God to Samuel in the like place, _They
have_#_1 Sam. 8._# _not rejected thee, but mee_. Excommunication therefore when
it wanteth the assistance of the Civill Power, as it doth, when a Christian
State, or Prince is Excommunicate by a forain Authority, is without effect; and
consequently ought to be without terrour. The name of _Fulmen Excommunicationis_
(that is, _the Thunderbolt of Excommunication_) proceeded from an imagination of
the Bishop of Rome, which first used it, that he was King of Kings, as the
Heathen made Jupiter King of the Gods; and assigned him in their Poems, and
Pictures, a Thunderbolt, wherewith to subdue, and punish the Giants, that should
dare to deny his power: Which imagination was grounded on two errours; one, that
the Kingdome of Christ is of this world, contrary to our Saviours owne words,
_My Kingdome is not of this world_; the other, that hee is Christs Vicar, not
onely over his owne Subjects, but over all the Christians of the World; whereof
there is no ground in Scripture, and the contrary shall bee proved in its due
place.

{#32} _St. Paul_ coming to _Thessalonica_, where was a Synagogue#_Of the
Interpreter of the Scriptures before Civil Soveraigns became Christians._# of
the Jews, (_Acts_ 17. 2, 3.) _As his manner was, went in unto them, and three
Sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, Opening and alledging,
that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead_; and that
this Jesus whom he preached was the Christ. The Scriptures here mentioned were
the Scriptures of the Jews, that is, the Old Testament. The men, to whom he was
to prove that Jesus was the Christ, and risen again from the dead, were also
Jews, and did beleeve already, that they were the Word of God. Hereupon (as it
is verse 4.) some of them beleeved, and (as it is in the 5. ver.) some beleeved
not. What was the reason, when they all beleeved the Scripture, that they did
not all beleeve alike; but that some approved, others disapproved the
Interpretation of St. Paul that cited them; and every one Interpreted them to
himself? It was this; S. Paul came to them without any Legall Commission, and in
the manner of one that would not Command, but Perswade; which he must needs do,
either by Miracles, as Moses did to the Israelites in Egypt, that they might see
his Authority in Gods works; or by Reasoning from the already received
Scripture, that they might see the truth of his doctrine in Gods Word. But
whosoever perswadeth by reasoning from principles written, maketh him to whom
hee speaketh Judge, both of the meaning of those principles, and also of the
force of his inferences upon them. If these Jews of Thessalonica were not, who
else was the Judge of what S. Paul alledged out of Scripture? If S. Paul, what
needed he to quote any places to prove his doctrine? It had been enough to have
said, I find it so in Scripture, that is to say, in your Laws, of which I am
Interpreter, as sent by Christ. The Interpreter therefore of the Scripture, to
whose Interpretation the Jews of Thessalonica were bound to stand, could be
none: every one might beleeve, or not beleeve, according as the Allegations
seemed to himselfe to be agreeable, or not agreeable to the meaning of the
places alledged. And generally in all cases of the world, hee that pretendeth
any proofe, maketh Judge of his proofe him to whom he addresseth his speech. And
as to the case of the Jews in particular, they were bound by expresse words
(_Deut_. 17.) to receive the determination of all hard questions, from the
Priests and Judges of Israel for the time being. But this is to bee understood
of the Jews that were yet unconverted.

{#33} For the conversion of the Gentiles, there was no use of alledging the
Scriptures, which they beleeved not. The Apostles therefore laboured by Reason
to confute their Idolatry; and that done, to perswade them to the faith of
Christ, by their testimony of his Life, and Resurrection. So that there could
not yet bee any controversie concerning the authority to Interpret Scripture;
seeing no man was obliged during his infidelity, to follow any mans
Interpretation of any Scripture, except his Soveraigns Interpretation of the Law
of his countrey.

{#34} Let us now consider the Conversion it self, and see what there was
therein, that could be cause of such an obligation. Men were converted to no
other thing then to the Beleef of that which the Apostles preached: And the
Apostles preached nothing, but that Jesus was the Christ, that is to say, the
King that was to save them, and reign over them eternally in the world to come;
and consequently that hee was not dead, but risen again from the dead, and gone
up into Heaven, and should come again one day to judg the world, (which also
should rise again to be judged,) and reward every man according to his works.
None of them preached that himselfe, or any other Apostle was such an
Interpreter of the Scripture, as all that became Christians, ought to take their
Interpretation for Law. For to Interpret the Laws, is part of the Administration
of a present Kingdome; which the Apostles had not. They prayed then, and all
other Pastors ever since, _Let thy Kingdome come_; and exhorted their Converts
to obey their then Ethnique Princes. The New Testament was not yet published in
one Body. Every of the Evangelists was Interpreter of his own Gospel; and every
Apostle of his own Epistle; And of the Old Testament, our Saviour himselfe saith
to the Jews (_John_ 5. 39.) _Search the Scriptures; for in them yee thinke to
have eternall life, and they are they that testifie of me_. If hee had not meant
they should Interpret them, hee would not have bidden them take thence the proof
of his being the Christ: he would either have Interpreted them himselfe, or
referred them to the Interpretation of the Priests.

{#35} When a difficulty arose, the Apostles and Elders of the Church assembled
themselves together, and determined what should bee preached, and taught, and
how they should Interpret the Scriptures to the People; but took not from the
People the liberty to read, and Interpret them to themselves. The Apostles sent
divers Letters to the Churches, and other Writings for their instruction; which
had been in vain, if they had not allowed them to Interpret, that is, to
consider the meaning of them. And as it was in the Apostles time, it must be
till such time as there should be Pastors, that could authorise an Interpreter,
whose Interpretation should generally be stood to: But that could not be till
Kings were Pastors, or Pastors Kings.

{#36} #_Of the Power to make Scripture Law._# There be two senses, wherein a
Writing may be said to be _Canonicall_; for _Canon_, signifieth a _Rule_; and a
Rule is a Precept, by which a man is guided, and directed in any action
whatsoever. Such Precepts, though given by a Teacher to his Disciple, or a
Counsellor to his friend, without power to Compell him to observe them, are
neverthelesse Canons; because they are Rules: But when they are given by one,
whom he that receiveth them is bound to obey, then are those Canons, not onely
Rules, but Laws: The question therefore here, is of the Power to make the
Scriptures (which are the Rules of Christian Faith) Laws.

{#37} #_Of the Ten Commandements._# That part of the Scripture, which was first
Law, was the Ten Commandements, written in two Tables of Stone, and delivered by
God himselfe to Moses; and by Moses made known to the people. Before that time
there was no written Law of God, who as yet having not chosen any people to bee
his peculiar Kingdome, had given no Law to men, but the Law of Nature, that is
to say, the Precepts of Naturall Reason, written in every mans own heart. Of
these two Tables, the first containeth the law of Soveraignty; 1. That they
should not obey, nor honour the Gods of other Nations, in these words, _Non
habebis Deos alienos coram me_, that is, _Thou shalt not have for Gods, the Gods
that other Nations worship; but onely me_: whereby they were forbidden to obey,
or honor, as their King and Governour, any other God, than him that spake unto
them then by Moses, and afterwards by the High Priest. 2. That they _should not
make any Image to represent him_; that is to say, they were not to choose to
themselves, neither in heaven, nor in earth, any Representative of their own
fancying, but obey Moses and Aaron, whom he had appointed to that office. 3.
That _they should not take the Name of God in vain_; that is, they should not
speak rashly of their King, nor dispute his Right, nor the commissions of Moses
and Aaron, his Lieutenants. 4. That _they should every Seventh day abstain from
their ordinary labour_, and employ that time in doing him Publique Honor. The
second Table containeth the Duty of one man towards another, as _To honor
Parents; Not to kill; Not to Commit Adultery; Not to steale; Not to corrupt
Judgment by false witnesse;_ and finally, _Not so much as to designe in their
heart the doing of any injury one to another_. The question now is, Who it was
that gave to these written Tables the obligatory force of Lawes. There is no
doubt but they were made Laws by God himselfe: But because a Law obliges not,
nor is Law to any, but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the
Soveraign; how could the people of Israel that were forbidden to approach the
Mountain to hear what God said to Moses, be obliged to obedience to all those
laws which Moses propounded to them? Some of them were indeed the Laws of
Nature, as all the Second Table; and therefore to be acknowledged for Gods Laws;
not to the Israelites alone, but to all people: But of those that were peculiar
to the Israelites, as those of the first Table, the question remains; saving
that they had obliged themselves, presently after the propounding of them, to
obey Moses, in these words (_Exod_. 20. 19.) _Speak thou to us, and we will hear
thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye_. It was therefore onely Moses
then, and after him the High Priest, whom (by Moses) God declared should
administer this his peculiar Kingdome, that had on Earth, the power to make this
short Scripture of the Decalogue to bee Law in the Common-wealth of Israel. But
Moses, and Aaron, and the succeeding High Priests were the Civill Soveraigns.
Therefore hitherto, the Canonizing, or making of the Scripture Law, belonged to
the Civill Soveraigne.

{#38} #_Of the Judiciall, and Leviticall Law._# The Judiciall Law, that is to
say, the Laws that God prescribed to the Magistrates of Israel, for the rule of
their administration of Justice, and of the Sentences, or Judgments they should
pronounce, in Pleas between man and man; and the Leviticall Law, that is to say,
the rule that God prescribed touching the Rites and Ceremonies of the Priests
and Levites, were all delivered to them by Moses onely; and therefore also
became Lawes, by vertue of the same promise of obedience to Moses. Whether these
laws were then written, or not written, but dictated to the People by Moses
(after his forty dayes being with God in the Mount) by word of mouth, is not
expressed in the Text; but they were all positive Laws, and equivalent to holy
Scripture, and made Canonicall by Moses the Civill Soveraign.

{#39} #_The Second Law._# After the Israelites were come into the Plains of Moab
over against Jericho, and ready to enter into the land of Promise, Moses to the
former Laws added divers others; which therefore are called _Deuteronomy_; that
is, _Second Laws_. And are (as it is written, _Deut_. 29. 1.) _The words of a
Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Children of Israel,
besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb_. For having explained
those former Laws, in the beginning of the Book of _Deuteronomy_, he addeth
others, that begin at the 12. Cha. and continue to the end of the 26. of the
same Book. This Law (_Deut_. 27. 1.) they were commanded to write upon great
stones playstered over, at their passing over Jordan: This Law also was written
by Moses himself in a Book; and delivered into the hands of the _Priests, and to
the Elders of Israel_. (_Deut_. 31. 9.) and commanded (ve. 26.) _to be put in
the side of the Arke_; for in the Ark it selfe was nothing but the _Ten
Commandements_. This was the Law, which Moses (_Deuteronomy_ 17. 18.) commanded
the Kings of Israel should keep a copie of: And this is the Law, which having
been long time lost, was found again in the Temple in the time of Josiah, and by
his authority received for the Law of God. But both Moses at the writing, and
Josiah at the recovery thereof, had both of them the Civill Soveraignty.
Hitherto therefore the Power of making Scripture Canonicall, was in the Civill
Soveraign.

{#40} Besides this Book of the Law, there was no other Book, from the time of
Moses, till after the Captivity, received amongst the Jews for the Law of God.
For the Prophets (except a few) lived in the time of the Captivity it selfe; and
the rest lived but a little before it; and were so far from having their
Prophecies generally received for Laws, as that their persons were persecuted,
partly by false Prophets, and partly by the Kings which were seduced by them.
And this Book it self, which was confirmed by Josiah for the Law of God, and
with it all the History of the Works of God, was lost in the Captivity and sack
of the City of Jerusalem, as appears by that of _2 Esdras 14. 21. Thy Law is
burnt; therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the works
that shall begin_. And before the Captivity, between the time when the Law was
lost, (which is not mentioned in the Scripture, but may probably be thought to
be the time of Rehoboam, when #_I Kings_ 14. 26.# Shishak King of Egypt took
the spoile of the Temple,) and the time of Josiah, when it was found againe,
they had no written Word of God, but ruled according to their own discretion, or
by the direction of such, as each of them esteemed Prophets.

{#41} From hence we may inferre, that the Scriptures of the#_The Old Testament
when made Canonicall._# Old Testament, which we have at this day, were not
Canonicall, nor a Law unto the Jews, till the renovation of their Covenant with
God at their return from the Captivity, and restauration of their Common-wealth
under _Esdras_. But from that time forward they were accounted the Law of the
Jews, and for such translated into Greek by Seventy Elders of Jud{ae}a, and put
into the Library of Ptolemy at Alexandria, and approved for the Word of God. Now
seeing Esdras was the High Priest, and the High Priest was their Civill
Soveraigne, it is manifest, that the Scriptures were never made Laws, but by the
Soveraign Civill Power.

{#42} #_The New Testament began to be Canonicall under Christian Soveraigns._#
By the Writings of the Fathers that lived in the time before the Christian
Religion was received, and authorized by Constantine the Emperour, we may find,
that the Books wee now have of the New Testament, were held by the Christians of
that time (except a few, in respect of whose paucity the rest were called the
Catholique Church, and others H{ae}retiques) for the dictates of the Holy Ghost;
and consequently for the Canon, or Rule of Faith: such was the reverence and
opinion they had of their Teachers; as generally the reverence that the
Disciples bear to their first Masters, in all manner of doctrine they receive
from them, is not small. Therefore there is no doubt, but when S. Paul wrote to
the Churches he had converted; or any other Apostle, or Disciple of Christ, to
those which had then embraced Christ, they received those their Writings for the
true Christian Doctrine. But in that time, when not the Power and Authority of
the Teacher, but the Faith of the Hearer caused them to receive it, it was not
the Apostles that made their own Writings Canonicall, but every Convert made
them so to himself.

{#43} But the question here, is not what any Christian made a Law, or Canon to
himself, (which he might again reject, by the same right he received it;) but
what was so made a Canon to them, as without injustice they could not doe any
thing contrary thereunto. That the New Testament should in this sense be
Canonicall, that is to say, a Law in any place where the Law of the Commonwealth
had not made it so, is contrary to the nature of a Law. For a Law, (as hath been
already shewn) is the Commandement of that Man, or Assembly, to whom we have
given Soveraign Authority, to make such Rules for the direction of our actions,
as hee shall think fit; and to punish us, when we doe any thing contrary to the
same. When therefore any other man shall offer unto us any other Rules, which
the Soveraign Ruler hath not prescribed, they are but Counsell, and Advice;
which, whether good, or bad, hee that is counselled, may without injustice
refuse to observe; and when contrary to the Laws already established, without
injustice cannot observe, how good soever he conceiveth it to be. I say, he
cannot in this case observe the same in his actions, nor in his discourse with
other men; though he may without blame beleeve his private Teachers, and wish he
had the liberty to practise their advice; and that it were publiquely received
for Law. For internall Faith is in its own nature invisible, and consequently
exempted from all humane jurisdiction; whereas the words, and actions that
proceed from it, as breaches of our Civill obedience, are injustice both before
God and Man. Seeing then our Saviour hath denyed his Kingdome to be in this
world, seeing he hath said, he came not to judge, but to save the world, he hath
not subjected us to other Laws than those of the Common-wealth; that is, the
Jews to the Law of Moses, (which he saith (_Mat_. 5.) he came not to destroy,
but to fulfill,) and other Nations to the Laws of their severall Soveraigns, and
all men to the Laws of Nature; the observing whereof, both he himselfe, and his
Apostles have in their teaching recommended to us, as a necessary condition of
being admitted by him in the last day into his eternall Kingdome, wherein shall
be Protection, and Life everlasting. Seeing then our Saviour, and his Apostles,
left not new Laws to oblige us in this world, but new Doctrine to prepare us for
the next; the Books of the New Testament, which containe that Doctrine, untill
obedience to them was commanded, by them that God had given power to on earth to
be Legislators, were not obligatory Canons, that is, Laws, but onely good, and
safe advice, for the direction of sinners in the way to salvation, which every
man might take, and refuse at his owne perill, without injustice.

{#44} Again, our Saviour Christs Commission to his Apostles, and Disciples, was
to Proclaim his Kingdome (not present, but) to come; and to Teach all Nations;
and to Baptize them that should beleeve; and to enter into the houses of them
that should receive them; and where they were not received, to shake off the
dust of their feet against them; but not to call for fire from heaven to destroy
them, nor to compell them to obedience by the Sword. In all which there is
nothing of Power, but of Perswasion. He sent them out as Sheep unto Wolves, not
as Kings to their Subjects. They had not in Commission to make Laws; but to
obey, and teach obedience to Laws made; and consequently they could not make
their Writings obligatory Canons, without the help of the Soveraign Civill
Power. And therefore the Scripture of the New Testament is there only Law, where
the lawfull Civill Power hath made it so. And there also the King, or Soveraign,
maketh it a Law to himself; by which he subjecteth himselfe, not to the Doctor,
or Apostle that converted him, but to God himself, and his Son Jesus Christ, as
immediately as did the Apostles themselves.

{#45} #_Of the Power of Councells to make the Scriptures Law./John 3. 36./John
3. 18._# That which may seem to give the New Testament, in respect of those that
have embraced Christian Doctrine, the force of Laws, in the times, and places of
persecution, is the decrees they made amongst themselves in their Synods. For we
read (_Acts_ 15. 28.) the stile of the Councell of the Apostles, the Elders, and
the whole Church, in this manner, _It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,
to lay upon you no greater burthen than these necessary things, &c_. which is a
stile that signifieth a Power to lay a burthen on them that had received their
Doctrine. Now _to lay a burden on another_, seemeth the same that _to oblige_;
and therefore the Acts of that Councell were Laws to the then Christians.
Neverthelesse, they were no more Laws than are these other Precepts, _Repent; Be
Baptized; Keep the Commandements; Beleeve the Gospel; Come unto me; Sell all
that thou hast; Give it to the poor_; and, _Follow me_; which are not Commands,
but Invitations, and Callings of men to Christianity, like that of _Esay_ 55. 1.
_Ho, every man that thirsteth, come yee to the waters, come, and buy wine and
milke without money_. For first, the Apostles power was no other than that of
our Saviour, to invite men to embrace the Kingdome of God; which they themselves
acknowledged for a Kingdome (not present, but) to come; and they that have no
Kingdome, can make no Laws. And secondly, if their Acts of Councell, were Laws,
they could not without sin be disobeyed. But we read not any where, that they
who received not the Doctrine of Christ, did therein sin; but that they died in
their sins; that is, that their sins against the Laws to which they owed
obedience, were not pardoned. And those Laws were the Laws of Nature, and the
Civill Laws of the State, whereto every Christian man had by pact submitted
himself. And therefore by the Burthen, which the Apostles might lay on such as
they had converted, are not to be understood Laws, but Conditions, proposed to
those that sought Salvation; which they might accept, or refuse at their own
perill, without a new sin, though not without the hazard of being condemned, and
excluded out of the Kingdome of God for their sins past. And therefore of
Infidels, S. John saith not, the wrath of God shall _come_ upon them, but _the
wrath of God remaineth upon them_; and not that they shall be condemned; but
that _they are condemned already_. Nor can it be conceived, that the benefit of
Faith, _is Remission of sins_, unlesse we conceive withall, that the dammage of
Infidelity, is _the Retention of the same sins_.

{#46} But to what end is it (may some man aske), that the Apostles, and other
Pastors of the Church, after their time, should meet together, to agree upon
what Doctrine should be taught, both for Faith and Manners, if no man were
obliged to observe their Decrees? To this may be answered, that the Apostles,
and Elders of that Councell, were obliged even by their entrance into it, to
teach the Doctrine therein concluded, and decreed to be taught, so far forth, as
no precedent Law, to which they were obliged to yeeld obedience, was to the
contrary; but not that all other Christians should be obliged to observe, what
they taught. For though they might deliberate what each of them should teach;
yet they could not deliberate what others should do, unless their Assembly had
had a Legislative Power; which none could have but Civil Soveraigns. For though
God be the Soveraign of all the world, we are not bound to take for his Law,
whatsoever is propounded by every man in his name; nor any thing contrary to the
Civill Law, which God hath expressely commanded us to obey.

{#47} Seeing then the Acts of Councell of the Apostles, were then no Laws, but
Counsells; much lesse are Laws the Acts of any other Doctors, or Councells
since, if assembled without the Authority of the Civil Soveraign. And
consequently, the Books of the New Testament, though most perfect Rules of
Christian Doctrine, could not be made Laws by any other authority then that of
Kings, or Soveraign Assemblies.

{#48} The first Councell, that made the Scriptures we now have, Canon, is not
extant: For that Collection of the Canons of the Apostles, attributed to
_Clemens_, the first Bishop of Rome after S. Peter, is subject to question: For
though the Canonicall books bee there reckoned up; yet these words, _Sint vobis
omnibus Clericis & Laicis Libri venerandi, &c_. containe a distinction of
Clergy, and Laity, that was not in use so neer St. Peters time. The first
Councell for setling the Canonicall Scripture, that is extant, is that of
Laodicea, _Can_. 59. which forbids the reading of other Books then those in the
Churches; which is a Mandate that is not addressed to every Christian, but to
those onely that had authority to read any thing publiquely in the Church; that
is, to Ecclesiastiques onely.

{#49} #_Of the Right of constituting Ecclesiasticall Officers in the time of the
Apostles._# If Ecclesiasticall Officers in the time of the Apostles, some were
Magisteriall, some Ministeriall. Magisteriall were the Offices of preaching of
the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to Infidels; of administring the Sacraments,
and Divine Service; and of teaching the Rules of Faith and Manners to those that
were converted. Ministeriall was the Office of Deacons, that is, of them that
were appointed to the administration of the secular necessities of the Church,
at such time as they lived upon a common stock of mony, raised out of the
voluntary contributions of the faithfull.

{#50} Amongst the Officers Magisteriall, the first, and principall were the
Apostles; whereof there were at first but twelve; and these were chosen and
constituted by our Saviour himselfe; and their Office was not onely to Preach,
Teach, and Baptize, but also to be Martyrs, (Witnesses of our Saviours
Resurrection.) This Testimony, was the specificall, and essentiall mark; whereby
the Apostleship was distinguished from other Magistracy Ecclesiasticall; as
being necessary for an Apostle, either to have seen our Saviour after his
Resurrection, or to have conversed with him before, and seen his works, and
other arguments of his Divinity, whereby they might be taken for sufficient
Witnesses. And therefore at the election of a new Apostle in the place of Judas
Iscariot, S. Peter saith (_Acts_ 1. 21, 22.) _Of these men that have companyed
with us, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning
from the Baptisme of John unto that same day that he was taken up from us_, must
_one be ordained to be a_ Witnesse _with us of his Resurrection_: where, by this
word _must_, is implyed a necessary property of an Apostle, to have companyed
with the first and prime Apostles in the time that our Saviour manifested
himself in the flesh.

{#51} The first Apostle, of those which were not constituted#_Matthias made
Apostle by the Congregation._# by Christ in the time he was upon the Earth, was
_Matthias_, chosen in this manner: There were assembled together in Jerusalem
about 120 Christians (_Acts_ 1. 15.) These appointed two, _Joseph_ the _Just_,
and _Matthias_ (ver. 23.) and caused lots to be drawn; _and_ (ver. 26.) _the Lot
fell on Matthias, and he was numbred with the Apostles_. So that here we see the
ordination of this Apostle, was the act of the Congregation, and not of St.
Peter, nor of the eleven, otherwise then as Members of the Assembly.

{#52} After him there was never any other Apostle ordained,#_Paul and Barnabas
made Apostles by the Church of Antioch._# but Paul and Barnabas; which was done
(as we read _Acts_ 13. 1, 2, 3.) in this manner. _There were in the Church that
was at Antioch, certaine Prophets, and Teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that
was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen; which had been brought up
with Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul. As they ministred unto the Lord, and fasted,
the Holy Ghost said, Separate mee Barnabas, and Saul for the worke whereunto I
have called them. And when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands on
them, they sent them away_.

{#53} By which it is manifest, that though they were called by the Holy Ghost,
their Calling was declared unto them, and their Mission authorized by the
particular Church of Antioch. And that this their calling was to the
Apostleship, is apparent by that, that they are both called (_Acts_ 14. 14.)
Apostles: And that it was by vertue of this act of the Church of Antioch, that
they were Apostles, S. Paul declareth plainly (_Rom_. 1. 1.) in that hee useth
the word, which the Holy Ghost used at his calling: For hee stileth himself, _An
Apostle separated unto the Gospel of God_; alluding to the words of the Holy
Ghost, _Separate me Barnabas and Saul_, &_c_. But seeing the work of an Apostle,
was to be a Witnesse of the Resurrection of Christ, a man may here aske, how S.
Paul, that conversed not with our Saviour before his passion, could know he was
risen. To which is easily answered, that our Saviour himself appeared to him in
the way to Damascus, from Heaven, after his Ascension; _and chose him for a
vessell to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and Children of
Israel_; and consequently (having seen the Lord after his passion) was a
competent Witnesse of his Resurrection: And as for Barnabas, he was a Disciple
before the Passion. It is therefore evident that Paul, and Barnabas were
Apostles; and yet chosen, and authorized (not by the first Apostles alone, but)
by the Church of Antioch; as Matthias was chosen, and authorized by the Church
of Jerusalem.

{#54} #_What Offices in the Church are Magisteriall._# _Bishop_, a word formed
in our language, out of the Greek _Episcopus_, signifieth an Overseer, or
Superintendent of any businesse, and particularly a Pastor, or Shepherd; and
thence by metaphor was taken, not only amongst the Jews that were originally
Shepherds, but also amongst the Heathen, to signifie the Office of a King, or
any other Ruler, or Guide of People, whether he ruled by Laws, or Doctrine. And
so the Apostles were the first Christian Bishops, instituted by Christ himselfe:
in which sense the Apostleship of Judas is called (_Acts_ 1. 20.) _his
Bishoprick_. And afterwards, when there were constituted Elders in the Christian
Churches, with charge to guide Christs flock by their doctrine, and advice;
these Elders were also called Bishops. Timothy was an Elder (which word _Elder_,
in the New Testament is a name of Office, as well as of Age;) yet he was also a
Bishop. And Bishops were then content with the Title of Elders. Nay S. John
himselfe, the Apostle beloved of our Lord, beginneth his Second Epistle with
these words, _The Elder to the Elect Lady_. By which it is evident, that
_Bishop, Pastor, Elder, Doctor_, that is to say, _Teacher_, were but so many
divers names of the same Office in the time of the Apostles. For there was then
no government by Coercion, but only by Doctrine, and Perswading. The Kingdome of
God was yet to come, in a new world; so that there could be no authority to
compell in any Church, till the Common-wealth had embraced the Christian Faith;
and consequently no diversity of Authority, though there were diversity of
Employments.

{#55} Besides these Magisteriall employments in the Church; namely, Apostles,
Bishops, Elders, Pastors, and Doctors, whose calling was to proclaim Christ to
the Jews, and Infidels, and to direct, and teach those that beleeved we read in
the New Testament of no other. For by the names of _Evangelists_ and _Prophets_,
is not signified any Office, but severall Gifts, by which severall men were
profitable to the Church: as Evangelists, by writing the life and acts of our
Saviour; such as were S. _Matthew_ and S. _John_ Apostles, and S. _Marke_ and S.
_Luke_ Disciples, and whosoever else wrote of that subject, (as S. _Thomas_, and
S. _Barnabas_ are said to have done, though the Church have not received the
Books that have gone under their names:) and as Prophets, by the gift of
interpreting the Old Testament; and sometimes by declaring their speciall
Revelations to the Church. For neither these gifts, nor the gifts of Languages,
nor the gift of Casting out Devils, or of Curing other diseases, nor any thing
else did make an Officer in the Church, save onely the due calling and election
to the charge of Teaching.

{#56} As the Apostles, Matthias, Paul, and Barnabas, were#_Ordination of
Teachers._# not made by our Saviour himself, but were elected by the Church,
that is, by the Assembly of Christians; namely, Matthias by the Church of
Jerusalem, and Paul, and Barnabas by the Church of Antioch; so were also the
_Presbyters_, and _Pastors_ in other Cities, elected by the Churches of those
Cities. For proof whereof, let us consider, first, how S. Paul proceeded in the
Ordination of Presbyters, in the Cities where he had converted men to the
Christian Faith, immediately after he and Barnabas had received their
Apostleship. We read (_Acts_ 14. 23.) that _they ordained Elders in every
Church_; which at first sight may be taken for an Argument, that they themselves
chose, and gave them their authority: But if we consider the Originall text, it
will be manifest, that they were authorized, and chosen by the Assembly of the
Christians of each City. For the words there are, χειροτονήσαντες ᾀντο+̂ις
πρεσβντέρονς κατ ἐκκλησίαν that is, _When they had Ordained them Elders by the
Holding up of Hands in every Congregation_. Now it is well enough known, that in
all those Cities, the manner of choosing Magistrates, and Officers, was by
plurality of suffrages; and (because the ordinary way of distinguishing the
Affirmative Votes from the Negatives, was by Holding up of Hands) to ordain an
Officer in any of the Cities, was no more but to bring the people together, to
elect them by plurality of Votes, whether it were by plurality of elevated
hands, or by plurality of voices, or plurality of balls, or beans, or small
stones, of which every man cast in one, into a vessell marked for the
Affirmative, or Negative; for divers Cities had divers customes in that point.
It was therefore the Assembly that elected their own Elders: the Apostles were
onely Presidents of the Assembly to call them together for such Election, and to
pronounce them Elected, and to give them the benediction, which now is called
Consecration. And for this cause they that were Presidents of the Assemblies, as
(in the absence of the Apostles) the Elders were, were called προεστω̑τες and in
Latin _Antistites_; which words signifie the Principall Person of the Assembly,
whose office was to number the Votes, and to declare thereby who was chosen; and
where the Votes were equall, to decide the matter in question, by adding his
own; which is the Office of a President in Councell. And (because all the
Churches had their Presbyters ordained in the same manner,) where the word is
_Constitute_, (as _Titus_ 1. 5.) ίνα καταστήσης κατὰ πόλιν πρεσβντέρονς _For
this cause left I thee in Crete_, _that thou shouldest constitute Elders in
every City_, we are to understand the same thing; namely, that hee should call
the faithfull together, and ordain them Presbyters by plurality of suffrages. It
had been a strange thing, if in a Town, where men perhaps had never seen any
Magistrate otherwise chosen then by an Assembly, those of the Town becomming
Christians, should so much as have thought on any other way of Election of their
Teachers, and Guides, that is to say, of their Presbyters, (otherwise called
Bishops,) then this of plurality of suffrages, intimated by S. Paul (_Acts_ 14.
23.) in the word χειροτονήσαντες: Nor was there ever any choosing of Bishops,
(before the Emperors found it necessary to regulate them in order to the keeping
of the peace amongst them,) but by the Assemblies of the Christians in every
severall Town.

{#57} The same is also confirmed by the continuall practise even to this day, in
the Election of the Bishops of Rome. For if the Bishop of any place, had the
right of choosing another, to the succession of the Pastorall Office, in any
City, at such time as he went from thence, to plant the same in another place;
much more had he had the Right, to appoint his successour in that place, in
which he last resided and dyed: And we find not, that ever any Bishop of Rome
appointed his successor. For they were a long time chosen by the People, as we
may see by the sedition raised about the Election, between _Damasus_, and
_Ursicinus_; which Ammianus Marcellinus saith was so great, that _Juventius_ the
Pr{ae}fect, unable to keep the peace between them, was forced to goe out of the
City; and that there were above an hundred men found dead upon that occasion in
the Church it self. And though they afterwards were chosen, first, by the whole
Clergy of Rome, and afterwards by the Cardinalls; yet never any was appointed to
the succession by his predecessor. If therefore they pretended no right to
appoint their own successors, I think I may reasonably conclude, they had no
right to appoint the successors of other Bishops, without receiving some new
power; which none could take from the Church to bestow on them, but such as had
a lawfull authority, not onely to Teach, but to Command the Church; which none
could doe, but the Civill Soveraign.

{#58} #_Ministers of the Church what:_# The word _Minister_ in the Originall
Διάκονος, signifieth one that voluntarily doth the businesse of another man; and
differeth from a Servant onely in this, that Servants are obliged by their
condition, to what is commanded them; whereas Ministers are obliged onely by
their undertaking, and bound therefore to no more than that they have
undertaken: So that both they that teach the Word of God, and they that
administer the secular affairs of the Church, are both Ministers, but they are
Ministers of different Persons. For the Pastors of the Church, called (_Acts_ 6.
4.) _The Ministers of the Word_, are Ministers of Christ, whose Word it is: But
the Ministery of a _Deacon_, which is called (verse 2. of the same Chapter)
_Serving of Tables_, is a service done to the Church, or Congregation: So that
neither any one man, nor the whole Church, could ever of their Pastor say, he
was their Minister; but of a Deacon, whether the charge he undertook were to
serve tables, or distribute maintenance to the Christians, when they lived in
each City on a common stock, or upon collections, as in the first times, or to
take a care of the House of Prayer, or of the Revenue, or other worldly
businesse of the Church, the whole Congregation might properly call him their
Minister.

{#59} For their employment, as Deacons, was to serve the Congregation; though
upon occasion they omitted not to Preach the Gospel, and maintain the Doctrine
of Christ, every one according to his gifts, as S. Steven did; and both to
Preach, and Baptize, as Philip did: For that Philip, which (_Act_. 8. 5.)
Preached the Gospell at Samaria, and (verse 38.) Baptized the Eunuch, was Philip
the Deacon, not Philip the Apostle. For it is manifest (verse 1.) that when
Philip preached in Samaria, the Apostles were at Jerusalem, and (verse 14.)
_when they heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, sent Peter and John
to them_; by imposition of whose hands, they that were Baptized, (verse 15.)
received (which before by the Baptisme of Philip they had not received) the Holy
Ghost. For it was necessary for the conferring of the Holy Ghost, that their
Baptisme should be administred, or confirmed by a Minister of the Word, not by a
Minister of the Church. And therefore to confirm the Baptisme of those that
Philip the Deacon had Baptized, the Apostles sent out of their own number from
Jerusalem to Samaria, Peter, and John; who conferred on them that before were
but Baptized, those graces that were signs of the Holy Spirit, which at that
time did accompany all true Beleevers; which what they were may be understood by
that which S. _Marke_ saith (chap. 16. 17.) _These signes follow them that
beleeve in my Name; they shall cast out Devills; they shall speak with new
tongues; They shall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it
shall not hurt them; They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover_.
This to doe, was it that Philip could not give; but the Apostles could, and (as
appears by this place) effectually did to every man that truly beleeved; and was
by a Minister of Christ himself Baptized: which power either Christs Ministers
in this age cannot conferre, or else there are very few true Beleevers, or
Christ hath very few Ministers.

{#60} That the first Deacons were chosen, not by the Apostles,#_And how
chosen._# but by a Congregation of the Disciples; that is, of Christian men of
all sorts, is manifest out of _Acts_ 6. where we read that the _Twelve_, after
the number of Disciples was multiplyed, called them together, and having told
them, that it was not fit that the Apostles should leave the Word of God, and
serve tables, said unto them (verse 3.) _Brethren looke you out among you seven
men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and of Wisdome, whom we may
appoint over this businesse_. Here it is manifest, that though the Apostles
declared them elected; yet the Congregation chose them; which also, (verse the
fift) is more expressely said, where it is written, that _the saying pleased the
multitude, and they chose seven, &c_.

{#61} Under the Old Testament, the Tribe of Levi were#_Of Ecclesiasticall
Revenue, under the Law of Moses._# onely capable of the Priesthood, and other
inferiour Offices of the Church. The land was divided amongst the other Tribes
(Levi excepted,) which by the subdivision of the Tribe of Joseph, into Ephraim
and Manasses, were still twelve. To the Tribe of Levi were assigned certain
Cities for their habitation, with the suburbs for their cattell: but for their
portion, they were to have the tenth of the fruits of the land of their
Brethren. Again, the Priests for their maintenance had the tenth of that tenth,
together with part of the oblations, and sacrifices. For God had said to Aaron
(_Numb_. 18. 20.) _Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt
thou have any part amongst them, I am thy part, and thine inheritance amongst
the Children of Israel_. For God being then King, and having constituted the
Tribe of Levi to be his Publique Ministers, he allowed them for their
maintenance, the Publique revenue, that is to say, the part that God had
reserved to himself; which were Tythes, and Offerings: and that is it which is
meant, where God saith, I am thine inheritance. And therefore to the Levites
might not unfitly be attributed the name of _Clergy_ from Κλη̑ρος, which
signifieth Lot, or Inheritance; not that they were heirs of the Kingdome of God,
more than other; but that Gods inheritance, was their maintenance. Now seeing in
this time God himself was their King, and Moses, Aaron, and the succeeding High
Priests were his Lieutenants; it is manifest, that the Right of Tythes, and
Offerings was constituted by the Civill Power.

{#62} After their rejection of God in the demanding of a King, they enjoyed
still the same revenue; but the Right thereof was derived from that, that the
Kings did never take it from them: for the Publique Revenue was at the disposing
of him that was the Publique Person; and that (till the Captivity) was the King.
And again, after the return from the Captivity, they paid their Tythes as before
to the Priest. Hitherto therefore Church Livings were determined by the Civill
Soveraign.

{#63} #_In our Saviours time, and after._# If the maintenance of our Saviour,
and his Apostles, we read onely they had a Purse, (which was carried by Judas
Iscariot;) and, that of the Apostles, such as were Fishermen, did sometimes use
their trade; and that when our Saviour sent the Twelve Apostles to Preach,#_Mat.
10. 9, 10._# e forbad them _to carry Gold, and Silver, and Brasse in their
purses, for that the workman is worthy of his hire_: By which it is probable,
their ordinary maintenance was not unsuitable to their employment; for their
employment was (ver. 8.) _freely to give, because they had freely received_; and
their maintenance was the _free gift_ of those that beleeved the good tyding
they carryed about of the coming of the Messiah their Saviour. To which we may
adde, that which was contributed out of gratitude; by such as our Saviour had
healed of diseases; of which are mentioned _Certain women_ (Luke 8. 2, 3.)
_which had been healed of evill spirits and infirmities; Mary Magdalen, out of
whom went seven Devills; and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods Steward; and
Susanna, and many others, which ministred unto him of their substance_.

{#64} After our Saviours Ascension, the Christians of every City lived in
Common, #_Acts_, 4. 34.# upon the mony which was made of the sale of their
lands and possessions, and laid down at the feet of the Apostles, of good will,
not of duty; for _whilest the Land remained_ (saith S. Peter to Ananias _Acts_
5. 4.) _was it not thine? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power?_ which
sheweth he needed not have saved his land, nor his money by lying, as not being
bound to contribute any thing at all, unlesse he had pleased. And as in the time
of the Apostles, so also all the time downward, till after Constantine the
Great, we shall find, that the maintenance of the Bishops, and Pastors of the
Christian Church, was nothing but the voluntary contribution of them that had
embraced their Doctrine. There was yet no mention of Tythes: but such was in the
time of Constantine, and his Sons, the affection of Christians to their Pastors,
as Ammianus Marcellinus saith (describing the sedition of _Damasus_ and
_Ursicinus_ about the Bishopricke,) that it was worth their contention, in that
the Bishops of those times by the liberality of their flock, and especially of
Matrons, lived splendidly, were carryed in Coaches, and were sumptuous in their
fare and apparell.

{#65} But here may some ask, whether the Pastor were then#_The Ministers of the
Gospel lived on the Benevolence of their flocks./1 Cor. 9. 13._# bound to live
upon voluntary contribution, as upon almes, _For who_ (saith S. Paul 1 _Cor_. 9.
7.) _goeth to war at his own charges? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of
the milke of the flock?_ And again, _Doe ye not know that they which minister
about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at the
Altar, partake with the Altar_; that is to say, have part of that which is
offered at the Altar for their maintenance? And then he concludeth, _Even so
hath the Lord appointed, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the
Gospel_. From which place may be inferred indeed, that the Pastors of the Church
ought to be maintained by their flocks; but not that the Pastors were to
determine, either the quantity, or the kind of their own allowance, and be (as
it were) their own Carvers. Their allowance must needs therefore be determined,
either by the gratitude, and liberality of every particular man of their flock,
or by the whole Congregation. By the whole Congregation it could not be, because
their Acts were then no Laws: Therefore the maintenance of Pastors, before
Emperours and Civill Soveraigns had made Laws to settle it, was nothing but
Benevolence. They that served at the Altar lived on what was offered. So may the
Pastors also take what is offered them by their flock; but not exact what is not
offered. In what Court should they sue for it, who had no Tribunalls? Or if they
had Arbitrators amongst themselves, who should execute their Judgments, when
they had no power to arme their Officers? It remaineth therefore, that there
could be no certaine maintenance assigned to any Pastors of the Church, but by
the whole Congregation; and then onely, when their Decrees should have the force
(not onely of _Canons_, but also) of _Laws_; which Laws could not be made, but
by Emperours, Kings, or other Civill Soveraignes. The Right of Tythes in Moses
Law, could not be applyed to the then Ministers of the Gospell; because Moses
and the High Priests were the Civill Soveraigns of the people under God, whose
Kingdom amongst the Jews was present; whereas the Kingdome of God by Christ is
yet to come.

{#66} Hitherto hath been shewn what the Pastors of the Church are; what are the
points of their Commission (as that they were to Preach, to Teach, to Baptize,
to be Presidents in their severall Congregations;) what is Ecclesiasticall
Censure, _viz_. Excommunication, that is to say, in those places where
Christianity was forbidden by the Civill Laws, a putting of themselves out of
the company of the Excommunicate, and where Christianity was by the Civill Law
commanded, a putting the Excommunicate out of the Congregations of Christians;
who elected the Pastors and Ministers of the Church, (that it was, the
Congregation); who consecrated and blessed them, (that it was the Pastor); what
was their due revenue, (that it was none but their own possessions, and their
own labour, and the voluntary contributions of devout and gratefull Christians).
We are to consider now, what Office in the Church those persons have, who being
Civill Soveraignes, have embraced also the Christian Faith.

{#67} And first, we are to remember, that the Right of#_That the Civill
Soveraign being a Christian hath the Right of appointing Pastors._# Judging what
Doctrines are fit for Peace, and to be taught the Subjects, is in all
Common-wealths inseparably annexed (as hath been already proved cha. 18.) to the
Soveraign Power Civill, whether it be in one Man, or in one Assembly of men. For
it is evident to the meanest capacity, that mens actions are derived from the
opinions they have of the Good, or Evill, which from those actions redound unto
themselves; and consequently, men that are once possessed of an opinion, that
their obedience to the Soveraign Power, will bee more hurtfull to them, than
their disobedience, will disobey the Laws, and thereby overthrow the
Common-wealth, and introduce confusion, and Civill war; for the avoiding
whereof, all Civill Government was ordained. And therefore in all Common-wealths
of the Heathen, the Soveraigns have had the name of Pastors of the People,
because there was no Subject that could lawfully Teach the people, but by their
permission and authority.

{#68} This Right of the Heathen Kings, cannot bee thought taken from them by
their conversion to the Faith of Christ; who never ordained, that Kings for
beleeving in him, should be deposed, that is, subjected to any but himself, or
(which is all one) be deprived of the power necessary for the conservation of
Peace amongst their Subjects, and for their defence against foraign Enemies. And
therefore Christian Kings are still the Supreme Pastors of their people, and
have power to ordain what Pastors they please, to teach the Church, that is, to
teach the People committed to their charge.

{#69} Again, let the right of choosing them be (as before the conversion of
Kings) in the Church, for so it was in the time of the Apostles themselves (as
hath been shewn already in this chapter); even so also the Right will be in the
Civill Soveraign, Christian. For in that he is a Christian, he allowes the
Teaching; and in that he is the Soveraign (which is as much as to say, the
Church by Representation,) the Teachers hee elects, are elected by the Church.
And when an Assembly of Christians choose their Pastor in a Christian
Common-wealth, it is the Soveraign that electeth him, because tis done by his
Authority; In the same manner, as when a Town choose their Maior, it is the act
of him that hath the Soveraign Power: For every act done, is the act of him,
without whose consent it is invalid. And therefore whatsoever examples may be
drawn out of History, concerning the Election of Pastors, by the People, or by
the Clergy, they are no arguments against the Right of any Civill Soveraign,
because they that elected them did it by his Authority.

{#70} Seeing then in every Christian Common-wealth, the Civill Soveraign is the
Supreme Pastor, to whose charge the whole flock of his Subjects is committed,
and consequently that it is by his authority, that all other Pastors are made,
and have power to teach, and performe all other Pastorall offices; it followeth
also, that it is from the Civill Soveraign, that all other Pastors derive their
right of Teaching, Preaching, and other functions pertaining to that Office; and
that they are but his Ministers; in the same manner as the Magistrates of Towns,
Judges in Courts of Justice, and Commanders of Armies, are all but Ministers of
him that is the Magistrates of the whole Common-wealth, Judge of all Causes, and
Commander of the whole Militia, which is alwaies the Civill Soveraign. And the
reason hereof, is not because they that Teach, but because they that are to
Learn, are his Subjects. For let it be supposed, that a Christian King commit
the Authority of Ordaining Pastors in his Dominions to another King, (as divers
Christian Kings allow that power to the Pope;) he doth not thereby constitute a
Pastor over himself, nor a Soveraign Pastor over his People; for that were to
deprive himself of the Civill Power; which depending on the opinion men have of
their Duty to him, and the fear they have of Punishment in another world, would
depend also on the skill, and loyalty of Doctors, who are no lesse subject, not
only to Ambition, but also to Ignorance, than any other sort of men. So that
where a stranger hath authority to appoint Teachers, it is given him by the
Soveraign in whose Dominions he teacheth. Christian Doctors are our
Schoolmasters to Christianity; But Kings are Fathers of Families, and may
receive Schoolmasters for their Subjects from the recommendation of a stranger,
but not from the command; especially when the ill teaching them shall redound to
the great and manifest profit of him that recommends them: nor can they be
obliged to retain them, longer than it is for the Publique good; the care of
which they stand so long charged withall, as they retain any other essentiall
Right of the Soveraignty.

{#71} If a man therefore should ask a Pastor, in the execution#_The Pastorall
Authority of Soveraigns only is de Jure Divino, that of other Pastors is Jure
Civill._# of his Office, as the chief Priests and Elders of the people (_Mat_.
21. 23.) asked our Saviour, _By what authority dost thou these things, and who
gave thee this authority_: he can make no other just Answer, but that he doth it
by the Authority of the Common-wealth, given him by the King, or Assembly that
representeth it. All Pastors, except the Supreme, execute their charges in the
Right, that is by the Authority of the Civill Soveraign, that is, _Jure Civili_.
But the King, and every other Soveraign, executeth his Office of Supreme Pastor,
by immediate Authority from God, that is to say, _in Gods Right_, or _Jure
Divino_. And therefore none but Kings can put into their Titles (a mark of their
submission to God onely) _Dei gratiâ Rex, &c_. Bishops ought to say in the
beginning of their Mandates, _By the favour of the Kings Majesty, Bishop of such
a Diocesse_; or as Civill Ministers, _In his Majesties Name_. For in saying,
_Divinâ providentiâ_, which is the same with _Dei gratiâ_, though disguised,
they deny to have received their authority from the Civill State; and sliely
slip off the Collar of their Civill Subjection, contrary to the unity and
defence of the Common-wealth.

{#72} #_Christian Kings have Power to execute all manner of Pastoral function._#
But if every Christian Soveraign be the Supreme Pastor of his own Subjects, it
seemeth that he hath also the Authority, not only to Preach (which perhaps no
man will deny;) but also to Baptize, and to Administer the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper; and to Consecrate both Temples, and Pastors to Gods service; which
most men deny; partly because they use not to do it; and partly because the
Administration of Sacraments, and Consecration of Persons, and Places to holy
uses, requireth the Imposition of such mens hands, as by the like Imposition
successively from the time of the Apostles have been ordained to the like
Ministery. For proof therefore that Christian Kings have power to Baptize, and
to Consecrate, I am to render a reason, both why they use not to doe it, and
how, without the ordinary ceremony of Imposition of hands, they are made capable
of doing it, when they will.

{#73} There is no doubt but any King, in case he were skilfull in the Sciences,
might by the same Right of his Office, read Lectures of them himself, by which
he authorizeth others to read them in the Universities. Neverthelesse, because
the care of the summe of the businesse of the Common-wealth taketh up his whole
time, it were not convenient for him to apply himself in Person to that
particular. A King may also if he please, sit in Judgment, to hear and determine
all manner of Causes, as well as give others authority to doe it in his name;
but that the charge that lyeth upon him of Command and Government, constrain him
to bee continually at the Helm, and to commit the Ministeriall Offices to others
under him. In the like manner our Saviour (who surely had power to Baptize)
Baptized none #_John 4. 2._# himselfe, but sent his Apostles and Disciples to
Baptize. So also S. Paul, by the necessity of Preaching in divers and far
distant places, Baptized few: Amongst all the Corinthians he Baptized only #_1
Cor. 1. 14, 16._# _Crispus, Cajus_, and _Stephanus_; and the reason was, because
his principall harge was to Preach. Whereby it is manifest, that the greater
Charge, (such as is the Government of the Church,) is a dispensation for the
lesse. The reason therefore why Christian Kings use not to Baptize, #_1 Cor. 1.
17._# is evident, and the same, for which at this day there are few Baptized by
Bishops, and by the Pope fewer.

{#74} And as concerning Imposition of Hands, whether it be needfull, for the
authorizing of a King to Baptize, and Consecrate, we may consider thus.

{#75} Imposition of Hands, was a most ancient publique ceremony amongst the
Jews, by which was designed, and made certain, the person, or other thing
intended in a mans prayer, blessing, sacrifice, consecration, condemnation, or
other speech. So Jacob in blessing the children of Joseph (_Gen_. 48. 14.) _Laid
his right Hand on Ephraim the younger, and his left Hand on Manasseh the first
born_; and this he did _wittingly_ (though they were so presented to him by
Joseph, as he was forced in doing it to stretch out his arms acrosse) to design
to whom he intended the greater blessing. So also in the sacrificing of the
Burnt offering, Aaron is commanded [_Exod_. 29. 10.] _to Lay his Hands on the
head of the bullock_; and [ver. 15.] _to Lay his Hand on the head of the ramme_.
The same is also said again, _Levit_. 1. 4. & 8. 14. Likewise Moses when he
ordained Joshua to be Captain of the Israelites, that is, consecrated him to
Gods service, [_Numb_. 27. 23.] _Laid his Hands upon him, and gave him his
Charge_, designing, and rendring certain, who it was they were to obey in war.
And in the consecration of the Levites [_Numb_. 8. 10.] God commanded that _the
Children of Israel should Put their Hands upon the Levites_. And in the
condemnation of him that had blasphemed the Lord [_Levit_. 24. 14.] God
commanded that _all that heard him should Lay their Hands on his head, and that
all the Congregation should stone him_. And why should they only that heard him,
Lay their Hands upon him, and not rather a Priest, Levite, or other Minister of
Justice, but that none else were able to design, and demonstrate to the eyes of
the Congregation, who it was that had blasphemed, and ought to die? And to
design a man, or any other thing, by the Hand to the Eye, is lesse subject to
mistake, than when it is done to the Eare by a Name.

{#76} And so much was this ceremony observed, that in blessing the whole
Congregation at once, which cannot be done by Laying on of Hands, yet _Aaron_
[_Levit_. 9. 22.] _did lift up his Hand towards the people when he blessed
them_. And we read also of the like ceremony of Consecration of Temples amongst
the Heathen, as that the Priest laid his Hands on some post of the Temple, all
the while he was uttering the words of Consecration. So naturall it is to design
any individuall thing, rather by the Hand, to assure the Eyes, than by Words to
inform the Eare in matters of Gods Publique service.

{#77} This ceremony was not therefore new in our Saviours time. For Jairus
[_Mark_ 5. 23.] whose daughter was sick, besought our Saviour (not to heal her,
but) _to Lay his Hands upon her, that shee might bee healed_. And [_Matth_. 19.
13.] _they brought unto him little children, that hee should Put his Hands on
them, and Pray_.

{#78} According to this ancient Rite, the Apostles, and Presbyters, and the
Presbytery it self, Laid Hands on them whom they ordained Pastors, and withall
prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost; and that not only once,
but sometimes oftner, when a new occasion was presented: but the end was still
the same, namely a punctuall, and religious designation of the person, ordained
either to the Pastorall Charge in general, or to a particular Mission: so
[_Act_. 6. 6.] _The Apostles Prayed, and Laid their Hands_ on the seven Deacons;
which was done, not to give them the Holy Ghost, (for they were full of the Holy
Ghost before they were chosen, as appeareth immediately before, verse 3.) but to
design them to that Office. And after Philip the Deacon had converted certain
persons in Samaria, Peter and John went down [_Act_ 8. 17.] _and Laid their
Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost_. And not only an Apostle, but a
Presbyter had this power: For S. Paul adviseth Timothy [1 _Tim_. 5. 22.] _Lay
Hands suddenly on no man_; that is, designe no man rashly to the Office of a
Pastor. The whole Presbytery Laid their Hands on Timothy, as we read 1 _Tim_. 4.
14. but this is to be understood, as that some did it by the appointment of the
Presbytery, and most likely their προεστὼς, or Prolocutor, which it may be was
St. Paul himself. For in his 2 Epist. to _Tim_. ver. 6. he saith to him. _Stirre
up the gift of God which is in thee, by the  Laying on of my Hands_: where note
by the way, that by the Holy Ghost, is not meant the third Person in the
Trinity, but the Gifts necessary to the Pastorall Office. We read also, that St.
Paul had Imposition of Hands twice; once from Ananias at Damascus [_Acts_ 9. 17,
18.] at the time of his Baptisme; and again [_Acts_ 13. 3.] at Antioch, when he
was first sent out to Preach. The use then of this ceremony considered in the
Ordination of Pastors, was to design the Person to whom they gave such Power.
But if there had been then any Christian, that had had the Power of Teaching
before; the Baptizing of him, that is, the making him a Christian, had given him
no new Power, but had onely caused him to preach true Doctrine, that is, to use
his Power aright; and therefore the Imposition of Hands had been unnecessary;
Baptisme it selfe had been sufficient. But every Soveraign, before Christianity,
had the power of Teaching, and Ordaining Teachers; and therefore Christianity
gave them no new Right, but only directed them in the way of teaching Truth; and
consequently they needed no Imposition of Hands (besides that which is done in
Baptisme) to authorize them to exercise any part of the Pastorall Function, as
namely, to Baptize, and Consecrate. And in the Old Testament, though the Priest
only had right to Consecrate, during the time that the Soveraignty was in the
High Priest; yet it was not so when the Soveraignty was in the King: For we read
[1 _Kings_ 8.] That Solomon Blessed the People, Consecrated the Temple, and
pronounced that Publique Prayer, which is the pattern now for Consecration of
all Christian Churches, and Chappels: whereby it appears, he had not only the
right of Ecclesiasticall Government; but also of exercising Ecclesiasticall
Functions.

{#79} #_The Civill Soveraigne if a Christian, is head of the Church in his own
Dominions._# From this consolidation of the Right Politique, and Ecclesiastique
in Christian Soveraigns, it is evident, they have all manner of Power over their
Subjects, that can be given to man, for the government of mens externall
actions, both in Policy, and Religion; and may make such Laws, as themselves
shall judge fittest, for the government of their own Subjects, both as they are
the Common-wealth, and as they are the Church: for both State, and Church are
the same men.

{#80} If they please therefore, they may (as many Christian Kings now doe)
commit the government of their Subjects in matters of Religion to the Pope; but
then the Pope is in that point Subordinate to them, and exerciseth that Charge
in anothers Dominion _Jure Civili_, in the Right of the Civill Soveraign; not
_Jure Divino_, in Gods Right; and may therefore be discharged of that Office,
when the Soveraign for the good of his Subjects shall think it necessary. They
may also if they please, commit the care of Religion to one Supreme Pastor, or
to an Assembly of Pastors; and give them what power over the Church, or one over
another, they think most convenient; and what titles of honor, as of Bishops,
Archbishops, Priests, or Presbyters, they will; and make such Laws for their
maintenance, either by Tithes, or otherwise, as they please, so they doe it out
of a sincere conscience, of which God onely is the Judge. It is the Civill
Soveraign, that is to appoint Judges, and Interpreters of the Canonicall
Scriptures; for it is he that maketh them Laws. It is he also that giveth
strength to Excommunications; which but for such Laws and Punishments, as may
humble obstinate Libertines, and reduce them to union with the rest of the
Church, would bee contemned. In summe, he hath the Supreme Power in all causes,
as well Ecclesiasticall, as Civill, as far as concerneth actions, and words, for
those onely are known, and may be accused; and of that which cannot be accused,
there is no Judg at all, but God, that knoweth the heart. And these Rights are
incident to all Soveraigns, whether Monarchs, or Assemblies: for they that are
the Representants of a Christian People, are Representants of the Church: for a
Church, and a Common-wealth of Christian People, are the same thing.

{#81} #_Cardinal Bellarmines Books De Summo Pontifice considered._# Though this
that I have here said, and in other places of this Book, seem cleer enough for
the asserting of the Supreme Ecclesiasticall Power to Christian Soveraigns; yet
because the Pope of Romes challenge to that Power universally, hath been
maintained chiefly, and I think as strongly as is possible, by Cardinall
Bellarmine, in his Controversie _De Summo Pontifice_; I have thought it
necessary, as briefly as I can, to examine the grounds, and strength of his
Discourse.

{#82} Of five Books he hath written of this subject, the first#_The first
book._# containeth three Questions: One, Which is simply the best government,
_Monarchy, Aristocracy_, or _Democracy_; and concludeth for neither, but for a
government mixt of all three: Another, which of these is the best Government of
the Church; and concludeth for the mixt, but which should most participate of
Monarchy: The third, whether in this mixt Monarchy, St. Peter had the place of
Monarch. Concerning his first Conclusion, I have already sufficiently proved
(chapt. 18.) that all Governments, which men are bound to obey, are Simple, and
Absolute. In Monarchy there is but One Man Supreme; and all other men that have
any kind of Power in the State, have it by his Commission, during his pleasure;
and execute it in his name: And in Aristocracy, and Democracy, but One Supreme
Assembly, with the same Power that in Monarchy belongeth to the Monarch, which
is not a Mixt, but an Absolute Soveraignty. And of the three sorts, which is the
best, is not to be disputed, where any one of them is already established; but
the present ought alwaies to be preferred, maintained, and accounted best;
because it is against both the Law of Nature, and the Divine positive Law, to
doe any thing tending to the subversion thereof. Besides, it maketh nothing to
the Power of any Pastor, (unlesse he have the Civill Soveraignty,) what kind of
Government is the best; because their Calling is not to govern men by
Commandement, but to teach them, and perswade them by Arguments, and leave it to
them to consider, whether they shall embrace, or reject the Doctrine taught. For
Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, do mark out unto us three sorts of
Soveraigns, not of Pastors; or, as we may say, three sorts of Masters of
Families, not three sorts of Schoolmasters for their children.

{#83} And therefore the second Conclusion, concerning the best form of
Government of the Church, is nothing to the question of the Popes Power without
his own Dominions: For in all other Common-wealths his Power (if hee have any at
all) is that of the Schoolmaster onely, and not of the Master of the Family.

{#84} For the third Conclusion, which is, that St. Peter was Monarch of the
Church, he bringeth for his chiefe argument the place of S. _Matth_. (chap. 16.
18, 19.) _Thou art Peter, And upon this rock I will build my Church, &c. And I
will give thee the keyes of Heaven; whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall
be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in
Heaven_. Which place well considered, proveth no more, but that the Church of
Christ hath for foundation one onely Article; namely, that which Peter in the
name of all the Apostles professing, gave occasion to our Saviour to speak the
words here cited; which that wee may cleerly understand, we are to consider,
that our Saviour preached by himself, by John Baptist, and by his Apostles,
nothing but this Article of Faith, _that he was the Christ_; all other Articles
requiring faith no otherwise, than as founded on that. John began first, (_Mat_.
3. 2.) preaching only this, _The Kingdome of God is at hand_. Then our Saviour
himself (_Mat_. 4. 17.) preached the same: And to his Twelve Apostles, when he
gave them their Commission (_Mat_. 10. 7.) there is no mention of preaching any
other Article but that. This was the fundamentall Article, that is the
Foundation of the Churches Faith. Afterwards the Apostles being returned to him,
he asketh them all, (_Mat_. 16. 13.) not Peter onely, _Who men said he was_; and
they answered, that _some said he was John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
Jeremias, or one of the Prophets_: Then (ver. 15.) he asked them all again, (not
Peter onely) _Whom say yee that I am?_ Therefore S. Peter answered (for them
all) _Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God_; which I said is the
Foundation of the Faith of the whole Church; from which our Saviour takes the
occasion of saying, _Upon this stone I will build my Church_: By which it is
manifest, that by the Foundation-Stone of the Church, was meant the Fundamentall
Article of the Churches Faith. But why then (will some object) doth our Saviour
interpose these words, _Thou art Peter_? If the originall of this text had been
rigidly translated, the reason would easily have appeared: We are therefore to
consider, that the Apostle Simon, was surnamed _Stone_, (which is the
signification of the Syriacke word _Cephas_, and of the Greek word _Petrus_).
Our Saviour therefore after the confession of that Fundamentall Article,
alluding to his name, said (as if it were in English) thus, Thou art _Stone_,
and upon this Stone I will build my Church: which is as much as to say, this
Article, that _I am the Christ_, is the Foundation of all the Faith I require in
those that are to bee members of my Church: Neither is this allusion to a name,
an unusuall thing in common speech: But it had been a strange, and obscure
speech, if our Saviour intending to build his Church on the Person of S. Peter,
had said, _thou art a Stone, and upon this Stone I will build my Church_, when
it was so obvious without ambiguity to have said, _I will build my Church on
thee_; and yet there had been still the same allusion to his name.

{#85} And for the following words, _I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven_, &_c_.
it is no more than what our Saviour gave also to all the rest of his Disciples
[_Matth_. 18. 18.] _Whatsoever yee shall bind on Earth, shall be bound in
Heaven_. _And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven_.
But howsoever this be interpreted, there is no doubt but the Power here granted
belongs to all Supreme Pastors; such as are all Christian Civill Soveraignes in
their own Dominions. In so much, as if St. Peter, or our Saviour himself had
converted any of them to beleeve him, and to acknowledge his Kingdome; yet
because his Kingdome is not of this world, he had left the supreme care of
converting his subjects to none but him; or else hee must have deprived him of
the Soveraignty, to which the Right of Teaching is inseparably annexed. And thus
much in refutation of his first Book, wherein hee would prove St. Peter to have
been the Monarch Universall of the Church, that is to say, of all the Christians
in the world.

{#86} The second Book hath two Conclusions: One,#_The second Book._# that S.
Peter was Bishop of Rome, and there dyed: The other, that the Popes of Rome are
his Successors. Both which have been disputed by others. But supposing them
true; yet if by Bishop of Rome, bee understood either the Monarch of the Church,
or the Supreme Pastor of it; not Silvester, but Constantine (who was the first
Christian Emperour) was that Bishop; and as Constantine, so all other Christian
Emperors were of Right supreme Bishops of the Roman Empire; I say of the Roman
Empire, not of all Christendome: For other Christian Soveraigns had the same
Right in their severall Territories, as to an Office essentially adh{ae}rent to
their Soveraignty. Which shall serve for answer to his second Book.

{#87} In the third Book, he handleth the question whether#_The third Book._# the
Pope be Antichrist. For my part, I see no argument that proves he is so, in that
sense the Scripture useth the name: nor will I take any argument from the
quality of Antichrist, to contradict the Authority he exerciseth, or hath
heretofore exercised in the Dominions of any other Prince, or State.

{#88} It is evident that the Prophets of the Old Testament foretold, and the
Jews expected a Messiah, that is, a Christ, that should re-establish amongst
them the kingdom of God, which had been rejected by them in the time of Samuel,
when they required a King after the manner of other Nations. This expectation of
theirs, made them obnoxious to the Imposture of all such, as had both the
ambition to attempt the attaining of the Kingdome, and the art to deceive the
People by counterfeit miracles, by hypocriticall life, or by orations and
doctrine plausible. Our Saviour therefore, and his Apostles forewarned men of
False Prophets, and of False Christs. False Christs, are such as pretend to be
the _Christ_, but are not, and are called properly _Antichrists_, in such sense,
as when there happeneth a Schisme in the Church by the election of two Popes,
the one calleth the other _Antipapa_, or the false Pope. And therefore
Antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall marks; One, that he
denyeth Jesus to be Christ; and another that he professeth himselfe to bee
Christ. The first Mark is set down by _S. John_ in his 1 Epist. 4. ch. 3. ver.
_Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not
of God; And this is the Spirit of Antichrist._ The other Mark is expressed in
the words of our Saviour, (_Mat_. 24. 5.) _Many shall come in my name, saying, I
am Christ_; and again, _If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ,
there is Christ, beleeve it not_. And therefore Antichrist must be a False
Christ, that is, some one of them that shall pretend themselves to be Christ.
And out of these two Marks, _to deny Jesus to be the Christ_, and to _affirm
himselfe to be the Christ_, it followeth, that he must also be an _Adversary of
Jesus the true Christ_, which is another usuall signification of the word
Antichrist. But of these many Antichrists, there is one speciall one,
ὀΑντίχριστος _The Antichrist_, or _Antichrist_ definitely, as one certaine
person; not indefinitely _an Antichrist_. Now seeing the Pope of Rome, neither
pretendeth himself, nor denyeth Jesus to bee the Christ, I perceive not how he
can be called Antichrist; by which word is not meant, one that falsely
pretendeth to be _His_ Lieutenant, or Vicar generall, but to be _Hee_. There is
also some Mark of the time of this speciall Antichrist, as (_Mat_. 24, 15.) when
that abominable Destroyer, spoken of by Daniel, #_Dan. 9. 27._# shall stand
in the Holy place, and such tribulation as was not since the beginning of the
world, nor ever shall be again, insomuch as if it were to last long, (ver. 22.)
_no flesh could be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened_
(made fewer). But that tribulation is not yet come; for it is to be followed
immediately (ver. 29.) by a darkening of the Sun and Moon, a falling of the
Stars, a concussion of the Heavens, and the glorious coming again of our Saviour
in the cloudes. And therefore _The Antichrist_ is not yet come; whereas, many
Popes are both come and gone. It is true, the Pope in taking upon him to give
Laws to all Christian Kings, and Nations, usurpeth a Kingdome in this world,
which Christ took not on him: but he doth it not _as Christ_, but as _for
Christ_, wherein there is nothing of _The Antichrist_.

{#89} In the fourth Book, to prove the Pope to be the#_The fourth Book._#
supreme Judg in all questions of Faith and Manners, (_which is as much as to be
the absolute Monarch of all Christians in the world,_) he bringeth three
Propositions: The first, that his Judgments are Infallible: The second, that he
can make very Laws, and punish those that observe them not: The third, that our
Saviour conferred all Jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall on the Pope of Rome.

{#90} #_Texts for the Infallibility of the Popes Judgement in points of Faith._#
For the Infallibility of his Judgments, he alledgeth the Scriptures: and first,
that of _Luke 22. 31. Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired you that hee may sift you
as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not; and when thou
art converted, strengthen thy Brethren_. This, according to Bellarmines
exposition, is, that Christ gave here to Simon Peter two priviledges: one, that
neither his Faith should fail, nor the Faith of any of his successors: the
other, that neither he, nor any of his successors should ever define any point
concerning Faith, or Manners erroneously, or contrary to the definition of a
former Pope: Which is a strange, and very much strained interpretation. But he
that with attention readeth that chapter, shall find there is no place in the
whole Scripture, that maketh more against the Popes Authority, than this very
place. The Priests and Scribes seeking to kill our Saviour at the Passeover, and
Judas possessed with a resolution to betray him, and the day of killing the
Passeover being come, our Saviour celebrated the same with his Apostles, which
he said, till the Kingdome of God was come hee would doe no more; and withall
told them, that one of them was to betray him: Hereupon they questioned, which
of them it should be; and withall (seeing the next Passeover their Master would
celebrate should be when he was King) entred into a contention, who should then
be the greatest man. Our Saviour therefore told them, that the Kings of the
Nations had Dominion over their Subjects, and are called by a name (in Hebrew)
that signifies Bountifull; but I cannot be so to you, you must endeavour to
serve one another; I ordain you a Kingdome, but it is such as my Father hath
ordained mee; a Kingdome that I am now to purchase with my blood, and not to
possesse till my second coming; then yee shall eat and drink at my Table, and
sit on Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel: And then addressing himself
to St. Peter, he saith, _Simon, Simon_, Satan seeks by suggesting a present
domination, to weaken your faith of the future; but I have prayed for thee, that
thy faith shall not fail; Thou therefore (Note this,) being converted, and
understanding my Kingdome as of another world, confirm the same faith in thy
Brethren: To which S. Peter answered (as one that no more expected any authority
in this world) _Lord I am ready to goe with thee, not onely to Prison, but_ _to
Death_. Whereby it is manifest, S. Peter had not onely no jurisdiction given him
in this world, but a charge to teach all the other Apostles, that they also
should have none. And for the Infallibility of St. Peters sentence definitive in
matter of Faith, there is no more to be attributed to it out of this Text, than
that Peter should continue in the beleef of this point, namely, that Christ
should come again, and possesse the Kingdome at the day of Judgement; which was
not given by this Text to all his Successors; for wee see they claime it in the
World that now is.

{#91} The second place is that of _Matth_. 16. _Thou art Peter, and upon this
rocke I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
it_. By which (as I have already shewn in this chapter) is proved no more, than
that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against the confession of Peter, which
gave occasion to that speech; namely this, that _Jesus is Christ the Sonne of
God_.

{#92} The third Text is _John_ 21. ver. 16, 17. _Feed my sheep_; which contains
no more but a Commission of Teaching: And if we grant the rest of the Apostles
to be contained in that name of _Sheep_; then it is the supreme Power of
Teaching: but it was onely for the time that there were no Christian Soveraigns
already possessed of that Supremacy. But I have already proved, that Christian
Soveraignes are in their owne Dominions the supreme Pastors, and instituted
thereto, by vertue of their being Baptized, though without other Imposition of
Hands. For such Imposition being a Ceremony of designing the person, is
needlesse, when hee is already designed to the Power of Teaching what Doctrine
he will, by his institution to an Absolute Power over his Subjects For as I have
proved before, Soveraigns are supreme Teachers (in generall) by their Office;
and therefore oblige themselves (by their Baptisme) to teach the Doctrine of
Christ: And when they suffer others to teach their people, they doe it at the
perill of their own souls; for it is at the hands of the Heads of Families that
God will require the account of the instruction of his Children and Servants. It
is of Abraham himself, not of a hireling, that God saith (_Gen_. 18. 19.) _I
know him that he will command his Children, and his houshold after him, that
they keep the way of the Lord, and do justice and judgement_.

{#93} The fourth place is that of _Exod_. 28. 30. _Thou shalt put in the
Breastplate of Judgment, the Urim and the Thummin_: which hee saith is
interpreted by the Septuagint δήλωσιν καὶ ᾀλήθειαν, that is, _Evidence_ and
_Truth_: And thence concludeth, God had given Evidence, and Truth, (which is
almost Infallibility,) to the High Priest. But be it Evidence and Truth it selfe
that was given; or be it but Admonition to the Priest to endeavour to inform
himself cleerly, and give judgment uprightly; yet in that it was given to the
High Priest, it was given to the Civill Soveraign: For such next under God was
the High Priest in the Common-wealth of Israel; and is an argument for Evidence
and Truth, that is, for the Ecclesiasticall Supremacy of Civill Soveraigns over
their own Subjects, against the pretended Power of the Pope. These are all the
Texts hee bringeth for the Infallibility of the Judgement of the Pope, in point
of Faith.

{#94} #_Texts for the same in point of Manners._# For the Infallibility of his
Judgment concerning Manners, hee bringeth one Text, which is that of _John 16.
13. When the Spirit of truth is come, hee will lead you into all truth_: where
(saith he) by _all truth_, is meant, at least, _all truth necessary to
salvation_. But with this mitigation, he attributeth no more Infallibility to
the Pope, than to any man that professeth Christianity, and is not to be damned:
For if any man erre in any point, wherein not to erre is necessary to Salvation,
it is impossible he should be saved; for that onely is necessary to Salvation,
without which to be saved is impossible. What points these are, I shall declare
out of the Scripture in the Chapter following. In this place I say no more, but
that though it were granted, the Pope could not possibly teach any error at all,
yet doth not this entitle him to any Jurisdiction in the Dominions of another
Prince, unlesse we shall also say, a man is obliged in conscience to set on work
upon all occasions the best workman, even then also when he hath formerly
promised his work to another.

{#95} Besides the Text, he argueth from Reason, thus. If the Pope could erre in
necessaries, then Christ hath not sufficiently provided for the Churches
Salvation; because he hath commanded her to follow the Popes directions. But
this Reason is invalid, unlesse he shew when, and where Christ commanded that,
or took at all any notice of a Pope: Nay granting whatsoever was given to S.
Peter, was given to the Pope; yet seeing there is in the Scripture no command to
any man to obey St. Peter, no man can bee just, that obeyeth him, when his
commands are contrary to those of his lawfull Soveraign.

{#96} Lastly, it hath not been declared by the Church, nor by the Pope himselfe,
that he is the Civill Soveraign of all the Christians in the world; and
therefore all Christians are not bound to acknowledge his Jurisdiction in point
of Manners. For the Civill Soveraignty, and supreme Judicature in controversies
of Manners, are the same thing: And the Makers of Civill Laws, are not onely
Declarers, but also Makers of the justice, and injustice of actions; there being
nothing in mens Manners that makes them righteous, or unrighteous, but their
conformity with the Law of the Soveraign. And therefore when the Pope
challengeth Supremacy in controversies of Manners, hee teacheth men to disobey
the Civill Soveraign; which is an erroneous Doctrine, contrary to the many
precepts of our Saviour and his Apostles, delivered to us in the Scripture.

{#97} To prove the Pope has Power to make Laws, he alledgeth many places; as
first, [_Deut. 17. 12._] _The man that will doe presumptuously, and will not
hearken unto the Priest, (that standeth to Minister there before the Lord thy
God, or unto the Judge,) even that man shall die, and thou shalt put away the
evill from Israel._ For answer whereunto, we are to remember that the High
Priest (next and immediately under God) was the Civill Soveraign; and all Judges
were to be constituted by him. The words alledged sound therefore thus. _The man
that will presume to disobey the Civill Soveraign for the time being, or any of
his Officers in the execution of their places, that man shall die, &c_. which is
cleerly for the Civill Soveraignty, against the Universall power of the Pope.

{#98} Secondly, he alledgeth that of _Matth. 16. Whatsoever yee shall bind, &c_.
and interpreteth it for such _binding_ as is attributed (_Matth_. 23. 4.) to the
Scribes and Pharisees, _They bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be born, and
lay them on mens shoulders_; by which is meant (he sayes) Making of Laws; and
concludes thence, that the Pope can make Laws. But this also maketh onely for
the Legislative power of Civill Soveraigns: For the Scribes, and Pharisees sat
in Moses Chaire, but Moses next under God was Soveraign of the People of Israel:
and therefore our Saviour commanded them to doe all that they should say, but
not all that they should do. That is, to obey their Laws, but not follow their
Example.

{#99} The third place, is _John_ 21. 16. _Feed my sheep_; which is not a Power
to make Laws, but a command to Teach. Making Laws belongs to the Lord of the
Family; who by his owne discretion chooseth his Chaplain, as also a Schoolmaster
to Teach his children.

{#100} The fourth place _John_ 20. 21. is against him. The words are, _As my
Father sent me, so send I you_. But our Saviour was sent to Redeem (by his
Death) such as should Beleeve; and by his own, and his Apostles preaching to
prepare them for their entrance into his Kingdome; which he himself saith, is
not of this world, and hath taught us to pray for the coming of it hereafter,
though hee refused (_Acts_ 1. 6, 7.) to tell his Apostles when it should come;
and in which, when it comes, the twelve Apostles shall sit on twelve Thrones
(every one perhaps as high as that of St. Peter) to judge the twelve tribes of
Israel. Seeing then God the Father sent not our Saviour to make Laws in this
present world, wee may conclude from the Text, that neither did our Saviour send
S. Peter to make Laws here, but to perswade men to expect his second comming
with a stedfast faith; and in the mean time, if Subjects, to obey their Princes;
and if Princes, both to beleeve it themselves, and to do their best to make
their Subjects doe the same; which is the Office of a Bishop. Therefore this
place maketh most strongly for the joining of the Ecclesiasticall Supremacy to
the Civill Soveraignty, contrary to that which Cardinall Bellarmine alledgeth it
for.

{#101} The fift place is _Acts_ 15. 28. _It hath seemed good to the Holy Spirit,
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than these necessary things, that
yee abstaine from meats offered to Idols, and from bloud, and from things
strangled, and from fornication_. Here hee notes the word _Laying of burdens_
for the Legislative Power. But who is there, that reading this Text, can say,
this stile of the Apostles may not as properly be used in giving Counsell, as in
making Laws? The stile of a Law is, _We command_: But, _We think good_, is the
ordinary stile of them, that but give Advice; and they lay a Burthen that give
Advice, though it bee conditionall, that is, if they to whom they give it, will
attain their ends: And such is the Burthen, of abstaining from things strangled,
and from bloud; not absolute, but in case they will not erre. I have shewn
before (chap. 25.) that Law, is distinguished from Counsell, in this, that the
reason of a Law, is taken from the designe, and benefit of him that prescribeth
it; but the reason of a Counsell, from the designe, and benefit of him, to whom
the Counsell is given. But here, the Apostles aime onely at the benefit of the
converted Gentiles, namely their Salvation; not at their own benefit; for having
done their endeavour, they shall have their reward, whether they be obeyed, or
not. And therefore the Acts of this Councell, were not Laws, but Counsells.

{#102} The sixt place is that of _Rom. 13. Let every Soul be subject to the
Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God_; which is meant, he saith not
onely of Secular, but also of Ecclesiasticall Princes. To which I answer, first,
that there are no Ecclesiasticall Princes but those that are also Civill
Soveraignes; and their Principalities exceed not the compasse of their Civill
Soveraignty; without those bounds though they may be received for Doctors, they
cannot be acknowledged for Princes. For if the Apostle had meant, we should be
subject both to our own Princes, and also to the Pope, he had taught us a
doctrine, which Christ himself hath told us is impossible, namely, _to serve two
Masters_. And though the Apostle say in another place, I _write these things
being absent, lest being present I should use sharpnesse, according to the Power
which the Lord hath given me_; it is not, that he challenged a Power either to
put to death, imprison, banish, whip, or fine any of them, which are
Punishments; but onely to Excommunicate, which (without the Civil Power) is no
more but a leaving of their company, and having no more to doe with them, than
with a Heathen man, or a Publican; which in many occasions might be a greater
pain to the Excommunicant, than to the Excommunicate.

{#103} The seventh place is 1 _Cor_. 4. 21. _Shall I come unto you with a Rod,
or in love, and the spirit of lenity?_ But here again, it is not the Power of a
Magistrate to punish offenders, that is meant by a Rod; but onely the Power of
Excommunication, which is not in its owne nature a Punishment, but onely a
Denouncing of punishment, that Christ shall inflict, when he shall be in
possession of his Kingdome, at the day of Judgment. Nor then also shall it bee
properly a Punishment, as upon a Subject that hath broken the Law; but a
Revenge, as upon an Enemy, or Revolter, that denyeth the Right of our Saviour to
the Kingdome: And therefore this proveth not the Legislative Power of any
Bishop, that has not also the Civill Power.

{#104} The eighth place is, _Timothy_ 3. 2. _A Bishop must be the husband but of
one wife, vigilant, sober, &c_. which he saith was a Law. I thought that none
could make a Law in the Church, but the Monarch of the Church, St. Peter. But
suppose this Precept made by the authority of St. Peter; yet I see no reason why
to call it a Law, rather than an Advice, seeing Timothy was not a Subject, but a
Disciple of S. Paul; nor the flock under the charge of Timothy, his Subjects in
the Kingdome, but his Scholars in the Schoole of Christ: If all the Precepts he
giveth Timothy, be Laws, why is not this also a Law, _Drink no longer water, but
use a little wine for thy healths sake_? And why are not also the Precepts of
good Physitians, so many Laws? but that it is not the Imperative manner of
speaking, but an absolute Subjection to a Person, that maketh his Precepts Laws.

{#105} In like manner, the ninth place, 1 _Tim_. 5. 19. _Against an Elder
receive not an accusation, but before two or three Witnesses_, is a wise
Precept, but not a Law.

{#106} The tenth place is, _Luke_ 10. 16. _He that heareth you, heareth mee; and
he that despiseth you, despiseth me_. And there is no doubt, but he that
despiseth the Counsell of those that are sent by Christ, despiseth the Counsell
of Christ himself. But who are those now that are sent by Christ, but such as
are ordained Pastors by lawfull Authority? and who are lawfully ordained, that
are not ordained by the Soveraign Pastor? and who is ordained by the Soveraign
Pastor in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not ordained by the authority of
the Soveraign thereof? Out of this place therefore it followeth, that he which
heareth his Soveraign being a Christian, heareth Christ; and hee that despiseth
the Doctrine which his King being a Christian, authorizeth, despiseth the
Doctrine of Christ (which is not that which Bellarmine intendeth here to prove,
but the contrary). But all this is nothing to a Law. Nay more, a Christian King,
as a Pastor, and Teacher of his Subjects, makes not thereby his Doctrines Laws.
He cannot oblige men to beleeve; though as a Civill Soveraign he may make Laws
suitable to his Doctrine, which may oblige men to certain actions, and sometimes
to such as they would not otherwise do, and which he ought not to command; and
yet when they are commanded, they are Laws; and the externall actions done in
obedience to them, without the inward approbation, are the actions of the
Soveraign, and not of the Subject, which is in that case but as an instrument,
without any motion of his owne at all; because God hath commanded to obey them.

{#107} The eleventh, is every place, where the Apostle for Counsell, putteth
some word, by which men use to signifie Command; or calleth the following of his
Counsell, by the name of Obedience. And therefore they are alledged out of 1
_Cor_. 11. 2. _I commend you for keeping my Precepts as I delivered them to
you_. The Greek is, _I commend you for keeping those things I delivered to you,
as I delivered them_. Which is far from signifying that they were Laws, or any
thing else, but good Counsell. And that of 1 _Thess_. 4. 2. _You know what
commandements we gave you_: where the Greek word is παραγγελίας ἐδώκαμεν
equivalent to παρεδώκαμεν _what wee delivered to you_, as in the place next
before alledged, which does not prove the Traditions of the Apostles, to be any
more than Counsells; though as is said in the 8 verse, _he that despiseth them,
despiseth not man, but God_: For our Saviour himself came not to Judge, that is,
to be King in this world; but to Sacrifice himself for Sinners, and leave
Doctors in his Church, to lead, not to drive men to Christ, who never accepteth
forced actions, (which is all the Law produceth,) but the inward conversion of
the heart; which is not the work of Laws, but of Counsell, and Doctrine.

{#108} And that of 2 _Thess_. 3. 14. _If any man Obey not our word by this
Epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may bee ashamed_:
where from the word _Obey_, he would inferre, that this Epistle was a Law to the
Thessalonians. The Epistles of the Emperours were indeed Laws. If therefore the
Epistle of S. Paul were also a Law, they were to obey two Masters. But the word
_Obey_, as it is in the Greek πακούει signifieth _hearkning to_, or _putting in
practice_, not onley that which is Commanded by him that has right to punish,
but also that which is delivered in a way of Counsell for our good; and
therefore St. Paul does not bid kill him that disobeys, nor beat, nor imprison,
nor amerce him, which Legislators may all do; but avoid his company, that he may
bee ashamed: whereby it is evident, it was not the Empire of an Apostle, but his
Reputation amongst the Faithfull, which the Christians stood in awe of.

{#109} The last place is that of _Heb_. 13. 17. _Obey your Leaders, and submit
your selves to them, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
account_: And here also is intended by Obedience, a following of their Counsell:
For the reason of our Obedience, is not drawn from the will and command of our
Pastors, but from our own benefit, as being the Salvation of our Souls they
watch for, and not for the Exaltation of their own Power, and Authority. If it
were meant here, that all they teach were Laws, then not onely the Pope, but
every Pastor in his Parish should have Legislative Power. Again, they that are
bound to obey, their Pastors, have no power to examine their commands. What then
shall wee say to St. _John_ who bids us (1 Epist. chap. 4. ver. 1.) _Not to
beleeve every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, because
many false Prophets are gone out into the world?_ It is therefore manifest, that
wee may dispute the Doctrine of our Pastors; but no man can dispute a Law. The
Commands of Civill Soveraigns are on all sides granted to be Laws: if any else
can make a Law besides himselfe, all Common-wealth, and consequently all Peace,
and Justice must cease; which is contrary to all Laws, both Divine and Humane.
Nothing therefore can be drawn from these, or any other places of Scripture, to
prove the Decrees of the Pope, where he has not also the Civill Soveraignty, to
be Laws.

{#110} #_The question of Superiority between the Pope and other Bishops._# The
last point hee would prove, is this, _That our Saviour Christ has committed
Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction immediately to none but the Pope_. Wherein he
handleth not the Question of Supremacy between the Pope and Christian Kings, but
between the Pope and other Bishops. And first, he sayes it is agreed, that the
Jurisdiction of Bishops, is at least in the generall _de Jure Divino_, that is,
in the Right of God; for which he alledges S. Paul, _Ephes_. 4. 11. where hee
sayes, that Christ after his Ascension into heaven, _gave gifts to men, some
Apostles, some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors, and some
Teachers_: And thence inferres, they have indeed their Jurisdiction in Gods
Right; but will not grant they have it immediately from God, but derived through
the Pope. But if a man may be said to have his Jurisdiction _de Jure Divino_,
and yet not immediately; what lawfull Jurisdiction, though but Civill, is there
in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not also _de Jure Divino_? For Christian
Kings have their Civill Power from God immediately; and the Magistrates under
him exercise their severall charges in vertue of his Commission; wherein that
which they doe, is no lesse _de Jure Divino mediato_, than that which the
Bishops doe, in vertue of the Popes Ordination. All lawfull Power is of God,
immediately in the Supreme Governour, and mediately in those that have Authority
under him: So that either hee must grant every Constable in the State to hold
his Office in the Right of God; or he must not hold that any Bishop holds his
so, besides the Pope himselfe.

{#111} But this whole Dispute, whether Christ left the Jurisdiction to the Pope
onely, or to other Bishops also, if considered out of those places where the
Pope has the Civill Soveraignty, is a contention _de lana Caprina_: For none of
them (where they are not Soveraigns) has any Jurisdiction at all. For
Jurisdiction is the Power of hearing and determining Causes between man and man;
and can belong to none, but him that hath the Power to prescribe the Rules of
Right and Wrong; that is, to make Laws; and with the Sword of Justice to compell
men to obey his Decisions, pronounced either by himself, or by the Judges he
ordaineth thereunto; which none can lawfully do, but the Civill Soveraign.

{#112} Therefore when he alledgeth out of the 6 of _Luke_, that our Saviour
called his Disciples together, and chose twelve of them which he named Apostles,
he proveth that he Elected them (all, except Matthias, Paul and Barnabas,) and
gave them Power and Command to Preach, but not to Judge of Causes between man
and man: for that is a Power which he refused to take upon himselfe, saying,
_Who made me a Judge, or a Divider, amongst you?_ and in another place, _My
Kingdome is not of this world_. But hee that hath not the Power to hear, and
determine Causes between man and man, cannot be said to have any Jurisdiction at
all. And yet this hinders not, but that our Saviour gave them Power to Preach
and Baptize in all parts of the world, supposing they were not by their own
lawfull Soveraign forbidden: For to our own Soveraigns Christ himself, and his
Apostles, have in sundry places expressely commanded us in all things to be
obedient.

{#113} The arguments by which he would prove, that Bishops receive their
Jurisdiction from the Pope (seeing the Pope in the Dominions of other Princes
hath no Jurisdiction himself,) are all in vain. Yet because they prove, on the
contrary, that all Bishops receive Jurisdiction when they have it from their
Civill Soveraigns, I will not omit the recitall of them.

{#114} The first, is from _Numbers_ 11. where Moses not being able alone to
undergoe the whole burthen of administring the affairs of the People of Israel,
God commanded him to choose Seventy Elders, and took part of the spirit of
Moses, to put it upon those Seventy Elders: by which is understood, not that God
weakned the spirit of Moses, for that had not eased him at all; but that they
had all of them their authority from him; wherein he doth truly, and ingenuously
interpret that place. But seeing Moses had the entire Soveraignty in the
Commonwealth of the Jews, it is manifest, that it is thereby signified, that
they had their Authority from the Civill Soveraign: and therefore that place
proveth, that Bishops in every Christian Common-wealth have their Authority from
the Civill Soveraign; and from the Pope in his own Territories only, and not in
the Territories of any other State.

{#115} The second argument, is from the nature of Monarchy; wherein all
Authority is in one Man, and in others by derivation from him: But the
Government of the Church, he says, is Monarchicall. This also makes for
Christian Monarchs. For they are really Monarchs of their own people; that is,
of their own Church (for the Church is the same thing with a Christian people;)
whereas the Power of the Pope, though hee were S. Peter, is neither Monarchy,
nor hath any thing of _Archicall_, nor _Craticall_, but onely of _Didacticall_;
For God accepteth not a forced, but a willing obedience.

{#116} The third, is, from that the _Sea_ of S. Peter is called by S. Cyprian,
the _Head_, the _Source_, the _Roote_, the _Sun_, from whence the Authority of
Bishops is derived. But by the Law of Nature (which is a better Principle of
Right and Wrong, than the word of any Doctor that is but a man) the Civill
Soveraign in every Common-wealth, is the _Head_, the _Source_, the _Root_, and
the _Sun_, from which all Jurisdiction is derived. And therefore the
Jurisdiction of Bishops, is derived from the Civill Soveraign.

{#117} The fourth, is taken from the Inequality of their Jurisdictions: For if
God (saith he) had given it them immediately, he had given aswell Equality of
Jurisdiction, as of Order: But wee see, some are Bishops but of [one] Town, some
of a hundred Towns, and some of many whole Provinces; which differences were not
determined by the command of God; their Jurisdiction therefore is not of God,
but of Man; and one has a greater, another a lesse, as it pleaseth the Prince of
the Church. Which argument, if he had proved before, that the Pope had had an
Universall Jurisdiction over all Christians, had been for his purpose. But
seeing that hath not been proved, and that it is notoriously known, the large
Jurisdiction of the Pope was given him by those that had it, that is, by the
Emperours of Rome, (for the Patriarch of Constantinople, upon the same title,
namely, of being Bishop of the Capitall City of the Empire, and Seat of the
Emperour, claimed to be equall to him,) it followeth, that all other Bishops
have their Jurisdiction from the Soveraigns of the place wherein they exercise
the same: And as for that cause they have not their Authority _de Jure Divino_;
so neither hath the Pope his _de Jure Divino_, except onely where hee is also
the Civill Soveraign.

{#118} His fift argument is this, _If Bishops have their Jurisdiction
immediately from God, the Pope could not take it from them, for he can doe
nothing contrary to Gods ordination_; And this consequence is good, and well
proved. _But_ (saith he) _the Pope can do this, and has done it_. This also is
granted, so he doe it in his own Dominions, or in the Dominions of any other
Prince that hath given him that Power; but not universally, in Right of the
Popedome: For that power belongeth to every Christian Soveraign, within the
bounds of his owne Empire, and is inseparable from the Soveraignty. Before the
People of Israel had (by the commandment of God to Samuel) set over themselves a
King, after the manner of other Nations, the High Priest had the Civill
Government; and none but he could make, nor depose an inferiour Priest: But that
Power was afterwards in the King, as may be proved by this same argument of
Bellarmine; For if the Priest (be he the High Priest or any other) had his
Jurisdiction immediately from God, then the King could not take it from him;
_for he could doe nothing contrary to Gods ordinance_: But it is certain, that
King Solomon (1 _Kings_ 2. 26.) deprived Abiathar the High Priest of his Office,
and placed Zadok (verse 35.) in his room. Kings therefore may in the like manner
Ordaine, and Deprive Bishops, as they shall thinke fit, for the well governing
of their Subjects.

{#119} His sixth argument is this, If Bishops have their Jurisdiction _de Jure
Divino_ (that is, _immediately from God_,) they that maintaine it, should bring
some Word of God to prove it: But they can bring none. The argument is good; I
have therefore nothing to say against it. But it is an argument no lesse good,
to prove the Pope himself to have no Jurisdiction in the Dominion of any other
Prince.

{#120} Lastly, hee bringeth for argument, the testimony of two Popes,
_Innocent_, and _Leo_; and I doubt not but hee might have alledged, with as good
reason, the testimonies of all the Popes almost since S. Peter: For considering
the love of Power naturally implanted in mankind, whosoever were made Pope, he
would be tempted to uphold the same opinion. Neverthelesse, they should therein
but doe, as _Innocent_, and _Leo_ did, bear witnesse of themselves, and
therefore their witnesse should not be good.

{#121} In the fift Book he hath four Conclusions. The first is, _That the Pope
is not Lord of all the world_: #_Of the Popes Temporall Power._# The second,
_That the Pope is not Lord of all the Christian world:_ The third, _That the
Pope_ (without his owne Territory) _has not any Temporall Jurisdiction
DIRECTLY_: These three Conclusions are easily granted. The fourth is, _That the
Pope has_ (in the Dominions of other Princes) the Supreme _Temporall Power
INDIRECTLY_: which is denyed; unlesse hee mean by _Indirectly_, that he has
gotten it by Indirect means; then is that also granted. But I understand, that
when he saith he hath it _Indirectly_, he means, that such Temporall
Jurisdiction belongeth to him of Right, but that this Right is but a Consequence
of his Pastorall Authority, the which he could not exercise, unlesse he have the
other with it: And therefore to the Pastorall Power (which he calls Spirituall)
the Supreme Power Civill is necessarily annexed; and that thereby hee hath a
Right to change Kingdomes, giving them to one, and taking them from another,
when he shall think it conduces to the Salvation of Souls.

{#122} Before I come to consider the Arguments by which hee would prove this
Doctrine, it will not bee amisse to lay open the Consequences of it; that
Princes, and States, that have the Civill Soveraignty in their severall
Common-wealths, may bethink themselves, whether it bee convenient for them, and
conducing to the good of their Subjects, of whom they are to give an account at
the day of Judgment, to admit the same.

{#123} When it is said, the Pope hath not (in the Territories of other States)
the Supreme Civill Power _Directly_; we are to understand, he doth not challenge
it, as other Civill Soveraigns doe, from the originall submission thereto of
those that are to be governed. For it is evident, and has already been
sufficiently in this Treatise demonstrated, that the Right of all Soveraigns, is
derived originally from the consent of every one of those that are to bee
governed; whether they that choose him, doe it for their common defence against
an Enemy, as when they agree amongst themselves to appoint a Man, or an Assembly
of men to protect them; or whether they doe it, to save their lives, by
submission to a conquering Enemy. The Pope therefore, when he disclaimeth the
Supreme Civill Power over other States _Directly_, denyeth no more, but that his
Right cometh to him by that way; He ceaseth not for all that, to claime it
another way; and that is, (without the consent of them that are to be governed)
by a Right given him by God, (which hee calleth _Indirectly_,) in his Assumption
to the Papacy. But by what way soever he pretend, the Power is the same; and he
may (if it bee granted to be his Right) depose Princes and States, as often as
it is for the Salvation of Soules, that is, as often as he will; for he claimeth
also the Sole Power to Judge, whether it be to the Salvation of mens Souls, or
not. And this is the Doctrine, not onely that Bellarmine here, and many other
Doctors teach in their Sermons and Books, but also that some Councells have
decreed, and the Popes have accordingly, when the occasion hath served them, put
in practise. For the fourth Councell of Lateran held under Pope _Innocent_ the
third, (in the third Chap. _De H{ae}reticis_,) hath this Canon. _If a King at
the Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of H{ae}retiques, and being
Excommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a yeer, his Subjects
are absolved of their Obedience_. And the practise hereof hath been seen on
divers occasions; as in the Deposing of _Chilperique_, King of France; in the
Translation of the Roman Empire to _Charlemaine_; in the Oppression of _John_
King of England; in Transferring the Kingdome of _Navarre_; and of late years,
in the League against _Henry_ the third of France, and in many more occurrences.
I think there be few Princes that consider not this as Injust, and Inconvenient;
but I wish they would all resolve to be Kings, or Subjects. Men cannot serve two
Masters: They ought therefore to ease them, either by holding the Reins of
Government wholly in their own hands; or by wholly delivering them into the
hands of the Pope; that such men as are willing to be obedient, may be protected
in their obedience. For this distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall Power is
but words. Power is as really divided, and as dangerously to all purposes, by
sharing with another _Indirect_ Power, as with a _Direct_ one. But to come now
to his Arguments.

{#124} The first is this, _The Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall:
Therefore he that hath the Supreme Power  Spirituall, hath right to command
Temporall Princes, and dispose of their Temporalls in order to the Spirituall._
As for the distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall, let us consider in what
sense it may be said intelligibly, that the Temporall, or Civill Power is
subject to the Spirituall. There be but two ways that those words can be made
sense. For when wee say, one Power is subject to another Power, the meaning
either is, that he which hath the one, is subject to him that hath the other; or
that the one Power is to the other, as the means to the end. For wee cannot
understand, that one Power hath Power over another Power; or that one Power can
have Right or Command over another: For Subjection, Command, Right, and Power
are accidents, not of Powers, but of Persons: One Power may be subordinate to
another, as the art of a Sadler, to the art of a Rider. If then it bee granted,
that the Civill Government be ordained as a means to bring us to a Spirituall
felicity; yet it does not follow, that if a King have the Civill Power, and the
Pope the Spirituall, that therefore the King is bound to obey the Pope, more
then every Sadler is bound to obey every Rider. Therefore as from Subordination
of an Art, cannot be inferred the Subjection of the Professor; so from the
Subordination of a Government, cannot be inferred the Subjection of the
Governor. When therefore he saith, the Civill Power is Subject to the
Spirituall, his meaning is, that the Civill Soveraign, is Subject to the
Spirituall Soveraign. And the Argument stands thus, _The Civil Soveraign, is
subject to the Spirituall; Therefore the Spirituall Prince may command_
_Temporall Princes_. Where the Conclusion is the same, with the Antecedent he
should have proved. But to prove it, he alledgeth first, this reason, _Kings and
Popes, Clergy and Laity make but one Common-wealth; that is to say, but one
Church: And in all Bodies the Members depend one upon another: But things
Spirituall depend not of things Temporall: Therefore Temporall depend on
Spirituall. And therefore are Subject to them_. In which Argumentation there be
two grosse errours: one is, that all Christian Kings, Popes, Clergy, and all
other Christian men, make but one Common-wealth: For it is evident that France
is one Common-wealth, Spain another, and Venice a third, &c. And these consist
of Christians; and therefore also are severall Bodies of Christians; that is to
say, severall Churches: And their severall Soveraigns Represent them, whereby
they are capable of commanding and obeying, of doing and suffering, as a
naturall man; which no Generall or Universall Church is, till it have a
Representant; which it hath not on Earth: for if it had, there is no doubt but
that all Christendome were one Common-wealth, whose Soveraign were that
Representant, both in things Spirituall and Temporall: And the Pope, to make
himself this Representant, wanteth three things that our Saviour hath not given
him, to _Command_, and to _Judge_, and to _Punish_, otherwise than (by
Excommunication) to run from those that will not Learn of him: For though the
Pope were Christs onely Vicar, yet he cannot exercise his government, till our
Saviours second coming: And then also it is not the Pope, but St. Peter
himselfe, with the other Apostles, that are to be Judges of the world.

{#125} The other errour in this his first Argument is, that he sayes, the
Members of every Common-wealth, as of a naturall Body, depend one of another: It
is true, they coh{ae}re together; but they depend onely on the Soveraign, which
is the Soul of the Common-wealth; which failing, the Common-wealth is dissolved
into a Civill war, no one man so much as coh{ae}ring to another, for want of a
common Dependence on a known Soveraign; Just as the Members of the naturall Body
dissolve into Earth, for want of a Soul to hold them together. Therefore there
is nothing in this similitude, from whence to inferre a dependance of the Laity
on the Clergy, or of the Temporall Officers on the Spirituall; but of both on
the Civill Soveraign; which ought indeed to direct his Civill commands to the
Salvation of Souls; but is not therefore subject to any but God himselfe. And
thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first Argument, to deceive such men as
distinguish not between the Subordination of Actions in the way to the End; and
the Subjection of Persons one to another in the administration of the Means. For
to every End, the Means are determined by Nature, or by God himselfe
supernaturally: but the Power to make men use the Means, is in every nation
resigned (by the Law of Nature, which forbiddeth men to violate their Faith
given) to the Civill Soveraign.

{#126} His second Argument is this, _Every Common-wealth, (because it is
supposed to be perfect and sufficient in it self,) may command any other
Common-wealth, not subject to it, and force it to change the administration of
the Government; nay depose the Prince, and set another in his room, if it cannot
otherwise defend it selfe against the injuries he goes about to doe them: much
more may a Spirituall Common-wealth command a Temporall one to change the
administration of their Government, and may depose Princes, and institute
others, when they cannot otherwise defend the Spirituall Good_.

{#127} That a Common-wealth, to defend it selfe against injuries, may lawfully
doe all that he hath here said, is very true; and hath already in that which
hath gone before been sufficiently demonstrated. And if it were also true, that
there is now in this world a Spirituall Common-wealth, distinct from a Civill
Common-wealth, then might the Prince thereof, upon injury done him, or upon want
of caution that injury be not done him in time to come, repaire, and secure
himself by Warre; which is in summe, deposing, killing, or subduing, or doing
any act of Hostility. But by the same reason, it would be no lesse lawfull for a
Civill Soveraign, upon the like injuries done, or feared, to make warre upon the
Spirituall Soveraign; which I beleeve is more than Cardinall Bellarmine would
have inferred from his own proposition.

{#128} But Spirituall Common-wealth there is none in this world: for it is the
same thing with the Kingdome of Christ; which he himselfe saith, is not of this
world; but shall be in the next world, at the Resurrection, when they that have
lived justly, and beleeved that he was the Christ, shall (though they died
_Naturall_ bodies) rise _Spirituall_ bodies; and then it is, that our Saviour
shall judge the world, and conquer his Adversaries, and make a Spirituall
Common-wealth. In the mean time, seeing there are no men on earth, whose bodies
are Spirituall; there can be no Spirituall Common-wealth amongst men that are
yet in the flesh; unlesse wee call Preachers, that have Commission to Teach, and
prepare men for their reception into the Kingdome of Christ at the Resurrection,
a Common-wealth; which I have proved already to bee none.

{#129} The third Argument is this; _It is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate
an Infidel, or H{oe}reticall King, in case he endeavour to draw them to his
H{oe}resie, or Infidelity. But to judge whether a King draw his subjects to
H{oe}resie, or not, belongeth to the Pope. Therefore hath the Pope Right, to
determine whether the Prince be to be deposed, or not deposed_.

{#130} To this I answer, that both these assertions are false. For Christians,
(or men of what Religion soever,) if they tolerate not their King, whatsoever
law hee maketh, though it bee concerning Religion, doe violate their faith,
contrary to the Divine Law, both _Naturall_ and _Positive_: Nor is there any
Judge of H{ae}resie amongst Subjects, but their owne Civill Soveraign: For
_H{oe}resie is nothing else, but a private opinion, obstinately maintained,
contrary to the opinion which the Publique Person_ (that is to say, the
Representant of the Common-wealth) _hath commanded to bee taught_. By which it
is manifest, that an opinion publiquely appointed to bee taught, cannot be
H{ae}resie; nor the Soveraign Princes that authorize them, H{ae}retiques. For
H{ae}retiques are none but private men, that stubbornly defend some Doctrine,
prohibited by their lawfull Soveraigns.

{#131} But to prove that Christians are not to tolerate Infidell, or
H{ae}reticall Kings, he alledgeth a place in _Deut_. 17. where God forbiddeth
the Jews, when they shall set a King over themselves, to choose a stranger: And
from thence inferreth, that it is unlawfull for a Christian, to choose a King,
that is not a Christian. And 'tis true, that he that is a Christian, that is,
hee that hath already obliged himself to receive our Saviour when he shall come,
for his King, shal tempt God too much in choosing for King in this world, one
that hee knoweth will endeavour, both by terrour, and perswasion to make him
violate his faith. But, it is (saith hee) the same danger, to choose one that is
not a Christian, for King, and not to depose him, when hee is chosen. To this I
say, the question is not of the danger of not deposing; but of the Justice of
deposing him. To choose him, may in some cases bee unjust; but to depose him,
when he is chosen, is in no case Just. For it is alwaies violation of faith, and
consequently against the Law of Nature, which is the eternall Law of God. Nor
doe wee read, that any such Doctrine was accounted Christian in the time of the
Apostles; nor in the time of the Romane Emperours, till the Popes had the Civill
Soveraignty of Rome. But to this he hath replyed, that the Christians of old,
deposed not _Nero_, nor _Dioclesian_, nor _Julian_, nor _Valens_ an Arrian, for
this cause onely, that they wanted Temporall forces. Perhaps so. But did our
Saviour, who for calling for, might have had twelve Legions of immortall,
invulnerable Angels to assist him, want forces to depose _C{oe}sar_, or at least
_Pilate_, that unjustly, without finding fault in him, delivered him to the Jews
to bee crucified? Or if the Apostles wanted Temporall forces to depose _Nero_,
was it therefore necessary for them in their Epistles to the new made
Christians, to teach them (as they did) to obey the Powers constituted over
them, (whereof _Nero_ in that time was one,) and that they ought to obey them,
not for fear of their wrath, but for conscience sake? Shall we say they did not
onely obey, but also teach what they meant not, for want of strength? It is not
therefore for want of strength, but for conscience sake, that Christians are to
tolerate their Heathen Princes, or Princes (for I cannot call any one whose
Doctrine is the Publique Doctrine, an H{ae}retique) that authorize the teaching
of an Errour. And whereas for the Temporall Power of the Pope, he alledgeth
further, that St. Paul (1 _Cor_. 6.) appointed Judges under the Heathen Princes
of those times, such as were not ordained by those Princes; it is not true. For
St. Paul does but advise them, to take some of their Brethren to compound their
differences, as Arbitrators, rather than to goe to law one with another before
the Heathen Judges; which is a wholsome Precept, and full of Charity, fit to be
practised also in the best Christian Common-wealths. And for the danger that may
arise to Religion, by the Subjects tolerating of an Heathen, or an Erring
Prince, it is a point, of which a Subject is no competent Judge; or if bee bee,
the Popes Temporall Subjects may judge also of the Popes Doctrine. For every
Christian Prince, as I have formerly proved, is no lesse Supreme Pastor of his
own Subjects, than the Pope of his.

{#132} The fourth Argument, is taken from the Baptisme of Kings; wherein, that
they may be made Christians they submit their Scepters to Christ; and promise to
keep, and defend the Christian Faith. This is true; for Christian Kings are no
more but Christs Subjects: but they may, for all that, bee the Popes Fellowes;
for they are Supreme Pastors of their own Subjects; and the Pope is no more but
King, and Pastor, even in Rome it selfe.

{#133} The fifth Argument, is drawn from the words spoken by our Saviour, _Feed
my sheep_; by which was given all Power necessary for a Pastor; as the Power to
chase away Wolves, such as are H{ae}retiques; the Power to shut up Rammes, if
they be mad, or push at the other Sheep with their Hornes, such as are Evill
(though Christian) Kings; and Power to give the Flock convenient food: From
whence hee inferreth, that St. Peter had these three Powers given him by Christ.
To which I answer, that the last of these Powers, is no more than the Power, or
rather Command to Teach. For the first, which is to chase away Wolves, that is,
H{ae}retiques, the place hee quoteth is (_Matth_. 7. 15.) _Beware of false
Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening
Wolves_. But neither are H{ae}retiques false Prophets, or at all Prophets: nor
(admitting H{ae}retiques for the Wolves there meant,) were the Apostles
commanded to kill them, or if they were Kings, to depose them; but to beware of,
fly, and avoid them: nor was it to St. Peter, nor to any of the Apostles, but to
the multitude of the Jews that followed him into the mountain, men for the most
part not yet converted, that hee gave this Counsell, to Beware of false
Prophets: which therefore if it conferre a Power of chasing away Kings, was
given, not onely to private men; but to men that were not at all Christians. And
as to the Power of Separating, and Shutting up of furious Rammes, (by which hee
meaneth Christian Kings that refuse to submit themselves to the Roman Pastor,)
our Saviour refused to take upon him that Power in this world himself, but
advised to let the Corn and Tares grow up together till the day of Judgment:
much lesse did hee give it to St. Peter, or can S. Peter give it to the Popes.
St. Peter, and all other Pastors, are bidden to esteem those Christians that
disobey the Church, that is, (that disobey the Christian Soveraigne) as Heathen
men, and as Publicans. Seeing then men challenge to the Pope no authority over
Heathen Princes, they ought to challenge none over those that are to bee
esteemed as Heathen.

{#134} But from the Power to Teach onely, hee inferreth also a Coercive Power in
the Pope, over Kings. The Pastor (saith he) must give his flock convenient food:
Therefore the Pope may, and ought to compell Kings to doe their duty. Out of
which it followeth, that the Pope, as Pastor of Christian men, is King of Kings:
which all Christian Kings ought indeed either to Confesse, or else they ought to
take upon themselves the Supreme Pastorall Charge, every one in his own
Dominion.

{#135} His sixth, and last Argument, is from Examples. To which I answer, first,
that Examples prove nothing: Secondly, that the Examples he alledgeth make not
so much as a probability of Right. The fact of Jehoiada, in Killing Athaliah (2
_Kings_ 11.) was either by the Authority of King Joash, or it was a horrible
Crime in the High Priest, which (ever after the election of King Saul) was a
mere Subject. The fact of St. Ambrose, in Excommunicating Theodosius the
Emperour, (if it were true hee did so,) was a Capitall Crime. And for the Popes,
Gregory 1. Greg. 2. Zachary, and Leo 3. their Judgments are void, as given in
their own Cause; and the Acts done by them conformably to this Doctrine, are the
greatest Crimes (especially that of Zachary) that are incident to Humane Nature.
And thus much of _Power Ecclesiasticall_; wherein I had been more briefe,
forbearing to examine these Arguments of Bellarmine, if they had been his, as a
Private man, and not as the Champion of the Papacy, against all other Christian
Princes, and States.
