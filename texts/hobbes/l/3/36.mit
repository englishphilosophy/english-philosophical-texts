£1 _Of the ^Word of God^, and of ^Prophets^._ £1

{#1} #_Word what._# ^When^ there is mention of the _Word of God_, or of _Man_,
it doth not signifie a part of Speech, such as Grammarians call a Nown, or a
Verb, or any simple voice, without a contexture with other words to make it
significative; but a perfect Speech or Discourse, whereby the speaker
_affirmeth, denieth, commandeth, promiseth, threatneth, wisheth_, or
_interrogateth_. In which sense it is not _Vocabulum_, that signifies a _Word_;
but _Sermo_, (in Greek λόγος) that is, some _Speech, Discourse_, or _Saying_.

{#2} Again, if we say the Word of God, or of Man, it may#_The words spoken by
God, and concerning God, both are called Gods Word in Scripture._# bee
understood sometimes of the Speaker, (as the words that God hath spoken, or that
a Man hath spoken: In which sense, when we say, the Gospel of St. Matthew, we
understand St. Matthew to be the Writer of it: and sometimes of the Subject: In
which sense, when we read in the Bible, _The words of the days of the Kings of
Israel, or Judah_, 'tis meant, that the acts that were done in those days, were
the Subject of those Words; And in the Greek, which (in the Scripture) retaineth
many Hebraismes, by the Word of God is oftentimes meant, not that which is
spoken by God, but concerning God, and his government; that is to say, the
Doctrine of Religion: Insomuch, as it is all one, to say λόγος Θεοuivrgr and
_Theologia_; which is, that Doctrine which wee usually call _Divinity_, as is
manifest by the places following [_Acts_ 13. 46.] _Then Paul and Barnabas waxed
bold, and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should first have been
spoken to you, but seeing you put it from you, and judge your selves unworthy of
everlasting life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles_. That which is here called the
Word of God, was the Doctrine of Christian Religion; as it appears evidently by
that which goes before. And [_Acts_ 5. 20.] where it is said to the Apostles by
an Angel, _Go stand and speak in the Temple, all the Words of this life_; by the
Words of this life, is meant, the Doctrine of the Gospel; as is evident by what
they did in the Temple, and is expressed in the last verse of the same Chap.
_Daily in the Temple, and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach
Christ Jesus_: In which place it is manifest, that Jesus Christ was the subject
of this _Word of life_; or (which is all one) the subject of the _Words of this
life eternall_, that our Saviour offered them. So [_Acts_ 15. 7.] the Word of
God, is called _the Word of the Gospel_, because it containeth the Doctrine of
the Kingdome of Christ; and the same Word [_Rom_. 10. 8, 9.] is called _the Word
of Faith_; that is, as is there expressed, the Doctrine of Christ come, and
raised from the dead. Also[_Mat_. 13. 19.] _When any one heareth the Word of the
Kingdome_; that is, the Doctrine of the Kingdome taught by Christ. Again, the
same Word, is said [_Acts_ 12. 24.] _to grow and to be multiplyed_; which to
understand of the Evangelicall Doctrine is easie, but of the Voice, or Speech of
God, hard and strange. In the same sense the _Doctrine of Devils_, signifieth
not the Words of any Devill, but the Doctrine of Heathen#_1 Tim. 4. 1._# men
concerning _D{ae}mons_, and those Phantasms which they worshipped as Gods.

{#3} Considering these two significations of the ^Word of^ ^God^, as it is taken
in Scripture, it is manifest in this later sense (where it is taken for the
Doctrine of Christian Religion,) that the whole Scripture is the Word of God:
but in the former sense not so. For example, though these words, _I am the Lord
thy God, &c_. to the end of the Ten Commandements, were spoken by God to Moses;
yet the Preface, _God spake these words and said_, is to be understood for the
Words of him that wrote the holy History. The _Word of God_, as it is taken for
that which he hath spoken, is#_The Word of God metaphorically used, first, for
the Decrees and Power of God._# nderstood sometimes _Properly_, sometimes
_Metaphorically. Properly_, as the words, he hath spoken to his Prophets:
_Metaphorically_, for his Wisdome, Power, and eternall Decree, in making the
world; in which sense, those _Fiats, Let their be light, Let there be a
firmament, Let us make man, &c_. [_Gen_. 1.] are the Word of God. And in the
same sense it is said [_John_ 1. 3.] _All things were made by it, and without it
was nothing made that was made_: And [_Heb_. 1. 3.] _He upholdeth all things by
the Word of his Power_; that is, by the Power of his Word; that is, by his
Power: and [_Heb_. 11. 3.] _The worlds were framed by the Word of God_; and many
other places to the same sense: As also amongst the Latines, the name of _Fate_,
which signifieth properly _The word spoken_, is taken in the same sense.

{#4} #_Secondly, for the effect of his Word._# Secondly, for the effect of his
Word; that is to say, for the thing it self, which by his Word is Affirmed,
Commanded, Threatned, or Promised; as [_Psalm_ 105. 19.] where Joseph is said to
have been kept in prison, _till his Word was come_; that is, till that was come
to passe which he had [_Gen_. 40. 13.] foretold to Pharaohs Butler, concerning
his being restored to his office: for there by _his word was come_, is meant,
the thing it self was come to passe. So also [1 _King_. 18. 36.] Elijah saith to
God, _I have done all these thy Words_, in stead of _I have done all these
things at thy Word_, or commandement: and [_Jer_. 17. 15.] _Where is the Word of
the Lord_, is put for, _Where is the Evill he threatned_: And [_Ezek_. 12. 28.]
_There shall none of my Words be prolonged any more_: by _words_ are understood
those _things_, which God promised to his people. And in the New Testament
[_Mat_. 24. 35.] _heaven and earth shal pass away, but my Words shal not pass
away_; that is, there is nothing that I have promised or foretold, that shall
not come to passe. And in this sense it is, that St. John the Evangelist, and, I
think, St. John onely calleth our Saviour himself as in the flesh _the Word of
God_ [as _Joh_. 1. 14.] _the Word was made Flesh_; that is to say, the Word, or
Promise that Christ should come into the world; _who in the beginning was with
God_; that is to say, it was in the purpose of God the Father, to send God the
Son into the world, to enlighten men in the way of Eternall life; but it was not
till then put in execution, and actually incarnate; So that our Saviour is there
called _the Word_, not because he was the promise, but the thing promised. They
that taking occasion from this place, doe commonly call him the Verbe of God, do
but render the text more obscure. They might as well term him the Nown of God:
for as by _Nown_, so also by _Verbe_, men understand nothing but a part of
speech, a voice, a sound, that neither affirms, nor denies, nor commands, nor
promiseth, nor is any substance corporeall, or spirituall; and therefore it
cannot be said to bee either God, or Man; whereas our Saviour is both. And this
_Word_ which St. _John_ in his Gospel saith was with God, is [in his 1 Epistle,
verse 1.] called the _Word of life_; and [verse 2.] _the Eternall life, which
was with the Father_: so that he can be in no other sense called the _Word_,
then in that, wherein he is called Eternall life; that is, _he that hath
procured us Eternall life_, by his comming in the flesh. So also [_Apocalypse_
19. 13.] the Apostle speaking of Christ, clothed in a garment dipt in bloud,
faith; his name is _the Word of God_; which is to be understood, as if he had
said his name had been, _He that was come according to the purpose of God from
the beginning, and according to his Word and promises delivered by the
Prophets_. So that there is nothing here of the Incarnation of a Word, but of
the Incarnation of God the Son,#_Acts 1. 4. Luke 24. 49._# herefore called _the
Word_, because his Incarnation was the Performance of the Promise; In like
manner as the Holy Ghost is called _the Promise_.

{#5} #_Thirdly, for the words of reason and equity._# There are also places of
the Scripture, where, by the _Word of God_, is signified such Words as are
consonant to reason, and equity, though spoken sometimes neither by Prophet, nor
by a holy man. For Pharaoh Necho was an Idolater; yet his Words to the good King
Josiah, in which he advised him by Messengers, not to oppose him in his march
against _Carchemish_, are said to have proceeded from the mouth of God; and that
Josiah not hearkning to them, was slain in the battle; as is to be read 2
_Chron_. 35. vers. 21, 22, 23. It is true, that as the same History is related
in the first Book of Esdras, not Pharaoh, but Jeremiah spake these words to
Josiah, from the mouth of the Lord. But wee are to give credit to the Canonicall
Scripture, whatsoever be written in the Apocrypha.

{#6} The _Word of God_, is then also to be taken for the Dictates of reason, and
equity, when the same is said in the Scriptures to bee written in mans heart; as
_Psalm_ 36. 31. _Jerem_. 31. 33. _Deut_. 30. 11, 14. and many other like places.

{#7} #_Divers acceptions of the word Prophet._# The name of ^Prophet^,
signifieth in Scripture sometimes _Prolocutor_; that is, he that speaketh from
God to Man, or from man to God: And sometimes _Pr{oe}dictor_, or a foreteller of
things to come: And sometimes one that speaketh incoherently, as men that are
distracted. It is most frequently used in the sense of speaking from God to the
People. So _Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah_, and others were
_Prophets_. And in this sense the High Priest was a _Prophet_, for he only went
into the _Sanctum Sanctorum_, to enquire of God; and was to declare his answer
to the people. And therefore when Caiphas said, it was expedient that one man
should die for the people, St. John saith [chap. 11. 51.] that _He spake not
this of himselfe, but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that one man
should dye for the nation_. Also they that in Christian Congregations taught the
people [1 _Cor_. 14. 3.] are said to Prophecy. In the like sense it is, that God
saith to _Moses_ [_Exod_. 4. 16.] concerning _Aaron, He shall be thy Spokes-man
to the People; and he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead
of God_: that which here is _Spokes-man_, is [chap. 7. 1.] interpreted Prophet;
_See_ (saith God) _I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother
shall be thy Prophet_. In the sense of speaking from man to God Abraham is
called a Prophet [_Genes_. 20. 7.] where God in a Dream speaketh to Abimelech in
this manner, _Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and
shall pray for thee_; whereby may be also gathered, that the name of Prophet may
be given, not unproperly to them that in Christian Churches, have a Calling to
say publique prayers for the Congregation. In the same sense, the Prophets that
came down from the High place (or Hill of God) with a Psaltery, and a Tabret,
and a Pipe, and a Harp [1 _Sam_. 10. 5, 6.] and [vers. 10.] Saul amongst them,
are said to Prophecy, in that they praised God, in that manner publiquely. In
the like sense, is Miriam [_Exod_. 15. 20.] called a Prophetesse. So is it also
to be taken [1 _Cor_. 11. 4, 5.] where St. Paul saith, _Every man that prayeth
or prophecyeth with his head covered, &c. and every woman that prayeth or
prophecyeth with her head uncovered_: For Prophecy in that place, signifieth no
more, but praising God in Psalmes, and Holy Songs; which women might doe in the
Church, though it were not lawfull for them to speak to the Congregation. And in
this signification it is, that the Poets of the Heathen, that composed Hymnes
and other sorts of Poems in the honor of their Gods, were called _Vates_
(Prophets) as is well enough known by all that are versed in the Books of the
Gentiles, and as is evident [_Tit_. 1. 12.] where St. Paul saith of the
Cretians, that a Prophet of their owne said, they were Liars; not that St. Paul
held their Poets for Prophets, but acknowledgeth that the word Prophet was
commonly used to signifie them that celebrated the honour of God in Verse.

{#8} #_Pr{ae}diction of future contingents, not alwaies Prophecy._# When by
Prophecy is meant Pr{ae}diction, or foretelling of future Contigents; not only
they were Prophets, who were Gods Spokes-men, and foretold those things to
others, which God had foretold to them; but also all those Impostors, that
pretend by the helpe of familiar spirits, or by superstitious divination of
events past, from false causes, to foretell the like events in time to come: of
which (as I have declared already in the 12. chapter of this Discourse) there be
many kinds, who gain in the opinion of the common sort of men, a greater
reputation of Prophecy, by one casuall event that may bee but wrested to their
purpose, than can be lost again by never so many failings. Prophecy is not an
Art, nor (when it is taken for Pr{ae}diction) a constant Vocation; but an
extraordinary, and temporary Employment from God, most often of Good men, but
sometimes also of the Wicked. The woman of Endor, who is said to have had a
familiar spirit, and thereby to have raised a Phantasme of Samuel, and foretold
Saul his death, was not therefore a Prophetesse; for neither had she any
science, whereby she could raise such a Phantasme; nor does it appear that God
commanded the raising of it; but onely guided that Imposture to be a means of
Sauls terror and discouragement; and by consequent, of the discomfiture, by
which he fell. And for Incoherent Speech, it was amongst the Gentiles taken for
one sort of Prophecy, because the Prophets of their Oracles, intoxicated with a
spirit, or vapor from the cave of the Pythian Oracle at Delphi, were for the
time really mad, and spake like madmen; of whose loose words a sense might be
made to fit any event, in such sort, as all bodies are said to be made of
_Materia prima_. In the Scripture I find it also so taken [1 _Sam_. 18. 10.] in
these words, _And the Evill spirit came upon Saul, and he Prophecyed in the
midst of the house_.

{#9} #_The manner how God hath spoken to the Prophets._# And although there be
so many significations in Scripture of the word _Prophet_; yet is that the most
frequent, in which it is taken for him, to whom God speaketh immediately, that
which the Prophet is to say from him, to some other man, or to the people. And
hereupon a question may be asked, in what manner God speaketh to such a Prophet.
Can it (may some say) be properly said, that God hath voice and language, when
it cannot be properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a man? The
Prophet David argueth thus, _Shall he that made the eye, not see_? _or he that
made the ear, not hear_? But this may be spoken, not (as usually) to signifie
Gods nature, but to signifie our intention to honor him. For to _see_, and
_hear_, are Honorable Attributes, and may be given to God, to declare (as far as
our capacity can conceive) his Almighty power. But if it were to be taken in the
strict, and proper sense, one might argue from his making of all other parts of
mans body, that he had also the same use of them which we have; which would be
many of them so uncomely, as it would be the greatest contumely in the world to
ascribe them to him. Therefore we are to interpret Gods speaking to men
immediately, for that way (whatsoever it be), by which God makes them understand
his will: And the wayes whereby he doth this, are many; and to be sought onely
in the Holy Scripture: where though many times it be said, that God spake to
this, and that person, without declaring in what manner; yet there be again many
places, that deliver also the signes by which they were to acknowledge his
presence, and commandement; and by these may be understood, how he spake to many
of the rest.

{#10} In what manner God spake to _Adam_, and _Eve_,#_To the Extraordinary
Prophets of the Old Testament he spake by Dreams, or Visions._# and _Cain_, and
_Noah_, is not expressed; nor how he spake to _Abraham_, till such time as he
came out of his own countrey to _Sichem_ in the land of _Canaan_; and then
[_Gen_. 12. 7.] God is said to have _appeared_ to him. So there is one way,
whereby God made his presence manifest; that is, by an _Apparition_, or
_Vision_. And again, [_Gen_. 15. 1.] The Word of the Lord came to Abraham in a
Vision; that is to say, somewhat, as a sign of Gods presence, appeared as Gods
Messenger, to speak to him. Again, the Lord appeared to Abraham [_Gen_. 18. 1.]
by an apparition of three Angels; and to Abimelech [_Gen_. 20. 3.] in a dream:
To Lot [_Gen_. 19. 1.] by an apparition of two Angels: And to Hagar [_Gen_. 21.
17.] by the apparition of one Angel: And to Abraham again [_Gen_. 22. 11.] by
the apparition of a voice from heaven: And [_Gen_. 26. 24.] to Isaac in the
night; (that is, in his sleep, or by dream): And to Jacob [_Gen_. 18. 12.] in a
dream; that is to say (as are the words of the text) _Jacob dreamed that he saw
a ladder, &c_. And [_Gen_. 32. 1.] in a Vision of Angels: And to Moses [_Exod_.
3. 2.] in the apparition of a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: And
after the time of Moses, (where the manner how God spake immediately to man in
the Old Testament, is expressed) hee spake alwaies by a Vision, or by a Dream;
as to _Gideon, Samuel, Eliah, Elisha, Isaiah, Ezekiel_, and the rest of the
Prophets; and often in the New Testament, as to _Joseph_, to St. _Peter_, to St.
_Paul_, and to St. _John_ the Evangelist in the Apocalypse.

{#11} Onely to Moses hee spake in a more extraordinary manner in Mount _Sinai_,
and in the _Tabernacle_; and to the High Priest in the _Tabernacle_, and in the
_Sanctum Sanctorum_ of the Temple. But Moses, and after him the High Priests
were Prophets of a more eminent place, and degree in Gods favour; And God
himself in express words declareth, that to other Prophets hee spake in Dreams
and Visions, but to his servant Moses, in such manner as a man speaketh to his
friend. The words are these [_Numb_. 12. 6, 7, 8.] _If there be a Prophet among
you, I the Lord will make my self known to him in a Vision, and will speak unto
him in a Dream. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all my house;
with him I will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, not in dark speeches; and
the similitude of the Lord shall he behold_. And [_Exod_. 33. 11.] _The Lord
spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend_. And yet this
speaking of God to Moses, was by mediation of an Angel, or Angels, as appears
expressely, _Acts_ 7. ver. 35. and 53. and _Gal_. 3. 19. and was therefore a
Vision, though a more cleer Vision than was given to other Prophets, And
conformable hereunto, where God saith (_Deut_. 13. 1.) _If there arise amongst
you a Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams_, the later word is but the interpretation
of the former. And [_Joel_ 2. 28.] _Your sons and your daughters shall Prophecy;
your old men shall dream Dreams, and your young men shall see Visions_: where
again, the word _Prophecy_ is expounded by _Dream_, and _Vision_. And in the
same manner it was, that God spake to Solomon, promising him Wisdome, Riches,
and Honor; for the text saith, [1 _Kings_ 3. 15.] _And Solomon awoak, and behold
it was a Dream_: So that generally the Prophets extraordinary in the Old
Testament took notice of the Word of God no otherwise, than from their Dreams,
or Visions; that is to say, from the imaginations which they had in their sleep,
or in an Extasie: which imaginations in every true Prophet were supernaturall;
but in false Prophets were either naturall, or feigned.

{#12} The same Prophets were neverthelesse said to speak by the Spirit; as
[_Zach_. 7. 12.] where the Prophet speaking of the Jewes, saith, _They made
their hearts hard as A damant, lest they should hear the law, and the words
which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his Spirit by the former Prophets_. By
which it is manifest, that speaking by the _Spirit_, or _Inspiration_, was not a
particular manner of Gods speaking, different from Vision, when they that were
said to speak by the Spirit, were extraordinary Prophets, such as for every new
message, were to have a particular Commission, or (which is all one) a new
Dream, or Vision.

{#13} Of Prophets, that were so by a perpetuall Calling in#_To Prophets of
perpetuall Calling, and Supreme, God spake in the Old Testament from the Mercy
Seat, in a manner not expressed in the Scripture._# the Old Testament, some were
_supreme_, and some _subordinate_: Supreme were first Moses; and after him the
High Priests, every one for his time, as long as the Priesthood was Royall; and
after the people of the Jews, had rejected God, that he should no more reign
over them, those Kings which submitted themselves to Gods government, were also
his chief Prophets; and the High Priests office became Ministeriall. And when
God was to be consulted, they put on the holy vestments, and enquired of the
Lord, as the King commanded them, and were deprived of their office, when the
King thought fit. For King Saul [1 _Sam_. 13. 9.] commanded the burnt offering
to be brought, and [1 _Sam_. 14. 18.] he commands the Priest to bring the Ark
neer him; and [ver. 19.] again to let it alone, because he saw an advantage upon
his enemies. And in the same chapter Saul asketh counsell of God. In like manner
King David, after his being anointed, though before he had possession of the
Kingdome, is said to _enquire of the Lord_ [1 _Sam_. 23. 2.] whether he should
fight against the Philistines at _Keilah_; and [verse 10.] David commandeth the
Priest to bring him the Ephod, to enquire whether he should stay in _Keilah_, or
not. And King Solomon [1 _Kings_ 2. 27.] took the Priesthood from _Abiathar_,
and gave it [verse 35.] to _Zadoc_. Therefore Moses, and the High Priests, and
the pious Kings, who enquired of God on all extraordinary occasions, how they
were to carry themselves, or what event they were to have, were all Soveraign
Prophets. But in what manner God spake unto them, is not manifest. To say that
when Moses went up to God in Mount _Sinai_, it was a Dream, or Vision, such as
other Prophets had, is contrary to that distinction which God made between
Moses, and other Prophets, _Numb_. 12. 6, 7, 8. To say God spake or appeared as
he is in his own nature, is to deny his Infinitenesse, Invisibility,
Incomprehensibility. To say he spake by Inspiration, or Infusion of the Holy
Spirit, as the Holy Spirit signifieth the Deity, is to make Moses equall with
Christ, in whom onely the Godhead [as St. Paul speaketh _Col_. 2. 9.] dwelleth
bodily. And lastly, to say he spake by the Holy Spirit, as it signifieth the
graces, or gifts of the Holy Spirit, is to attribute nothing to him
supernaturall. For God disposeth men to Piety, Justice, Mercy, Truth, Faith, and
all manner of Vertue, both Morall, and Intellectuall, by doctrine, example, and
by severall occasions, naturall, and ordinary.

{#14} And as these ways cannot be applyed to God, in his speaking to Moses, at
Mount _Sinai_; so also, they cannot be applyed to him, in his speaking to the
High Priests, from the Mercy-Seat. Therefore in what manner God spake to those
Soveraign Prophets of the Old Testament, whose office it was to enquire of him,
is not intelligible. In the time of the New Testament, there was no Soveraign
Prophet, but our Saviour; who was both God that spake, and the Prophet to whom
he spake.

{#15} #_To Prophets of perpetuall Calling, but subordinate, God spake by the
Spirit._# To subordinate Prophets of perpetuall Calling, I find not any place
that proveth God spake to them supernaturally; but onely in such manner, as
naturally he inclineth men to Piety, to Beleef, to Righteousnesse, and to other
vertues all other Christian men. Which way, though it consist in Constitution,
Instruction, Education, and the occasions and invitements men have to Christian
vertues; yet it is truly attributed to the operation of the Spirit of God, or
Holy Spirit, (which we in our language call the Holy Ghost): For there is no
good inclination, that is not of the operation of God. But these operations are
not alwaies supernaturall. When therefore a Prophet is said to speak in the
Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, we are to understand no more, but that he
speaks according to Gods will, declared by the supreme Prophet. For the most
common acceptation of the word Spirit, is in the signification of a mans
intention, mind, or disposition.

{#16} In the time of Moses, there were seventy men besides himself, that
_Prophecyed_ in the Campe of the Israelites. In what manner God spake to them,
is declared in the 11 of _Numbers_, verse 25. _The Lord came down in a cloud,
and spake unto Moses, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and gave it to
the seventy Elders. And it came to passe, when the Spirit rested upon them, they
Prophecyed, and did not cease_. By which it is manifest, first, that their
Prophecying to the people, was subservient, and subordinate to the Prophecying
of Moses; for that God took of the Spirit of Moses, to put upon them; so that
they Prophecyed as Moses would have them: otherwise they had not been suffered
to Prophecy at all. For there was [verse 27.] a complaint made against them to
Moses; and Joshua would have Moses to have forbidden them; which he did not, but
said to Joshua, Bee not jealous in my behalf. Secondly, that the Spirit of God
in that place, signifieth nothing but the Mind and Disposition to obey, and
assist Moses in the administration of the Government. For if it were meant they
had the substantiall Spirit of God; that is, the Divine nature, inspired into
them, then they had it in no lesse manner then Christ himself, in whom onely the
Spirit of God dwelt bodily. It is meant therefore of the Gift and Grace of God,
that guided them to co-operate with Moses; from whom their Spirit was derived.
And it appeareth [verse 16.] that, they were such as Moses himself should
appoint for Elders and Officers of the People: For the words are, _Gather unto
me seventy men, whom thou knowest to be Elders and Officers of the people_:
where, _thou knowest_, is the same with _thou appointest_, or _hast appointed to
be such_. For we are told before [_Exod_. 18.] that Moses following the counsell
of Jethro his Father-in-law, did appoint Judges, and Officers over the people,
such as feared God; and of these, were those Seventy, whom God by putting upon
them Moses spirit, inclined to aid Moses in the Administration of the Kingdome:
and in this sense the Spirit of God is said [1 _Sam_. 16. 13, 14.] presently
upon the anointing of David, to have come upon David, and left Saul; God giving
his graces to him he chose to govern his people, and taking them away from him,
he rejected. So that by the Spirit is meant Inclination to Gods service; and not
any supernaturall Revelation.

{#17} #_God sometimes also spake by Lots._# God spake also many times by the
event of Lots; which were ordered by such as he had put in Authority over his
people. So wee read that God manifested by the Lots which Saul caused to be
drawn [1 _Sam_. 14. 43.] the fault that Jonathan had committed, in eating a
honey-comb, contrary to the oath taken by the people. And (_Josh_. 18. 10.] God
divided the land of Canaan amongst the Israelite, by the _lots that Joshua did
cast before the Lord in Shiloh_. In the same manner it seemeth to be, that God
discovered [_Joshua_ 7. 16, &_c_.] the crime of Achan. And these are the wayes
whereby God declared his Will in the Old Testament.

{#18} All which ways he used also in the New Testament. To the _Virgin Mary_, by
a Vision of an Angel: To _Joseph_ in a Dream: again to _Paul_ in the way to
Damascus in a Vision of our Saviour: and to _Peter_ in the Vision of a sheet let
down from heaven, with divers sorts of flesh, of clean, and unclean beasts; and
in prison, by Vision of an Angel: And to all the Apostles, and Writers of the
New Testament, by the graces of his Spirit; and to the Apostles again (at the
choosing of Matthias in the place of Judas Iscariot) by lot.

{#19} #_Every man ought to examine the probability of a pretended Prophets
Calling._# Seeing then all Prophecy supposeth Vision, or Dream, (which two, when
they be naturall, are the same,) or some especiall gift of God, so rarely
observed in mankind, as to be admired where observed; And seeing as well such
gifts, as the most extraordinary Dreams, and Visions, may proceed from God, not
onely by his supernaturall, and immediate, but also by his naturall operation,
and by mediation of second causes; there is need of Reason and Judgment to
discern between naturall, and supernaturall Gifts, and between naturall, and
supernaturall Visions, or Dreams. And consequently men had need to be very
circumspect, and wary, in obeying the voice of man, that pretending himself to
be a Prophet, requires us to obey God in that way, which he in Gods name telleth
us to be the way to happinesse. For he that pretends to teach men the way of so
great felicity, pretends to govern them; that is to say, to rule, and reign over
them; which is a thing, that all men naturally desire, and is therefore worthy
to be suspected of Ambition and Imposture; and consequently, ought to be
examined, and tryed by every man, before hee yeeld them obedience; unlesse he
have yeelded it them already, in the institution of a Common-wealth; as when the
Prophet is the Civill Soveraign, or by the Civil Soveraign Authorized. And if
this examination of Prophets, and Spirits, were not allowed to every one of the
people, it had been to no purpose, to set out the marks, by which every man
might be able, to distinguish between those, whom they ought, and those whom
they ought not to follow. Seeing therefore such marks are set out (_Deut_. 13.
1, &c.] to know a Prophet by; and [1 _John_ 4. 1. &c.] to know a Spirit by: and
seeing there is so much Prophecying in the Old Testament; and so much Preaching
in the New Testament against Prophets; and so much greater a number ordinarily
of false Prophets, then of true; every one is to beware of obeying their
directions, at their own perill. And first, that there were many more false then
true Prophets, appears by this, that when Ahab [I _Kings_ 12.] consulted four
hundred Prophets, they were all false Impostors, but onely one Michaiah. And a
little before the time of the Captivity, the Prophets were generally lyars. _The
Prophets_ (saith the Lord by _Jeremy_, cha. 14, verse 14.) _prophecy Lies in my
name. I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor spake unto them, they
prophecy to you a false Vision, a thing of naught; and the deceit of their
heart_. In so much as God commanded the People by the mouth of the Prophet
_Jeremiah_ [chap. 23. 16.] not to obey them. _Thus saith the Lord of Hosts,
hearken not unto the words of the Prophets, that prophecy to you. They make you
vain, they speak a Vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the
Lord_.

{#20} #_All prophecy but of the Soveraign Prophet is to be examined by every
Subject._# Seeing then there was in the time of the Old Testament, such
quarrells amongst the Visionary Prophets, one contesting with another, and
asking, When departed the Spirit from me, to go to thee? as between Michaiah,
and the rest of the four hundred; and such giving of the Lye to one another, (as
in _Jerem_. 14. 14.) and such controversies in the New Testament at this day,
amongst the Spirituall Prophets: Every man then was, and now is bound to make
use of his Naturall Reason, to apply to all Prophecy those Rules which God hath
given us, to discern the true from the false. Of which Rules, in the Old
Testament, one was, conformable doctrine to that which Moses the Soveraign
Prophet had taught them; and the other the miraculous power of foretelling what
God would bring to passe, as I have already shewn out of _Deut_. 13. I. &_c_.
And in the New Testament there was but one onely mark; and that was the
preaching of this Doctrine, _That Jesus is the Christ_, that is, the King of the
Jews, promised in the Old Testament. Whosoever denyed that Article, he was a
false Prophet, whatsoever miracles he might seem to work; and he that taught it
was a true Prophet. For St. _John_ [I Epist. 4. 2, &c.] speaking expressely of
the means to examine Spirits, whether they be of God, or not; after he had told
them that there would arise false Prophets, saith thus, _Hereby know ye the
Spirit of God. Every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh, is of God_; that is, is approved and allowed as a Prophet of God: not
that he is a godly man, or one of the Elect, for this, that he confesseth,
professeth, or preacheth Jesus to be the Christ; but for that he is a Prophet
avowed. For God sometimes speaketh by Prophets, whose persons he hath not
accepted; as he did by Baalam; and as he foretold Saul of his death, by the
Witch of Endor. Again in the next verse, _Every Spirit that confesseth not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of Christ. And this is the Spirit of
Antichrist_. So that the Rule is perfect on both sides; that he is a true
Prophet, which preacheth the Messiah already come, in the person of Jesus; and
he a false one that denyeth him come, and looketh for him in some future
Impostor, that shall take upon him that honour falsely, whom the Apostle there
properly calleth Antichrist. Every man therefore ought to consider who is the
Soveraign Prophet; that is to say, who it is, that is Gods Vicegerent on Earth;
and hath next under God, the Authority of Governing Christian men; and to
observe for a Rule, that Doctrine, which in the name of God, hee hath commanded
to bee taught; and thereby to examine and try out the truth of those Doctrines,
which pretended Prophets with miracle, or without, shall at any time advance:
and if they find it contrary to that Rule, to doe as they did, that came to
Moses, and complained that there were some that Prop[h]ecyed in the Campe, whose
Authority so to doe they doubted of; and leave to the Soveraign, as they did to
Moses to uphold, or to forbid them, as hee should see cause; and if hee disavow
them, then no more to obey their voice; or if he approve them, then to obey
them, as men to whom God hath given a part of the Spirit of their Soveraigne.
For when Christian men, take not their Christian Soveraign, for Gods Prophet;
they must either take their owne Dreames, for the Prophecy they mean to bee
governed by, and the tumour of their own hearts for the Spirit of God; or they
must suffer themselves to bee lead by some strange Prince; or by some of their
fellow subjects, that can bewitch them, by slaunder of the government, into
rebellion, without other miracle to confirm their calling, then sometimes an
extraordinary successe, and Impunity; and by this means destroying all laws,
both divine, and humane, reduce all Order, Government, and Society, to the first
Chaos of Violence, and Civill warre.
