£1 _Of ^Persons^, ^Authors^, and things Personated._ £1

{#1} #_A person what._# ^A Person^, is he, _whose words or actions are
considered, either as his own, or as representing the words or actions of an
other man, or of any other thing to whom they are attributed, whether Truly or
by Fiction_.

{#2} When they are considered as his owne, then is he called##_Person Naturall
and Artificiall._## a _Naturall Person_: And when they are considered as
representing the words and actions of an other, then is he a _Feigned_ or
_Artificiall person_.

{#3} The word Person is latine: insteed whereof the Greeks##_The word Person,
whence._## have πρόσωπον which signifies the _Face_, as _Persona_ in latine
signifies the _disguise_, or _outward appearance_ of a man, counterfeited on the
Stage; and somtimes more particularly that part of it, which disguiseth the
face, as a Mask or Visard: And from the Stage, hath been translated to any
Representer of speech and action, as well in Tribunalls, as Theaters. So that a
_Person_, is the same that an _Actor_ is, both on the Stage and in common
Conversation; and to _Personate_, is to _Act_, or _Represent_ himselfe, or an
other; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his Person, or act in his
name; (in which sence _Cicero_ useth it where he saies, _Unus sustineo tres
Personas; Mei, Adversarii, & Judicis_, I beare three Persons; my own, my
Adversaries, and the Judges;) and is called in diverse occasions, diversly; as a
_Representer_, or _Representative_, a _Lieutenant_, a _Vicar_, an _Attorney_, a
_Deputy_, a _Procurator_, an _Actor_, and the like.

{#4} Of Persons Artificiall, some have their words and actions _Owned_ by those
whom they represent. And then the Person is the _Actor_; and he that owneth his
words#_Actor,_# and actions, is the ^Author^: In which case the
Actor#_Actor,_# acteth by Authority. For that which in speaking of goods and
possessions, is called an _Owner_, and in latine _Dominus_, in Greeke κύριος;
speaking of Actions, is called Author. And as the Right of possession, is called
Dominion; so the Right of doing any Action, is called#_Authority._#
^Authority^. So that by Authority, is alwayes understood a Right of doing any
act: and _done by Authority_, done by Commission, or Licence from him whose
right it is.

{#5} #_Covenants by Authority, bind the Author._# From hence it followeth,
that when the Actor maketh a Covenant by Authority, he bindeth thereby the
Author, no lesse than if he had made it himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to
all the consequences of the same. And therfore all that hath been said formerly,
(_Chap_. 14.) of the nature of Covenants between man and man in their naturall
capacity, is true also when they are made by their Actors, Representers, or
Procurators, that have authority from them, so far-forth as is in their
Commission, but no farther.

{#6} And therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor, or Representer, not
knowing the Authority he hath, doth it at his own perill. For no man is obliged
by a Covenant, whereof he is not Author; nor consequently by a Covenant made
against, or beside the Authority he gave.

{#7} #_But not the Actor._# When the Actor doth any thing against the Law of
Nature by command of the Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey
him, not he, but the Author breaketh the Law of Nature: for though the Action be
against the Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but contrarily, to refuse to do
it, is against the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth breach of Covenant.

{#8} #_The Authority is to be shewne._# And he that maketh a Covenant with the
Author, by mediation of the Actor, not knowing what Authority he hath, but onely
takes his word; in case such Authority be not made manifest unto him upon
demand, is no longer obliged: For the Covenant made with the Author, is not
valid, without his Counter-assurance. But if he that so Covenanteth, knew before
hand he was to expect no other assurance, than the Actors word; then is the
Covenant valid; because the Actor in this case maketh himselfe the Author. And
therefore, as when the Authority is evident, the Covenant obligeth the Author,
not the Actor; so when the Authority is feigned, it obligeth the Actor onely;
there being no Author but himselfe.

{#9} There are few things, that are uncapable of being##_Things personated,
Inanimate._## represented by Fiction. Inanimate things, as a Church, an
Hospital, a Bridge, may be personated by a Rector, Master, or Overseer. But
things Inanimate, cannot be Authors, nor therefore give Authority to their
Actors: Yet the Actors may have Authority to procure their maintenance, given
them by those that are Owners, or Governours of those things. And therefore,
such things cannot be Personated, before there be some state of Civill
Government.

{#10} Likewise Children, Fooles, and Mad-men that have no#_Irrational;_# use
of Reason, may be Personated by Guardians, or Curators; but can be no Authors
(during that time) of any action done by them, longer then (when they shall
recover the use of Reason) they shall judge the same reasonable. Yet during the
Folly, he that hath right of governing them, may give Authority to the Guardian.
But this again has no place but in a State Civill, because before such estate,
there is no Dominion of Persons.

{#11} An Idol, or meer Figment of the brain, may be Personated;#_False Gods;_#
as were the Gods of the Heathen; which by such Officers as the State appointed,
were Personated, and held Possessions, and other Goods, and Rights, which men
from time to time dedicated, and consecrated unto them. But Idols cannot be
Authors: for an Idol is nothing. The Authority proceeded from the State: and
therefore before introduction of Civill Government, the Gods of the Heathen
could not be Personated.

{#12} The true God may be Personated. As he was; first,#_The true God._# by
_Moses_; who governed the Israelites, (that were not his, but Gods people,) not
in his own name, with _Hoc dicit Moses_; but in Gods Name, with _Hoc dicit
Dominus_. Secondly, by the Son of man, his own Son, our Blessed Saviour _Jesus
Christ_, that came to reduce the Jewes, and induce all Nations into the Kingdome
of his Father; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his Father. And thirdly, by
the Holy Ghost, or Comforter, speaking, and working in the Apostles: which Holy
Ghost, was a Comforter that came not of himselfe; but was sent, and proceeded
from them both.

{#13} #_A Multitude of men, how one Person._# A Multitude of men, are made
_One_ Person, when they are by one man, or one Person, Represented; so that it
be done with the consent of every one of that Multitude in particular. For it is
the _Unity_ of the Representer, not the _Unity_ of the Represented, that maketh
the Person _One_. And it is the Representer that beareth the Person, and but one
Person: And _Unity_, cannot otherwise be understood in Multitude.

{#14} #_Every one is Author._# And because the Multitude naturally is not
_One_, but _Many_; they cannot be understood for one; but many Authors, of every
thing their Representative saith, or doth in their name; Every man giving their
common Representer, Authority from himselfe in particular; and owning all the
actions the Representer doth, in case they give him Authority without stint:
Otherwise, when they limit him in what, and how farre he shall represent them,
none of them owneth more, than they gave him commission to Act.

{#15} #_An Actor may be Many men made One by Plurality of Voyces._# And if the
Representative consist of many men, the voyce of the greater number, must be
considered as the voyce of them all. For if the lesser number pronounce (for
example) in the Affirmative, and the greater in the Negative, there will be
Negatives more than enough to destroy the Affirmatives; and thereby the excesse
of Negatives, standing uncontradicted, are the onely voyce the Representative
hath.

{#16} #_Representatives, when the number is even, unprofitable._# And a
Representative of even number, especially when the number is not great, whereby
the contradictory voyces are oftentimes equall, is therefore oftentimes mute,
and uncapable of Action. Yet in some cases contradictory voyces equall in
number, may determine a question; as in condemning, or absolving, equality of
votes, even in that they condemne not, do absolve; but not on the contrary
condemne, in that they absolve not. For when a Cause is heard; not to condemne,
is to absolve: but on the contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is
not true. The like it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring
till another time: For when the voyces are equall, the not decreeing Execution,
is a decree of Dilation.

{#17} Or if the number be odde, as three, or more, (men,#_Negative voyce._# or
assemblies;) whereof every one has by a Negative Voice, authority to take away
the effect of all the Affirmative Voices of the rest, This number is no
Representative; because by the diversity of Opinions, and Interests of men, it
becomes oftentimes, and in cases of the greatest consequence, a mute Person, and
unapt, as for many things else, so for the government of a Multitude, especially
in time of Warre.

{#18} Of Authors there be two sorts. The first simply so called; which I have
before defined to be him, that owneth the Action of another simply. The second
is he, that owneth an Action, or Covenant of another conditionally; that is to
say, he undertaketh to do it, if the other doth it not, at, or before a certain
time. And these Authors conditionall, are generally called ^Suretyes^, in Latine
_Fidejussores_, and _Sponsores_; and particularly for Debt, _Pr{ae}des_; and for
Appearance before a Judge, or Magistrate, _Vades_.
