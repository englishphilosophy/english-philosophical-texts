£1 _Of the ^Naturall Condition^ of Mankind, as concerning their Felicity, and
Misery._ £1

{#1} #_Men by nature Equall._# ^Nature^ hath made men so equall, in the
faculties of body, and mind; as that though there bee found one man sometimes
manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind then another; yet when all is
reckoned together, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable,
as that one man can thereupon claim to himselfe any benefit, to which another
may not pretend, as well as he. For as to the strength of body, the weakest has
strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination, or by
confederacy with others, that are in the same danger with himselfe.

{#2} And as to the faculties of the mind, (setting aside the arts grounded upon
words, and especially that skill of proceeding upon generall, and infallible
rules, called Science; which very few have, and but in few things; as being not
a native faculty, born with us; nor attained, (as Prudence,) while we look after
somewhat els,) I find yet a greater equality amongst men, than that of strength.
For Prudence, is but Experience; which equall time, equally bestowes on all men,
in those things they equally apply themselves unto. That which may perhaps make
such equality incredible, is but a vain conceipt of ones owne wisdome, which
almost all men think they have in a greater degree, than the Vulgar; that is,
than all men but themselves, and a few others, whom by Fame, or for concurring
with themselves, they approve. For such is the nature of men, that howsoever
they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more
learned; Yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves: For
they see their own wit at hand, and other mens at a distance. But this proveth
rather that men are in that point equall, than unequall. For there is not
ordinarily a greater signe of the equall distribution of any thing, than that
every man is contented with his share.

{#3} From this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope#_From Equality
proceeds Diffidence._# in the attaining of our Ends. And therefore if any two
men desire the same thing, which neverthelesse they cannot both enjoy, they
become enemies; and in the way to their End, (which is principally their owne
conservation, and sometimes their delectation only,) endeavour to destroy, or
subdue one an other. And from hence it comes to passe, that where an Invader
hath no more to feare, than an other mans single power; if one plant, sow,
build, or possesse a convenient Seat, others may probably be expected to come
prepared with forces united, to dispossesse, and deprive him, not only of the
fruit of his labour, but also of his life, or liberty. And the Invader again is
in the like danger of another.

{#4} And from this diffidence of one another, there is no#_From Diffidence
Warre._# way for any man to secure himselfe, so reasonable, as Anticipation;
that is, by force, or wiles, to master the persons of all men he can, so long,
till he see no other power great enough to endanger him: And this is no more
than his own conservation requireth, and is generally allowed. Also because
there be some, that taking pleasure in contemplating their own power in the acts
of conquest, which they pursue farther than their security requires; if others,
that otherwise would be glad to be at ease within modest bounds, should not by
invasion increase their power, they would not be able, long time, by standing
only on their defence, to subsist. And by consequence, such augmentation of
dominion over men, being necessary to a mans conservation, it ought to be
allowed him.

{#5} Againe, men have no pleasure, (but on the contrary a great deale of griefe)
in keeping company, where there is no power able to over-awe them all. For every
man looketh that his companion should value him, at the same rate he sets upon
himselfe: And upon all signes of contempt, or undervaluing, naturally
endeavours, as far as he dares (which amongst them that have no common power to
keep them in quiet, is far enough to make them destroy each other,) to extort a
greater value from his contemners, by dommage; and from others, by the example.

{#6} So that in the nature of man, we find three principall causes of quarrell.
First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory.

{#7} The first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the
third, for Reputation. The first use Violence, to make themselves Masters of
other mens persons, wives, children, and cattell; the second, to defend them;
the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other
signe of undervalue, either direct in their Persons, or by reflexion in their
Kindred, their Friends, their Nation, their Profession, or their Name.

{#8} #_Out of Civil States, there is alwayes Warre of every one against every
one._# Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common
Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre;
and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. For ^Warre^, consisteth
not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in a tract of time, wherein
the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known: and therefore the notion
of _Time_, is to be considered in the nature of Warre; as it is in the nature of
Weather. For as the nature of Foule weather, lyeth not in a showre or two of
rain; but in an inclination thereto of many dayes together; So the nature of
War, consisteth not in actuall fighting; but in the known disposition thereto,
during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is
^Peace^.

{#9} #_The Incommodities of such a War._# Whatsoever therefore is consequent to
a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent
to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own
strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition,
there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and
consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities
that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving,
and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the
Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst
of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man,
solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.

{#10} It may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things;
that Nature should thus dissociate, and render men apt to invade, and destroy
one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to this Inference, made from the
Passions, desire perhaps to have the same confirmed by Experience. Let him
therefore consider with himselfe, when taking a journey, he armes himselfe, and
seeks to go well accompanied; when going to sleep, he locks his dores; when even
in his house he locks his chests; and this when he knowes there bee Lawes, and
publike Officers, armed, to revenge all injuries shall bee done him; what
opinion he has of his fellow subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow
Citizens, when he locks his dores; and of his children, and servants, when he
locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I
do by my words? But neither of us accuse mans nature in it. The Desires, and
other Passions of man, are in themselves no Sin. No more are the Actions, that
proceed from those Passions, till they know a Law that forbids them: which till
Lawes be made they cannot know: nor can any Law be made, till they have agreed
upon the Person that shall make it.

{#11} It may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time, nor condition
of warre as this; and I believe it was never generally so, over all the world:
but there are many places, where they live so now. For the savage people in many
places of _America_, except the government of small Families, the concord
whereof dependeth on naturall lust, have no government at all; and live at this
day in that brutish manner, as I said before. Howsoever, it may be perceived
what manner of life there would be, where there were no common Power to feare;
by the manner of life, which men that have formerly lived under a peacefull
government, use to degenerate into, in a civill Warre.

{#12} But though there had never been any time, wherein particular men were in a
condition of warre one against another; yet in all times, Kings, and Persons of
Soveraigne authority, because of their Independency, are in continuall
jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators; having their weapons
pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another; that is, their Forts, Garrisons,
and Guns upon the Frontiers of their Kingdomes; and continuall Spyes upon their
neighbours; which is a posture of War. But because they uphold thereby, the
Industry of their Subjects; there does not follow from it, that misery, which
accompanies the Liberty of particular men.

{#13} #_In such a Warre, nothing is Unjust._# To this warre of every man against
every man, this also is consequent; that nothing can be Unjust. The notions of
Right and Wrong, Justice and Injustice have there no place. Where there is no
common Power, there is no Law: where no Law, no Injustice. Force, and Fraud, are
in warre the two Cardinall vertues. Justice, and Injustice are none of the
Faculties neither of the Body, nor Mind. If they were, they might be in a man
that were alone in the world, as well as his Senses, and Passions. They are
Qualities, that relate to men in Society, not in Solitude. It is consequent also
to the same condition, that there be no Propriety, no Dominion, no _Mine_ and
_Thine_ distinct; but onely that to be every mans, that he can get; and for so
long, as he can keep it. And thus much for the ill condition, which man by meer
Nature is actually placed in; though with a possibility to come out of it,
consisting partly in the Passions, partly in his Reason.

{#14} #_The Passions that incline men to Peace._# The Passions that encline men
to Peace, are Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to
commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them. And Reason
suggesteth convenient Articles of Peace, upon which men may be drawn to
agreement. These Articles, are they, which otherwise are called the Lawes of
Nature: whereof I shall speak more particularly, in the two following Chapters.
