£1 _Of the first and second ^Naturall Lawes^, and of ^Contracts^._ £1

{#1} #_Right of Nature what._# ^The Right Of Nature^, which Writers commonly
call _Jus Naturale_, is the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power, as he
will himselfe, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his
own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own Judgement, and
Reason, hee shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.

{#2} By ^Liberty^, is understood, according to the proper#_Liberty what._#
signification of the word, the absence of externall Impediments: which
Impediments, may oft take away part of a mans power to do what hee would; but
cannot hinder him from using the power left him, according as his judgement, and
reason shall dictate to him.

{#3} #_A Law of
Nature. what._# ^A Law Of Nature^, (_Lex Naturalis_,) is a Precept, orgenerall
Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is
destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same; and to
omit, that, by which he thinketh it may be best preserved. For though they that
speak of this subject, use to confound _Jus_, and _Lex, Right_ and _Law_; yet
they ought to be distinguished; because ^Right^, consisteth #_Difference of Right
and Law._# in liberty to do, or to forbeare; Whereas ^Law^, determineth, and
bindeth to one of them: so that Law, and Right, differ as much, as Obligation,
and Liberty; which in one and the same matter are inconsistent.

{#4} And because the condition of Man, (as hath been #_Naturally every man has
Right to everything._# declared in the precedent Chapter) is a condition of
Warre of every one against every one; in which case every one is governed by his
own Reason; and there is nothing he can make use of, that may not be a help unto
him, in preserving his life against his enemyes; It followeth, that in such a
condition, every man has a Right to every thing; even to one anothers body. And
therefore, as long as this naturall Right of every man to every thing endureth,
there can be no security to any man, (how strong or wise soever he be,) of
living out the time, which Nature ordinarily alloweth men to live. And
consequently it is a precept, or generall rule of Reason,#_The Fundamentall Law
of Nature._# _That every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has hope
of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all
helps, and advantages of Warre_. The first branch of which Rule, containeth the
first, and Fundamentall Law of Nature; which is, _to seek Peace, and follow it_.
The Second, the summe of the Right of Nature; which is, _By all means we can, to
defend our selves_.

{#5} #_The second Law of Nature._# From this Fundamentall Law of Nature, by
which men are commanded to endeavour Peace, is derived this second Law; _That a
man be willing, when others are so_ _too, as farre-forth, as for Peace, and
defence of himselfe he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all
things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would
allow other men against himselfe_. For as long as every man holdeth this Right,
of doing any thing he liketh; so long are all men in the condition of Warre. But
if other men will not lay down their Right, as well as he; then there is no
Reason for any one, to devest himselfe of his: For that were to expose himselfe
to Prey, (which no man is bound to) rather than to dispose himselfe to Peace.
This is that Law of the Gospell; _Whatsoever you require that others should do
to you, that do ye to them_. And that Law of all men, _Quod tibi fieri non vis,
alteri ne feceris_.

{#6} #_What it is to lay down a Right._# To _lay downe_ a mans _Right_ to any
thing, is to _devest_ himselfe of the _Liberty_, of hindring another of the
benefit of his own Right to the same. For he that renounceth, or passeth away
his Right, giveth not to any other man a Right which he had not before; because
there is nothing to which every man had not Right by Nature: but onely standeth
out of his way, that he may enjoy his own originall Right, without hindrance
from him; not without hindrance from another. So that the effect which
redoundeth to one man, by another mans defect of Right, is but so much
diminution of impediments to the use of his own Right originall.

{#7} #_Renouncing a Right what it is._# Right is layd aside, either by simply
Renouncing it; or by Transferring it to another. By _Simply_ ^Renouncing^; when
he cares not to whom the benefit thereof redoundeth. By ^Transferring^; when he
intendeth the benefit thereof to some certain person, or persons. And when a man
hath in either#_Transferring Right what._# manner abandoned, or granted away his
Right; then is he said to be ^Obliged^, or ^Bound^, not to hinder those, to whom
such Right is granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that he
_ought_, and it is his ^Duty^, not to make voyd that voluntary act of his own:
and that such hindrance is ^Injustice^, and ^Injury^, as being#_Obligation._#
_Sine Jure_; the Right being before renounced, or transferred. So that _Injury_,
or _Injustice_, in the controversies of the world, is somewhat like to that,
which in the disputations of Scholers is called _Absurdity_. For#_Duty._# as it
is there called an Absurdity, to contradict what one maintained in the
Beginning: so in the world, it is called Injustice, and injury,#_Injustice._#
voluntarily to undo that, which from the beginning he had voluntarily done. The
way by which a man either simply Renounceth, or Transferreth his Right, is a
Declaration, or Signification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or
signes, that he doth so Renounced, or Transferre; or hath so Renounced, or
Transferred the same, to him that accepteth it. And these Signes are either
Words onely, or Actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often) both Words, and
Actions. And the same are the ^Bonds^, by which men are bound, and obliged:
Bonds, that have their strength, not from their own Nature, (for nothing is more
easily broken then a mans word,) but from Feare of some evill consequence upon
the rupture.

{#8} Whensoever a man Transferreth his Right, or Renounceth#_Not all Rights are
alienable._# it; it is either in consideration of some Right reciprocally
transferred to himselfe; or for some other good he hopeth for thereby. For it is
a voluntary act: and of the voluntary acts of every man, the object is some
_Good to himselfe_. And therefore there be some Rights, which no man can be
understood by any words, or other signes, to have abandoned, or transferred. As
first a man cannot lay down the right of resisting them, that assault him by
force, to take away his life; because he cannot be understood to ayme thereby,
at any Good to himselfe. The same may be sayd of Wounds, and Chayns, and
Imprisonment; both because there is no benefit consequent to such patience; as
there is to the patience of suffering another to be wounded, or imprisoned: as
also because a man cannot tell, when he seeth men proceed against him by
violence, whether they intend his death or not. And lastly the motive, and end
for which this renouncing, and transferring of Right is introduced, is nothing
else but the security of a mans person, in his life, and in the means of so
preserving life, as not to be weary of it. And therefore if a man by words, or
other signes, seem to despoyle himselfe of the End, for which those signes were
intended; he is not to be understood as if he meant it, or that it was his will;
but that he was ignorant of how such words and actions were to be interpreted.

{#9} #_Contract what._# The mutuall transferring of Right, is that which men
call ^Contract^.

{#10} There is difference, between transferring of Right to the Thing; and
transferring, or tradition, that is, delivery of the Thing it selfe. For the
Thing may be delivered together with the Translation of the Right; as in buying
and selling with ready mony; or exchange of goods, or lands: and it may be
delivered some time after.

{#11} Again, one of the Contractors, may deliver the Thing contracted for on his
part, and leave the other to perform his part at some determinate time after,
and in the mean time be trusted; and then the Contract on his part, is#_Covenant
what._# called ^Pact^, or ^Covenant^: Or both parts may contract now, to
performe hereafter: in which cases, he that is to performe in time to come,
being trusted, his performance is called _Keeping of Promise_, or Faith; and the
fayling of performance (if it be voluntary) _Violation of Faith_.

{#12} When the transferring of Right, is not mutuall; but one of the parties
transferreth, in hope to gain thereby friendship, or service from another, or
from his friends; or in hope to gain the reputation of Charity, or Magnanimity;
or to deliver his mind from the pain of compassion; or in hope of reward in
heaven; This is not Contract, but ^Gift^, ^Free-gift^, ^Grace^: which
words#_Free-gift._# signifie one and the same thing.

{#13} Signes of Contract, are either _Expresse_, or by _Inference_.#_Signes of
Contract Expresse._# Expresse, are words spoken with understanding of what they
signifie: And such words are either of the time _Present_, or _Past_; as, _I
Give, I Grant, I have Given, I have Granted, I will that this be yours:_ Or of
the future; as, _I will Give, I will Grant:_ which words of the future, are
called ^Promise^.

{#14} Signes by Inference, are sometimes the consequence of Words; sometimes the
consequence of Silence; sometimes the consequence of Actions; somtimes the
consequence#_Signes of Contract by Inference._# of Forbearing an Action: and
generally a signe by Inference, of any Contract, is whatsoever sufficiently
argues the will of the Contractor.

{#15} Words alone, if they be of the time to come, and#_Free gift passeth by
words of the Present or Past._# contain a bare promise, are an insufficient
signe of a Free-gift and therefore not obligatory. For if they be of the time to
Come, as, _To morrow I will Give_, they are a signe I have not given yet, and
consequently that my right is not transferred, but remaineth till I transferre
it by some other Act. But if the words be of the time Present, or Past, as, _I
have given, or do give to be delivered to morrow_, then is my to morrows Right
given away to day; and that by the vertue of the words, though there were no
other argument of my will. And there is a great difference in the signification
of these words, _Volo hoc tuum esse cras_, and _Cras dabo_; that is, between _I
will that this be thine to morrow_, and, _I will give it thee to morrow_: For
the word _I will_, in the former manner of speech, signifies an act of the will
Present; but in the later, it signifies a promise of an act of the will to Come:
and therefore the former words, being of the Present, transferre a future right;
the later, that be of the Future, transferre nothing. But if there be other
signes of the Will to transferre a Right, besides Words; then, though the gift
be Free, yet may the Right be understood to passe by words of the future: as if
a man propound a Prize to him that comes first to the end of a race, The gift is
Free; and though the words be of the Future, yet the Right passeth: for if he
would not have his words so be understood, he should not have let them runne.

{#16} #_Signes of Contract are words both of the Past, Present, and Future._# In
Contracts, the right passeth, not onely where the words are of the time Present,
or Past; but also where they are of the Future: because all Contract is mutuall
translation, or change of Right; and therefore he that promiseth onely, because
he hath already received the benefit for which he promiseth, is to be understood
as if he intended the Right should passe: for unlesse he had been content to
have his words so understood, the other would not have performed his part first.
And for that cause, in buying, and selling, and other acts of Contract, a
Promise is equivalent to a Covenant; and therefore obligatory.

{#17} #_Merit what._# He that performeth first in the case of a Contract, is
said to ^Merit^ that which he is to receive by the performance of the other; and
he hath it as _Due_. Also when a Prize is propounded to many, which is to be
given to him onely that winneth; or mony is thrown amongst many, to be enjoyed
by them that catch it; though this be a Free gift; yet so to Win, or so to
Catch, is to _Merit_, and to have it as ^Due^. For the Right is transferred in
the Propounding of the Prize, and in throwing down the mony; though it be not
determined to whom, but by the Event of the contention. But there is between
these two sorts of Merit, this difference, that In Contract, I Merit by vertue
of my own power, and the Contractors need; but in this case of Free gift, I am
enabled to Merit onely by the benignity of the Giver: In Contract, I merit at
the Contractors hand that hee should depart with his right; In this case of
Gift, I Merit not that the giver should part with his right; but that when he
has parted with it, it should be mine, rather than anothers. And this I think to
be the meaning of that distinction of the Schooles, between _Meritum congrui_,
and _Meritum condigni_. For God Almighty, having promised Paradise to those men
(hoodwinkt with carnall desires,) that can walk through this world according to
the Precepts, and Limits prescribed by him; they say, he that shall so walk,
shall Merit Paradise _Ex congruo_. But because no man can demand a right to it,
by his own Righteousnesse, or any other power in himselfe, but by the Free Grace
of God onely; they say, no man can Merit Paradise _ex condigno_. This I say, I
think is the meaning of that distinction; but because Disputers do not agree
upon the signification of their own termes of Art, longer than it serves their
turn; I will not affirme any thing of their meaning: onely this I say; when a
gift is given indefinitely, as a prize to be contended for, he that winneth
Meriteth, and may claime the Prize as Due.

{#18} If a Covenant be made, wherein neither of the parties#_Covenants of
Mutuall trust, when Invalid._# performe presently, but trust one another; in the
condition of meer Nature, (which is a condition of Warre of every man against
every man,) upon any reasonable suspition, it is Voyd: But if there be a common
Power set over them both, with right and force sufficient to compell
performance; it is not Voyd. For he that performeth first, has no assurance the
other will performe after; because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle
mens ambition, avarice, anger, and other Passions, without the feare of some
coerceive Power; which in the condition of meer Nature, where all men are
equall, and judges of the justnesse of their own fears, cannot possibly be
supposed. And therfore he which performeth first, does but betray himselfe to
his enemy; contrary to the Right (he can never abandon) of defending his life,
and means of living.

{#19} But in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain those
that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more reasonable; and
for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform first, is obliged so to
do.

{#20} The cause of feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be alwayes
something arising after the Covenant made; as some new fact, or other signe of
the Will not to performe: else it cannot make the Covenant voyd. For that which
could not hinder a man from promising, ought not to be admitted as a hindrance
of performing.

{#21} #_Right to the End, Containeth Right to the Means._# He that transferreth
any Right, transferreth the Means of enjoying it, as farre as lyeth in his
power. As he that selleth Land, is understood to transferre the Herbage, and
whatsoever growes upon it; Nor can he that sells a Mill turn away the Stream
that drives it. And they that give to a man the Right of government in
Soveraignty, are understood to give him the right of levying mony to maintain
Souldiers; and of appointing Magistrates for the administration of Justice.

{#22} #_No Covenant with Beasts._# To make Covenants with bruit Beasts, is
impossible; because not understanding our speech, they understand not, nor
accept of any translation of Right; nor can translate any Right to another: and
without mutuall acceptation, there is no Covenant.

{#23} #_Nor with God without special Revelation._# To make Covenant with God, is
impossible, but by Mediation of such as God speaketh to, either by Revelation
supernaturall, or by his Lieutenants that govern under him, and in his Name: For
otherwise we know not whether our Covenants be accepted, or not. And therefore
they that Vow any thing contrary to any law of Nature, Vow in vain; as being a
thing unjust to pay such Vow. And if it be a thing commanded by the Law of
Nature, it is not the Vow, but the Law that binds them.

{#24} #_No Covenant, but of Possible and Future._# The matter, or subject of a
Covenant, is alwayes something that falleth under deliberation; (For to
Covenant, is an act of the Will; that is to say an act, and the last act, of
deliberation;) and is therefore alwayes understood to be something to come; and
which is judged Possible for him that Covenanteth, to performe.

{#25} And therefore, to promise that which is known to be Impossible, is no
Covenant. But if that prove impossible afterwards, which before was thought
possible, the Covenant is valid, and bindeth, (though not to the thing it
selfe,) yet to the value; or, if that also be impossible, to the unfeigned
endeavour of performing as much as is possible: for to more no man can be
obliged.

{#26} #_Covenants how made voyd._# Men are freed of their Covenants two wayes;
by Performing; or by being Forgiven. For Performance, is the naturall end of
obligation; and Forgivenesse, the restitution of liberty; as being a
re-transferring of that Right, in which the obligation consisted.

{#27} #_Covenants extorted by feare are valide._# Covenants entred into by fear,
in the condition of meer Nature, are obligatory. For example, if I Covenant to
pay a ransome, or service for my life, to an enemy; I am bound by it. For it is
a Contract, wherein one receiveth the benefit of life; the other is to receive
mony, or service for it; and consequently, where no other Law (as in the
condition, of meer Nature) forbiddeth the performance, the Covenant is valid.
Therefore Prisoners of warre, if trusted with the payment of their Ransome, are
obliged to pay it: And if a weaker Prince, make a disadvantageous peace with a
stronger, for feare; he is bound to keep it; unlesse (as hath been sayd before)
there ariseth some new, and just cause of feare, to renew the war. And even in
Common-wealths, if I be forced to redeem my selfe from a Theefe by promising him
mony, I am bound to pay it, till the Civill Law discharge me. For whatsoever I
may lawfully do without Obligation, the same I may lawfully Covenant to do
through feare: and what I lawfully Covenant, I cannot lawfully break.

{#28} A former Covenant, makes voyd a later. For a man#_The former Covenant to
one, makes voyd the later to another._# that hath passed away his Right to one
man to day, hath it not to passe to morrow to another: and therefore the later
promise passeth no Right, but is null.

{#29} #_A mans Covenant not to defend himselfe, is voyd._#A Covenant not to
defend my selfe from force, by force, is alwayes voyd. For (as I have shewed
before) no man can transferre, or lay down his Right to save himselfe from
Death, Wounds, and Imprisonment, (the avoyding whereof is the onely End of
laying down any Right, and therefore the promise of not resisting force, in no
Covenant transferreth any right; nor is obliging. For though a man may Covenant
thus, _Unlesse I do so, or so, kill me_; he cannot Covenant thus, _Unlesse I do
so, or so, I will not resist you, when you come to kill me_. For man by nature
chooseth the lesser evill, which is danger of death in resisting; rather than
the greater, which is certain and present death in not resisting. And this is
granted to be true by all men, in that they lead Criminals to Execution, and
Prison. with armed men, notwithstanding that such Criminals have consented to
the Law by which they are condemned.

{#30} #_No man obliged to accuse himself._# A Covenant to accuse ones selfe,
without assurance of pardon, is likewise invalide. For in the condition of
Nature, where every man is Judge, there is no place for Accusation: and in the
Civill State, the Accusation is followed with Punishment; which being Force, a
man is not obliged not to resist. The same is also true, of the Accusation of
those, by whose Condemnation a man falls into misery; as of a Father, Wife, or
Benefactor.

{#31} For the Testimony of such an Accuser, if it be not willingly given, is
pr{ae}sumed to be corrupted by Nature; and therefore not to be received: and
where a mans Testimony is not to be credited, he is not bound to give it. Also
Accusations upon Torture, are not to be reputed as Testimonies. For Torture is
to be used but as means of conjecture, and light, in the further examination,
and search of truth: and what is in that case confessed, tendeth to the ease of
him that is Tortured; not to the informing of the Torturers: and therefore ought
not to have the credit of a sufficient Testimony: for whether he deliver
himselfe by true, or false Accusation, he does it by the Right of preserving his
own life.

{#32} #_The End of an Oath._# The force of Words, being (as I have formerly
noted) too weak to hold men to the performance of their Covenants; there are in
mans nature, but two imaginable helps to strengthen it. And those are either a
Feare of the consequence of breaking their word; or a Glory, or Pride in
appearing not to need to breake it. This later is a Generosity too rarely found
to be presumed on, especially in the pursuers of Wealth, Command, or sensuall
Pleasure; which are the greatest part of Mankind. The Passion to be reckoned
upon, is Fear; whereof there be two very generall Objects: one, The Power of
Spirits Invisible; the other, The Power of those men they shall therein Offend.
Of these two, though the former be the greater Power, yet the feare of the later
is commonly the greater Feare. The Feare of the former is in every man, his own
Religion: which hath place in the nature of man before Civill Society. The later
hath not so; at least not place enough, to keep men to their promises; because
in the condition of ineer Nature, the inequality of Power is not discerned, but
by the event of Battell. So that before the time of Civill Society, or in the
interruption thereof by Warre, there is nothing can strengthen a Covenant of
Peace agreed on, against the temptations of Avarice, Ambition, Lust, or other
strong desire, but the feare of that Invisible Power, which they every one
Worship as God; and Feare as a Revenger of their perfidy. All therefore that can
be done between two men not subject to Civill Power, is to put one another to
swear by the God he feareth: Which _Swearing_, or#_The forme of an Oath._#
^Oath^, is a _Forme of Speech, added to a Promise; by which he that promiseth,
signifieth, that unlesse he performe, he renounceth the mercy of his God, or
calleth to him for vengeance on himselfe_. Such was the Heathen Forme, _Let_
Jupiter _kill me else, as I kill this Beast_. So is our Forme, _I shall do thus,
and thus, so help me God_. And this, with the Rites and Ceremonies, which every
one useth in his own Religion, that the feare of breaking faith might be the
greater.

{#33} By this it appears, that an Oath taken according to#_No Oath, but by
God._# any other Forme, or Rite, then his, that sweareth, is in vain; and no
Oath: And that there is no Swearing by any thing which the Swearer thinks not
God. For though men have sometimes used to swear by their Kings, for feare, or
flattery; yet they would have it thereby understood, they attributed to them
Divine honour. And that Swearing unnecessarily by God, is but prophaning of his
name: and Swearing by other things, as men do in common discourse, is not
Swearing, but an impious Custome, gotten by too much vehemence of talking.

{#34} It appears also, that the Oath addes nothing to the#_An Oath addes nothing
to the Obligation._# Obligation. For a Covenant, if lawfull, binds in the sight
of God, without the Oath, as much as with it: if unlawfull, bindeth not at all;
though it be confirmed with an Oath.
