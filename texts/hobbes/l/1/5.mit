£1 _Of ^Reason^, and ^Science^._ £1

{#1} #_Reason what it is._# WHen a man _Reasoneth_, hee does nothing else but
conceive a summe totall, from _Addition_ of parcels; or conceive a Remainder,
from _Substraction_ of one summe from another: which (if it be done by Words,)
is conceiving of the consequence of the names of all the parts, to the name of
the whole; or from the names of the whole and one part, to the name of the other
part. And though in some things, (as in numbers,) besides _Adding_ and
_Substracting_, men name other operations, as _Multiplying_ and _Dividing_; yet
they are the same; for Multiplication, is but Adding together of things equall;
and Division, but Substracting of one thing, as often as we can. These
operations are not incident to Numbers onely, but to all manner of things that
can be added together, and taken one out of another. For as Arithmeticians teach
to adde and substract in _numbers_; so the Geometricians teach the same in
_lines, figures_ (solid and superficiall,) _angles, proportions, times_, degrees
of _swiftnesse, force, power_, and the like; The Logicians teach the same in
_Consequences of words_; adding together _two Names_, to make an _Affirmation_;
and _two Affirmations_, to make a _Syllogisme_; and _many Syllogismes_ to make a
_Demonstration_; and from the _summe_, or _Conclusion_ of a _Syllogisme_, they
substract one _Proposition_, to finde the other. Writers of Politiques, adde
together _Pactions_, to find mens _duties_; and Lawyers, _Lawes_, and _facts_,
to find what is _right_ and _wrong_ in the actions of private men. In summe, in
what matter soever there is place for _addition_ and _substraction_, there also
is place for _Reason_; and where these have no place, there _Reason_ has nothing
at all to do.

{#2} Out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,#_Resaon
defined._#) what that is, which is meant by this word _Reason_, when wee reckon
it amongst the Faculties of the mind. For ^Reason^, in this sense, is nothing
but _Reckoning_ (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the Consequences of
generall names agreed upon, for the _marking_ and _signifying_ of our thoughts;
I say _marking_ them, when we reckon by our selves; and _signifying_, when we
demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other men.

{#3} And as in Arithmetique, unpractised men must, and#_Right reason where_#
Professors themselves may often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other
subject of Reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men, may
deceive themselves, and inferre false Conclusions; Not but that Reason it selfe
is alwayes Right Reason, as well as Arithmetique is a certain and infallible
Art: But no one mans Reason, nor the Reason of any one number of men, makes the
certaintie; no more than an account is therefore well cast up, because a great
many men have unanimously approved it. And therefore, as when there is a
controversy in an account, the parties must by their own accord, set up for
right Reason, the Reason of some Arbitrator, or Judge, to whose sentence they
will both stand, or their controversie must either come to blowes, or be
undecided, for want of a right Reason constituted by Nature; so is it also in
all debates of what kind soever: And when men that think themselves wiser than
all others, clamor and demand right Reason for judge; yet seek no more, but that
things should be determined, by no other mens reason but their own, it is as
intolerable in the society of men, as it is in play after trump is turned, to
use for trump on every occasion, that suite whereof they have most in their
hand. For they do nothing els, that will have every of their passions, as it
comes to bear sway in them, to be taken for right Reason, and that in their own
controversies: bewraying their want of right Reason, by the claym they lay to
it.

{#4} #_The use of Reason._# The Use and End of Reason, is not the finding of the
summe, and truth of one, or a few consequences, remote from the first
definitions, and settled significations of names; but to begin at these; and
proceed from one consequence to another. For there can be no certainty of the
last Conclusion, without a certainty of all those Affirmations and Negations, on
which it was grounded, and inferred. As when a master of a family, in taking an
account, casteth up the summs of all the bills of expence, into one sum; and not
regarding how each bill is summed up, by those that give them in account; nor
what it is he payes for; he advantages himself no more, than if he allowed the
account in grosse, trusting to every of the accountants skill and honesty: so
also in Reasoning of all other things, he that takes up conclusions on the trust
of Authors, and doth not fetch them from the first Items in every Reckoning,
(which are the significations of names settled by definitions), loses his
labour; and does not know any thing; but onely beleeveth.

{#5} #_Of Error and Absurdity._# When a man reckons without the use of words,
which may be done in particular things, (as when upon the sight of any one
thing, wee conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow
upon it;) if that which he thought likely to follow, followes not; or that which
he thought likely to have preceded it, hath not preceded it, this is called
^Error^; to which even the most prudent men are subject. But when we Reason in
Words of generall signification, and fall upon a generall inference which is
false; though it be commonly called _Error_, it is indeed an ^Absurdity^, or
senslesse Speech. For Error is but a deception, in presuming that somewhat is
past, or to come; of which, though it were not past, or not to come; yet there
was no impossibility discoverable. But when we make a generall assertion,
unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is unconceivable. And words
whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call _Absurd,
Insignificant_, and _Non-sense_. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a
_round Quadrangle_; or _accidents of Bread in Cheese_; or _Immateriall
Substances_; or of _A free Subject_; _A free-Will_; or any _Free_, but free from
being hindred by opposition, I should not say he were in an Errour; but that his
words were without meaning; that is to say, Absurd.

{#6} I have said before, (in the second chapter,) that a Man did excell all
other Animals in this faculty, that when he conceived any thing whatsoever, he
was apt to enquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it.
And now I adde this other degree of the same excellence, that he can by words
reduce the consequences he findes to generall Rules, called _Theoremes_, or
_Aphorismes_; that is, he can Reason, or reckon, not onely in number; but in all
other things, whereof one may be added unto, or substracted from another.

{#7} But this priviledge, is allayed by another; and that is, by the priviledge
of Absurdity; to which no living creature is subject, but man onely. And of men,
those are of all most subject to it, that professe Philosophy. For it is most
true that _Cicero_ sayth of them somewhere; that there can be nothing so absurd,
but may be found in the books of Philosophers. And the reason is manifest. For
there is not one of them that begins his ratiocination from the Definitions, or
Explications of the names they are to use; which is a method that hath been used
onely in Geometry; whose Conclusions have thereby been made indisputable.

{#8} The first cause of Absurd conclusions I ascribe to the#_Causes of
absurditie I._# want of Method; in that they begin not their Ratiocination from
Definitions; that is, from settled significations of their words: as if they
could cast account, without knowing the value of the numerall words, _one, two_,
and _three_.

{#9} And whereas all bodies enter into account upon divers considerations,
(which I have mentioned in the precedent chapter;) these considerations being
diversly named, divers absurdities proceed from the confusion, and unfit
connexion of their names into assertions. And therefore

{#10} The second cause of Absurd assertions, I ascribe to the giving of names of
_bodies_, to _accidents_; or of _accidents_, to _bodies_; As they do, that say,
_Faith is infused_, or _inspired_; when nothing can be _powred_, or _breathed_
into any thing, but body; and that, _extension_ is _body_; that _phantasmes_ are
_spirits_, &c.

{#11} #_3._# The third I ascribe to the giving of the names of the _accidents_
of _bodies without us_, to the _accidents_ of our _own bodies_; as they do that
say, the _colour is in the body_; _the sound is in the ayre_, &c.

{#12} #_4._# The fourth, to the giving of the names of _bodies_, to _names_, or
_speeches_; as they do that say, that _there be things universall_; that _a
living creature is Genus_, or _a generall thing_, &c.

{#13} #_5._# The fifth, to the giving of the names of _accidents_, to _names_
and _speeches_; as they do that say, _the nature of a thing is its definition_;
_a mans command is his will_; and the like.

{#14} #_6._# The sixth, to the use of Metaphors, Tropes, and other Rhetoricall
figures, in stead of words proper. For though it be lawfull to say, (for
example) in common speech, _the way goeth, or leadeth hither, or thither, The
Proverb sayes this or that_ (whereas wayes cannot go, nor Proverbs speak;) yet
in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to be admitted.

{#15} #_7._# The seventh, to names that signifie nothing; but are taken up, and
learned by rote from the Schooles, as _hypostatical, transubstantiate,
consubstantiate, eternal-Now_, and the like canting of Schoolemen.

{#16} To him that can avoyd these things, it is not easie to fall into any
absurdity, unlesse it be by the length of an account; wherein he may perhaps
forget what went before. For all men by nature reason alike, and well, when they
have good principles. For who is so stupid, as both to mistake in Geometry, and
also to persist in it, when another detects his error to him?

{#17} #_Science._# By this it appears that Reason is not as Sense, and Memory,
borne with us; nor gotten by Experience onely, as Prudence is; but attayned by
Industry; first in apt imposing of Names; and secondly by getting a good and
orderly Method in proceeding from the Elements, which are Names, to Assertions
made by Connexion of one of them to another; and so to Syllogismes, which are
the Connexions of one Assertion to another, till we come to a knowledge of all
the Consequences of names appertaining to the subject in hand; and that is it,
men call ^Science^. And whereas Sense and Memory are but knowledge of Fact,
which is a thing past, and irrevocable; _Science_ is the knowledge of
Consequences, and dependance of one fact upon another: by which, out of that we
can presently do, we know how to do something else when we will, or the like,
another time: Because when we see how any thing comes about, upon what causes,
and by what manner; when the like causes come into our power, wee see how to
make it produce the like effects.

{#18} Children therefore are not endued with Reason at all, till they have
attained the use of Speech: but are called Reasonable Creatures, for the
possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. And the most
part of men, though they have the use of Reasoning a little way, as in numbring
to some degree; yet it serves them to little use in common life; in which they
govern themselves, some better, some worse, according to their differences of
experience, quicknesse of memory, and inclinations to severall ends; but
specially according to good or evill fortune, and the errors of one another. For
as for _Science_, or certain rules of their actions, they are so farre from it,
that they know not what it is. Geometry they have thought Conjuring: But for
other Sciences, they who have not been taught the beginnings, and some progresse
in them, that they may see how they be acquired and generated, are in this point
like children, that having no thought of generation, are made believe by the
women, that their brothers and sisters are not born, but found in the garden.

{#19} But yet they that have no _Science_, are in better, and nobler condition
with their naturall Prudence; than men, that by mis-reasoning, or by trusting
them that reason wrong, fall upon false and absurd generall rules. For ignorance
of causes, and of rules, does not set men so farre out of their way, as relying
on false rules, and taking for causes of what they aspire to, those that are not
so, but rather causes of the contrary.

{#20} To conclude, The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words, but by exact
definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; _Reason_ is the _pace_;
Encrease of _Science_, the _way_; and the Benefit of man-kind, the _end_. And on
the contrary, Metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words, are like _ignes
fatui_; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst innumerable absurdities;
and their end, contention, and sedition, or contempt.

{#21} #_Prudence & Sapience, with their difference._# As, much Experience, is
_Prudence_; so, is much Science, _Sapience_. For though wee usually have one
name of Wisedome for them both; yet the Latines did alwayes distinguish between
_Prudentia_ and _Sapientia_; ascribing the former to Experience, the later to
Science. But to make their difference appeare more cleerly, let us suppose one
man endued with an excellent naturall use, and dexterity in handling his armes;
and another to have added to that dexterity, an acquired Science, of where he
can offend, or be offended by his adversarie, in every possible posture, or
guard: The ability of the former, would be to the ability of the later, as
Prudence to Sapience; both usefull; but the later infallible. But they that
trusting onely to the authority of books, follow the blind blindly, are like him
that trusting to the false rules of a master of Fence, ventures
pr{ae}sumptuously upon an adversary, that either kills, or disgraces him.

{#22} #_Signes of Science._# The signes of Science, are some, certain and
infallible; some, uncertain. Certain, when he that pretendeth the Science of any
thing, can teach the same; that is to say, demonstrate the truth thereof
perspicuously to another: Uncertain, when onely some particular events answer to
his pretence, and upon many occasions prove so as he sayes they must. Signes of
prudence are all uncertain; because to observe by experience, and remember all
circumstances that may alter the successe, is impossible. But in any businesse,
whereof a man has not infallible Science to proceed by; to forsake his own
naturall judgement, and be guided by generall sentences read in Authors, and
subject to many exceptions, is a signe of folly, and generally scorned by the
name of Pedantry. And even of those men themselves, that in Councells of the
Common-wealth, love to shew their reading of Politiques and History, very few do
it in their domestique affaires, where their particular interest is concerned;
having Prudence enough for their private affaires: but in publique they study
more the reputation of their owne wit, than the successe of anothers businesse.
