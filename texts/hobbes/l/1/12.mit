£1 _Of ^Religion^._ £1

{#1} ^Seeing^ there are no signes, nor fruit of _Religion_, but#_Religion, in
Man onely._# in Man onely; there is no cause to doubt, but that the seed of
_Religion_, is also onely in Man; and consisteth in some peculiar quality, or at
least in some eminent degree therof, not to be found in other Living creatures.

{#2} #_First, from his desíre of knowing Causes._# And first, it is peculiar to
the nature of Man, to be inquisitive into the Causes of the Events they see,
some more, some lesse; but all men so much, as to be curious in the search of
the causes of their own good and evill fortune.

{#3} #_From the consideration of the Beginning of things._# Secondly, upon the
sight of any thing that hath a Beginning, to think also it had a cause, which
determined the same to begin, then when it did, rather than sooner or later.

{#4} #_From his observation of the Sequell of things._# Thirdly, whereas there
is no other Felicity of Beasts, but the enjoying of their quotidian Food, Ease,
and Lusts; as having little, or no foresight of the time to come, for want of
observation, and memory of the order, consequence, and dependance of the things
they see; Man observeth how one Event hath been produced by another; and
remembreth in them Antecedence and Consequence; And when he cannot assure
himselfe of the true causes of things, (for the causes of good and evill fortune
for the most part are invisible,) he supposes causes of them, either such as his
own fancy suggesteth; or trusteth to the Authority of other men, such as he
thinks to be his friends, and wiser than himselfe.

{#5} #_The naturall Cause of Religion, the Anxiety of the time to come._# The
two first, make Anxiety. For being assured that there be causes of all things
that have arrived hitherto, or shall arrive hereafter; it is impossible for a
man, who continually endeavoureth to secure himselfe against the evill he
feares, and procure the good he desireth, not to be in a perpetuall solicitude
of the time to come; So that every man, especially those that are over
provident, are in an estate like to that of _Prometheus_. For as _Prometheus_,
(which interpreted, is, _The prudent man_,) was bound to the hill _Caucasus_, a
place of large prospect, where, an Eagle feeding on his liver, devoured in the
day, as much as was repayred in the night: So that man, which looks too far
before him, in the care of future time, hath his heart all the day long, gnawed
on by feare of death, poverty, or other calamity; and has no repose, nor pause
of his anxiety, but in sleep.

{#6} #_Which makes them fear the Power of Invisible things._# This perpetuall
feare, alwayes accompanying mankind in the ignorance of causes, as it were in
the Dark, must needs have for object something. And therefore when there is
nothing to be seen, there is nothing to accuse, either of their good, or evill
fortune, but some _Power_, or Agent _Invisible_: In which sense perhaps it was,
that some of the old Poets said, that the Gods were at first created by humane
Feare: which spoken of the Gods,(that is to say, of the many Gods of the
Gentiles) is very true. But the acknowledging of one God Eternall, Infinite, and
Omnipotent, may more easily be derived, from the desire men have to know the
causes of naturall bodies, and their severall vertues, and operations; than from
the feare of what was to befall them in time to come. For he that from any
effect hee seeth come to passe, should reason to the next and immediate cause
thereof, and from thence to the cause of that cause, and plonge himselfe
profoundly in the pursuit of causes; shall at last come to this, that there must
be (as even the Heathen Philosophers confessed) one First Mover; that is, a
First, and an Eternall cause of all things; which is that which men mean by the
name of God: And all this without thought of their fortune; the solicitude
whereof, both enclines to fear, and hinders them from the search of the causes
of other things; and thereby gives occasion of feigning of as many Gods, as
there be men that feigne them.

{#7} #_And suppose them Incorporeall._# And for the matter, or substance of the
Invisible Agents, so fancyed; they could not by naturall cogitation, fall upon
any other conceipt, but that it was the same with that of the Soule of man; and
that the Soule of man, was of the same substance, with that which appeareth in a
Dream, to one that sleepeth; or in a Looking-glasse, to one that is awake;
which, men not knowing that such apparitions are nothing else but creatures of
the Fancy, think to be reall, and externall Substances; and therefore call them
Ghosts; as the Latines called them _Imagines_, and _Umbr{ae}_; and thought them
Spirits, that is, thin aëreall bodies; and those Invisible Agents, which they
feared, to bee like them; save that they appear, and vanish when they please.
But the opinion that such Spirits were Incorporeall, or Immateriall, could never
enter into the mind of any man by nature; because, though men may put together
words of contradictory signification, as _Spirit_, and _Incorporeall_; yet they
can never have the imagination of any thing answering to them: And therefore,
men that by their own meditation, arrive to the acknowledgement of one Infinite,
Omnipotent, and Eternall God, choose rather to confesse he is Incomprehensible,
and above their understanding; than to define his Nature by _Spirit
Incorporeall_, and then confesse their definition to be unintelligible: or if
they give him such a title, it is not _Dogmatically_, with intention to make the
Divine Nature understood; but _Piously_, to honour him with attributes, of
significations, as remote as they can from the grossenesse of Bodies Visible.

{#8} #_But know not the way how they effect any thing._# Then, for the way by
which they think these Invisible Agents wrought their effects; that is to say,
what immediate causes they used, in bringing things to passe, men that know not
what it is that we call _causing_, (that is, almost all men) have no other rule
to guesse by, but by observing, and remembring what they have seen to precede
the like effect at some other time, or times before, without seeing between the
antecedent and subsequent Event, any dependance or connexion at all: And
therefore from the like things past, they expect the like things to come; and
hope for good or evill luck, superstitiously, from things that have no part at
all in the causing of it: As the Athenians did for their war at _Lepanto_,
demand another _Phormio_; The Pompeian faction for their warre in _Afrique_,
another _Scipio_; and others have done in divers other occasions since. In like
manner they attribute their fortune to a stander by, to a lucky or unlucky
place, to words spoken, especially if the name of God be amongst them; as
Charming, and Conjuring (the Leiturgy of Witches;) insomuch as to believe, they
have power to turn a stone into bread, bread into a man, or any thing, into any
thing.

{#9} #_But honour them as they honour men._# Thirdly, for the worship which
naturally men exhibite to Powers invisible, it can be no other, but such
expressions of their reverence, as they would use towards men; Gifts, Petitions,
Thanks, Submission of Body, Considerate Addresses, sober Behaviour, premeditated
Words, Swearing (that is, assuring one another of their promises,) by invoking
them. Beyond that reason suggesteth nothing; but leaves them either to rest
there; or for further ceremonies, to rely on those they believe to be wiser than
themselves.

{#10} Lastly, concerning how these Invisible Powers declare#_And attribute to
them all extraordinary events._# to men the things which shall hereafter come to
passe, especially concerning their good or evill fortune in generall, or good or
ill successe in any particular undertaking, men are naturally at a stand; save
that using to conjecture of the time to come, by the time past, they are very
apt, not onely to take casuall things, after one or two encounters, for
Prognostiques of the like encounter ever after, but also to believe the like
Prognostiques from other men, of whom they have once conceived a good opinion.

{#11} And in these foure things, Opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance#_Foure things,
Naturall seeds of Religion._# of second causes, Devotion towards what men fear,
and Taking of things Casuall for Prognostiques, consisteth the Naturall seed of
_Religion_; which by reason of the different Fancies, Judgements, and Passions
of severall men, hath grown up into ceremonies so different, that those which
are used by one man, are for the most part ridiculous to another.

{#12} For these seeds have received culture from two sorts#_Made different by
Culture._# of men. One sort have been they, that have nourished, and ordered
them, according to their own invention. The other, have done it, by Gods
commandement, and direction: but both sorts have done it, with a purpose to make
those men that relyed on them, the more apt to Obedience, Lawes, Peace, Charity,
and civill Society. So that the Religion of the former sort, is a part of humane
Politiques; and teacheth part of the duty which Earthly Kings require of their
Subjects. And the Religion of the later sort is Divine Politiques; and
containeth Precepts to those that have yeelded themselves subjects in the
Kingdome of God. Of the former sort, were all the founders of Common-wealths,
and the Law-givers of the Gentiles: Of the later sort, were _Abraham, Moses_,
and our _Blessed Saviour_; by whom have been derived unto us the Lawes of the
Kingdome of God.

{#13} #_The absurd opinion of Gentilisme._# And for that part of Religion, which
consisteth in opinions concerning the nature of Powers Invisible, there is
almost nothing that has a name, that has not been steemed amongst the Gentiles,
in one place or another, a God, or Divell; or by their Poets feigned to be
inanimated, inhabited, or possessed by some Spirit or other.

{#14} The unformed matter of the World, was a God, by the name of _Chaos_.

{#15} The Heaven, the Ocean, the Planets, the Fire, the Earth, the Winds, were
so many Gods.

{#16} Men, Women, a Bird, a Crocodile, a Calf, a Dogge, a Snake, an Onion, a
Leeke, Deified. Besides, that they filled almost all places, with spirits called
_D{oe}mons_: the plains, with _Pan_, and _Panises_, or Satyres; the Woods, with
Fawnes, and Nymphs; the Sea, with Tritons, and other Nymphs; every River, and
Fountayn, with a Ghost of his name, and with Nymphs; every house, with its
_Lares_, or Familiars; every man, with his _Genius_; Hell, with Ghosts, and
spirituall Officers, as _Charon, Cerberus_, and the _Furies_; and in the night
time, all places with _Larv{oe}, Lemures_, Ghosts of men deceased, and a whole
kingdome of Fayries, and Bugbears. They have also ascribed Divinity, and built
Temples to meer Accidents, and Qualities; such as are Time, Night, Day, Peace,
Concord, Love, Contention, Vertue, Honour, Health, Rust, Fever, and the like;
which when they prayed for, or against, they prayed to, as if there were Ghosts
of those names hanging over their heads, and letting fall, or withholding that
Good, or Evill, for, or against which they prayed. They invoked also their own
Wit, by the name of _Muses_; their own Ignorance, by the name of _Fortune_;
their own Lust, by the name of _Cupid_; their own Rage, by the name _Furies_;
their own privy members by the name of _Priapus_; and attributed their
pollutions, to _Incubi_, and _Succub{ae}_: insomuch as there was nothing, which
a Poet could introduce as a person in his Poem, which they did not make either a
_God_, or a _Divel_.

{#17} The same authors of the Religion of the Gentiles, observing the second
ground for Religion, which is mens Ignorance of causes; and thereby their
aptnesse to attribute their fortune to causes, on which there was no dependance
at all apparent, took occasion to obtrude on their ignorance, in stead of second
causes, a kind of second and ministeriall Gods; ascribing the cause of
F{oe}cundity, to _Venus_; the cause of Arts, to _Apollo_; of Subtilty and Craft,
to _Mercury_; of Tempests and stormes, to _{AE}olus_; and of other effects, to
other Gods: insomuch as there was amongst the Heathen almost as great variety of
Gods, as of businesse.

{#18} And to the Worship, which naturally men conceived fit to bee used towards
their Gods, namely Oblations, Prayers, Thanks, and the rest formerly named; the
same Legislators of the Gentiles have added their Images, both in Picture, and
Sculpture; that the more ignorant sort, (that is to say, the most part, or
generality of the people,) thinking the Gods for whose representation they were
made, were really included, and as it were housed within them, might so much the
more stand in feare of them: And endowed them with lands, and houses, and
officers, and revenues, set apart from all other humane uses; that is,
consecrated, and made holy to those their Idols; as Caverns, Groves, Woods,
Mountains, and whole Ilands; and have attributed to them, not onely the shapes,
some of Men, some of Beasts, some of Monsters; but also the Faculties, and
Passions of men and beasts; as Sense, Speech, Sex, Lust, Generation, (and this
not onely by mixing one with another, to propagate the kind of Gods; but also by
mixing with men, and women, to beget mongrill Gods, and but inmates of Heaven,
as _Bacchus, Hercules_, and others;) besides, Anger, Revenge, and other passions
of living creatures, and the actions proceeding from them, as Fraud, Theft,
Adultery, Sodomie, and any vice that may be taken for an effect of Power, or a
cause of Pleasure; and all such Vices, as amongst men are taken to be against
Law, rather than against Honour.

{#19} Lastly, to the Prognostiques of time to come; which are naturally, but
Conjectures upon the Experience of time past; and supernaturally, divine
Revelation; the same authors of the Religion of the Gentiles, partly upon
pretended Experience, partly upon pretended Revelation, have added innumerable
other superstitious wayes of Divination; and made men believe they should find
their fortunes, sometimes in the ambiguous or senslesse answers of the Priests
at _Delphi, Delos, Ammon_, and other famous Oracles; which answers, were made
ambiguous by designe, to own the event both wayes; or absurd, by the
intoxicating vapour of the place, which is very frequent in sulphurous Cavernes:
Sometimes in the leaves of the Sibills; of whose Prophecyes (like those perhaps
of _Nostradamus_; for the fragments now extant seem to be the invention of later
times) there were some books in reputation in the time of the Roman Republique:
Sometimes in the insignificant Speeches of Mad-men, supposed to be possessed
with a divine Spirit; which Possession they called Enthusiasme; and these kinds
of foretelling events, were accounted Theomancy, or Prophecy: Sometimes in the
aspect of the Starres at their Nativity; which was called Horoscopy, and
esteemed a part of judiciary Astrology: Sometimes in their own hopes and feares,
called Thumomancy, or Presage: Sometimes in the Prediction of Witches, that
pretended conference with the dead; which is called Necromancy, Conjuring, and
Witchcraft; and is but juggling and confederate knavery; Sometimes in the
Casuall flight, or feeding of birds; called Augury: Sometimes in the Entrayles
of a sacrificed beast; which was _Aruspicina_: Sometimes in Dreams: Sometimes in
Croaking of Ravens, or chattering of Birds: Sometimes in the Lineaments of the
face; which was called Metoposcopy; or by Palmistry in the lines of the hand; in
casuall words, called _Omina_: Sometimes in Monsters, or unusuall accidents; as
Ecclipses, Comets, rare Meteors, Earthquakes, Inundations, uncouth Births, and
the like, which they called _Portenta_, and _Ostenta_, because they thought them
to portend, or foreshew some great Calamity to come: Somtimes, in meer Lottery,
as Crosse and Pile; counting holes in a sive; dipping of Verses in _Homer_, and
_Virgil_; and innumerable other such vaine conceipts. So easie are men to be
drawn to believe any thing, from such men as have gotten credit with them; and
can with gentlenesse, and dexterity, take hold of their fear, and ignorance.

{#20} And therefore the first Founders, and Legislators of#_The designes of the
Authors of the Religion of the Heathen._# Common-wealths amongst the Gentiles,
whose ends were only to keep the people in obedience, and peace, have in all
places taken care; First, to imprint in their minds a beliefe, that those
precepts which they gave concerning Religion, might not be thought to proceed
from their own device, but from the dictates of some God, or other Spirit; or
else that they themselves were of a higher nature than mere mortalls, that their
Lawes might the more easily be received: So _Numa Pompilius_ pretended to
receive the Ceremonies he instituted amongst the Romans, from the Nymph
_Egeria_: and the first King and founder of the Kingdome of _Peru_, pretended
himselfe and his wife to be the children of the Sunne: and _Mahomet_, to set up
his new Religion, pretended to have conferences with the Holy Ghost, in forme of
a Dove. Secondly, they have had a care, to make it believed, that the same
things were displeasing to the Gods, which were forbidden by the Lawes. Thirdly,
to prescribe Ceremonies, Supplications, Sacrifices, and Festivalls, by which
they were to believe, the anger of the Gods might be appeased; and that ill
success in War, great contagions of Sicknesse, Earthquakes, and each mans
private Misery, came from the Anger of the Gods; and their Anger from the
Neglect of their Worship, or the forgetting, or mistaking some point of the
Ceremonies required. And though amongst the antient Romans, men were not
forbidden to deny, that which in the Poets is written of the paines, and
pleasures after this life; which divers of great authority, and gravity in that
state have in their _Harangues_ openly derided; yet that beliefe was alwaies
more cherished, than the contrary.

{#21} And by these, and such other Institutions, they obtayned in order to their
end, (which was the peace of the Commonwealth,) that the common people in their
misfortunes, laying the fault on neglect, or errour in their Ceremonies, or on
their own disobedience to the lawes, were the lesse apt to mutiny against their
Governors. And being entertained with the pomp, and pastime of Festivalls, and
publike Games, made in honour of the Gods, needed nothing else but bread, to
keep them from discontent, murmuring, and commotion against the State. And
therefore the Romans, that had conquered the greatest part of the then known
World, made no scruple of tollerating any Religion whatsoever in the City of
_Rome_ it selfe; unlesse it had something in it, that could not consist with
their Civill Government; nor do we read, that any Religion was there forbidden,
but that of the Jewes; who (being the peculiar Kingdome of God) thought it
unlawfull to acknowledge subjection to any mortall King or State whatsoever. And
thus you see how the Religion of the Gentiles was a part of their Policy.

{#22} But where God himselfe, by supernaturall Revelation, planted Religion;
there he also made to himselfe a peculiar Kingdome; and gave Lawes, not only of
behaviour towards himselfe; but also towards one another; and thereby in the
Kingdome of God, the Policy, and lawes Civill, are a part of Religion; and#_The
true Religion, and the lawes of Gods kingdome the same._# therefore the
distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall Domination, hath there no place. It is
true, that God is King of all the Earth: Yet may he be King of a peculiar, and
chosen Nation. For there is no more incongruity there in, than that he that hath
the generall command of the whole Army, should have withall a peculiar Regiment,
or Company of his own. God is King of all the Earth by his Power: but of his
chosen people, he is King by Covenant. But to speake more largly of the Kingdome
of God, both by Nature, and#_Chap. 35._# Covenant, I have in the following
discourse assigned an other place.

{#23} #_The causes of Change in Religion._# From the propagation of Religion, it
is not hard to understand the causes of the resolution of the same into its
first seeds, or principles; which are only an opinion of a Deity, and Powers
invisible, and super-naturall; that can never be so abolished out of humane
nature, but that new Religions may againe be made to spring out of them, by the
culture of such men, as for such purpose are in reputation.

{#24} For seeing all formed Religion, is founded at first, upon the faith which
a multitude hath in some one person, whom they believe not only to be a wise
man, and to labour to procure their happiness, but also to be a holy man, to
whom God himselfe vouchsafeth to declare his will supernaturally; It followeth
necessarily, when they that have the Goverment of Religion, shall come to have
either the wisedome of those men, their sincerity, or their love suspected; or
that they shall be anable to shew any probable token of Divine Revelation; that
the Religion which they desire to uphold, must be suspected likewise; and
(without the feare of the Civill Sword) contradicted and rejected.

{#25} That which taketh away the reputation of Wisedome,#_Injoyning beleefe of
Impossibilities._# in him that formeth a Religion, or addeth to it when it is
allready formed, is the enjoyning of a beliefe of contradictories: For both
parts of a contradiction cannot possibly be true: and therefore to enjoyne the
beliefe of them, is an argument of ignorance; which detects the Author in that;
and discredits him in all things else he shall propound as from revelation
supernaturall: which revelation a man may indeed have of many things above, but
of nothing against naturall reason.

{#26} That which taketh away the reputation of Sincerity,#_Doing contrary to the
Religion they establish._# is the doing, or saying of such things, as appeare to
be signes, that what they require other men to believe, is not believed by
themselves; all which doings, or sayings are therefore called Scandalous,
because they be stumbling blocks, that make men to fall in the way of Religion:
as Injustice, Cruelty, Prophanesse, Avarice, and Luxury. For who can believe,
that he that doth ordinarily such actions, as proceed from any of these rootes,
believeth there is any such Invisible Power to be feared, as he affrighteth
other men withall, for lesser faults?

{#27} That which taketh away the reputation of Love, is the being detected of
private ends: as when the beliefe they require of others, conduceth or seemeth
to conduce to the acquiring of Dominion, Riches, Dignity, or secure leasure, to
themselves onely, or specially. For that which men reap benefit by to
themselves, they are thought to do for their own sakes, and not for love of
others.

{#28} #_Want of the testimony of Miracles._# Lastly, the testimony that men can
render of divine Calling, can be no other, than the operation of Miracles; or
true Prophecy, (which also is a Miracle;) or extraordinary Felicity. And
therefore, to those points of Religion, which have been received from them that
did such Miracles; those that are added by such, as approve not their Calling by
some Miracle, obtain no greater beliefe, than what the Custome, and Lawes of the
places, in which they be educated, have wrought into them. For as in naturall
things, men of judgement require naturall signes, and arguments; so in
supernaturall things, they require signes supernaturall, (which are Miracles,)
before they consent inwardly, and from their hearts.

{#29} All which causes of the weakening of mens faith, do manifestly appear in
the Examples following. First, we have the Example of the children of Israel;
who when _Moses_, that had approved his Calling to them by Miracles, and by the
happy conduct of them out of _Egypt_, was absent but 40. dayes, revolted from
the worship of the true God, recommended to them by him; and setting up
#_Exod_. 32. 1, 2.# a Golden Calfe for their God, relapsed into the Idolatry
of the Egyptians; from whom they had been so lately delivered. And again, after
_Moses, Aaron, Joshua_, and that generation which had seen the great works of
God in Israel, #_Judges_ 2. 11.# were dead; another generation arose, and
served _Baal_. So that Miracles fayling, Faith also failed.

{#30} Again, when the sons of _Samuel_, #_1 Sam_. 8. 3.# being constituted by
their father Judges in _Bersabee_, received bribes, and judged unjustly, the
people of Israel refused any more to have God to be their King, in other manner
than he was King of other people; and therefore cryed out to _Samuel_, to choose
them a King after the manner of the Nations. So that Justice fayling, Faith also
fayled: Insomuch, as they deposed their God, from reigning over them.

{#31} And whereas in the planting of Christian Religion, the Oracles ceased in
all parts of the Roman Empire, and the number of Christians encreased
wonderfully every day, and in every place, by the preaching of the Apostles, and
Evangelists; a great part of that successe, may reasonably be attributed, to the
contempt, into which the Priests of the Gentiles of that time, had brought
themselves, by their uncleannesse, avarice, and jugling between Princes. Also
the Religion of the Church of _Rome_, was partly, for the same cause abolished
in _England_, and many other parts of Christendome; insomuch, as the fayling of
Vertue in the Pastors, maketh Faith faile in the People: and partly from
bringing of the Philosophy, and doctrine of _Aristotle_ into Religion, by the
Schoole-men; from whence there arose so many contradictions, and absurdities, as
brought the Clergy into a reputation both of Ignorance, and of Fraudulent
intention; and enclined people to revolt from them, either against the will of
their own Princes, as in _France_, and _Holland_; or with their will, as in
_England_.

{#32} Lastly, amongst the points by the Church of _Rome_ declared necessary for
Salvation, there be so many, manifestly to the advantage of the Pope, and of his
spirituall subjects, residing in the territories of other Christian Princes,
that were it not for the mutuall emulation of those Princes, they might without
warre, or trouble, exclude all forraign Authority, as easily as it has been
excluded in _England_. For who is there that does not see, to whose benefit it
conduceth, to have it believed, that a King hath not his Authority from Christ,
unlesse a Bishop crown him? That a King, if he be a Priest, cannot Marry? That
whether a Prince be born in lawfull Marriage, or not, must be judged by
Authority from _Rome_? That Subjects may be freed from their Alleageance, if by
the Court of _Rome_, the King be judged an Heretique? That a King (as
_Chilperique_ of _France_) may be deposed by a Pope (as Pope _Zachary_,) for no
cause; and his Kingdome given to one of his Subjects? That the Clergy, and
Regulars, in what Country soever, shall be exempt from the Jurisdiction of their
King, in cases criminall? Or who does not see, to whose profit redound the Fees
of private Masses, and Vales of Purgatory; with other signes of private
interest, enough to mortifie the most lively Faith, if (as I sayd) the civill
Magistrate, and Custome did not more sustain it, than any opinion they have of
the Sanctify, Wisdome, or Probity of their Teachers? So that I may attribute all
the changes of Religion in the world, to one and the same cause; and that is,
unpleasing Priests; and those not onely amongst Catholiques, but even in that
Church that hath presumed most of Reformation.
