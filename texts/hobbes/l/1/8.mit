£1 _Of the ^Vertues^ commonly called ^Intellectuall^; and their contrary
^Defects^._ £1

{#1} #_Intellectuall Vertue defined._#^Vertue^ generally, in all sorts of
subjects, is somewhat that is valued for eminence; and consisteth in comparison.
For if all things were equally in all men, nothing would be prized. And by
_Vertues_ ^Intellectuall^, are alwayes understood such abilityes of the mind, as
men praise, value, and desire should be in themselves; and go commonly under the
name of a _good wit_; though the same word ^Wit^, be used also, to distinguish
one certain ability from the rest.

{#2} #_Wit, Naturall, or Acquired._# These _Vertues_ are of two sorts;
_Naturall_, and _Acquired_. By Naturall, I mean not, that which a man hath from
his Birth: for that is nothing else but Sense; wherein men differ so little one
from another, and from brute Beasts, as it is not to be reckoned amongst
Vertues. But I mean, that _Wit_, which is gotten by Use onely, and Experience;
without Method, Culture, or Instruction. This ^Naturall^ ^Wit^, consisteth
principally in two things;#_Naturall Wit._# _Celerity of Imagining_, (that is,
swift succession of one thought to another;) and _steddy direction_ to some
approved end. On the Contrary a slow Imagination, maketh that Defect, or fault
of the mind, which is commonly called ^Dulnesse^, _Stupidity_, and sometimes by
other names that signifie slownesse of motion, or difficulty to be moved.

{#3} And this difference of quicknesse, is caused by the difference of mens
passions; that love and dislike, some one thing, some another; and therefore
some mens thoughts run one way, some another; and are held to, and observe
differently the things that passe through their imagination. And whereas in this
succession of mens thoughts, there is nothing to observe in the things they
think on, but either in what they be _like one another_, or in what they be
_unlike_, or _what they serve for_, or _how they serve to such a purpose_; Those
that observe their similitudes, in case they be such as are but rarely observed
by others, are sayd to have a _Good Wit_; by which, in#_Good Wit, or Fancy._#
this occasion, is meant a _Good Fancy_. But they that observe their differences,
and dissimilitudes; which is called _Distinguishing_, and _Discerning_, and
_Judging_ between thing and thing; in case, such discerning be not easie, are
said to have a _good Judgement_: and particularly#_Good Judgement._# in matter
of conversation and businesse; wherein, times, places, and persons are to be
discerned, this Vertue is called ^Discretion^. The former, that is, Fancy,
without#_Discretion._# the help of Judgement, is not commended as a Vertue: but
the later which is Judgement, and Discretion, is commended for it selfe, without
the help of Fancy. Besides the Discretion of times, places, and persons,
necessary to a good Fancy, there is required also an often application of his
thoughts to their End; that is to say, to some use to be made of them. This
done; he that hath this Vertue, will be easily fitted with similitudes, that
will please, not onely by illustration of his discourse, and adorning it with
new and apt metaphors; but also, by the rarity of their invention. But without
Steddinesse, and Direction to some End, a great Fancy is one kind of Madnesse;
such as they have, that entring into any discourse, are snatched from their
purpose, by every thing that comes in their thought, into so many, and so long
digressions, and Parentheses, that they utterly lose themselves: Which kind of
folly, I know no particular name for: but the cause of it is, sometimes want of
experience; whereby that seemeth to a man new and rare, which doth not so to
others: sometimes Pusillanimity; by which that seems great to him, which other
men think a trifle: and whatsoever is new, or great, and therefore thought fit
to be told, withdrawes a man by degrees from the intended way of his discourse.

{#4} In a good Poem, whether it be _Epique_, or _Dramatique_; as also in
_Sonnets, Epigrams_, and other Pieces, both Judgement and Fancy are required:
But the Fancy must be more eminent; because they please for the Extravagancy;
but ought not to displease by Indiscretion.

{#5} In a good History, the Judgement must be eminent; because the goodnesse
consisteth, in the Method, in the Truth, and in the Choyse of the actions that
are most profitable to be known. Fancy has no place, but onely in adorning the
stile.

{#6} In Orations of Prayse, and in Invectives, the Fancy is pr{ae}dominant;
because the designe is not truth, but to Honour or Dishonour; which is done by
noble, or by vile comparisons. The Judgement does but suggest what circumstances
make an action laudable, or culpable.

{#7} In Hortatives, and Pleadings, as Truth, or Disguise serveth best to the
Designe in hand; so is the Judgement, or the Fancy most required.

{#8} In Demonstration, in Councell, and all rigourous search of Truth, Judgement
does all; except sometimes the understanding have need to be opened by some apt
similitude; and then there is so much use of Fancy. But for Metaphors, they are
in this case utterly excluded. For seeing they openly professe deceipt; to admit
them into Councell, or Reasoning, were manifest folly.

{#9} And in any Discourse whatsoever, if the defect of Discretion be apparent,
how extravagant soever the Fancy be, the whole discourse will be taken for a
signe of want of wit; and so will it never when the Discretion is manifest,
though the Fancy be never so ordinary.

{#10} The secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane, clean,
obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verball discourse
cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the Time, Place, and
Persons. An Anatomist, or a Physitian may speak, or write his judgement of
unclean things; because it is not to please, but profit: but for another man to
write his extravagant, and pleasant fancies of the same, is as if a man, from
being tumbled into the dirt, should come and present himselfe before good
company. And 'tis the want of Discretion that makes the difference. Again, in
profest remissnesse of mind, and familiar company, a man may play with the
sounds, and {ae}quivocall significations of words; and that many times with
encounters of extraordinary Fancy: but in a Sermon, or in publique, or before
persons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no Gingling of words
that will not be accounted folly: and the difference is onely in the want of
Discretion. So that where Wit is wanting, it is not Fancy that is wanting, but
Discretion. Judgement therefore without Fancy is Wit, but Fancy without
Judgement not.

{#11} When the thoughts of a man, that has a designe in hand, running over a
multitude of things, observes how they conduce to that designe; or what designe
they may conduce unto; if his observations be such as are not easie, or usuall,
This wit of his is called ^Prudence^;#_Prudence._# and dependeth on much
Experience, and Memory of the like things, and their consequences heretofore. In
which there is not so much difference of Men, as there is in their Fancies and
Judgements; Because the Experience of men equall in age, is not much unequall,
as to the quantity; but lyes in different occasions; every one having his
private designes. To govern well a family, and a kingdome, are not different
degrees of Prudence; but different sorts of businesse; no more then to draw a
picture in little, or as great, or greater then the life, are different degrees
of Art. A plain husband-man is more Prudent in affaires of his own house, then a
Privy Counseller in the affaires of another man.

{#12} To Prudence, if you adde the use of unjust, or dishonest means, such as
usually are prompted to men by Feare, or Want; you have that Crooked Wisdome,
which is#_Craft._# called ^Craft^; which is a signe of Pusillanimity. For
Magnanimity is contempt of unjust, or dishonest helps. And that which the
Latines call _Versutia_, (translated into English, _Shifting_,) and is a putting
off of a present danger or incommodity, by engaging into a greater, as when a
man robbs one to pay another, is but a shorter sighted Craft, called _Versutia_,
from _Versura_, which signifies taking mony at usurie, for the present payment
of interest.

{#13} #_Acquired Wit._# As for _acquired Wit_, (I mean acquired by method and
instruction,) there is none but Reason; which is grounded on the right use of
Speech; and produceth the Sciences. But of Reason and Science, I have already
spoken in the fifth and sixth Chapters.

{#14} The causes of this difference of Witts, are in the Passions: and the
difference of Passions, proceedeth partly from the different Constitution of the
body, and partly from different Education. For if the difference proceeded from
the temper of the brain, and the organs of Sense, either exterior or interior,
there would be no lesse difference of men in their Sight, Hearing, or other
Senses, than in their Fancies, and Discretions. It proceeds therefore from the
Passions; which are different, not onely from the difference of mens
complexions; but also from their difference of customes, and education.

{#15} The Passions that most of all cause the differences of Wit, are
principally, the more or lesse Desire of Power, of Riches, of Knowledge, and of
Honour. All which may be reduced to the first, that is Desire of Power. For
Riches, Knowledge and Honour are but severall sorts of Power.

{#16} And therefore, a man who has no great Passion for any of these things; but
is as men terme it indifferent; though he may be so farre a good man, as to be
free from giving offence; yet he cannot possibly have either a great Fancy, or
much Judgement. For the Thoughts, are to the Desires, as Scouts, and Spies, to
range abroad, and find the way to the things Desired: All Stedinesse of the
minds motion, and all quicknesse of the same, proceeding from thence. For as to
have no Desire, is to be Dead: so to have weak Passions, is Dulnesse; and to
have Passions indifferently for every thing, ^Giddinesse^,#_Giddinesse._# and
_Distraction_; and to have stronger, and more vehement Passions for any thing,
than is ordinarily seen in others, is that which men call
^Madnesse^.#_Madnesse._#

{#17} Whereof there be almost as many kinds, as of the Passions themselves.
Sometimes the extraordinary and extravagant Passion, proceedeth from the evill
constitution of the organs of the Body, or harme done them; and sometimes the
hurt, and indisposition of the Organs, is caused by the vehemence, or long
continuance of the Passion. But in both cases the Madnesse is of one and the
same nature.

{#18} The Passion, whose violence, or continuance maketh Madnesse, is either
great _vaine-Glory_; which is commonly called _Pride_, and _selfe-conceipt_; or
great _Dejection_ of mind.

{#19} Pride, subjecteth a man to Anger, the excesse whereof, is the Madnesse
called ^Rage^, and ^Fury^. And thus#_Rage._# it comes to passe that excessive
desire of Revenge, when it becomes habituall, hurteth the organs, and becomes
Rage: That excessive love, with jealousie, becomes also Rage: Excessive opinion
of a mans own selfe, for divine inspiration, for wisdome, learning, forme, and
the like, becomes Distraction, and Giddinesse: The same, joyned with Envy, Rage:
Vehement opinion of the truth of any thing, contradicted by others, Rage.

{#20} Dejection, subjects a man to causelesse fears; which is a Madnesse
commonly called ^Melancholy^, apparent#_Melancholy._# also in divers manners; as
in haunting of solitudes, and graves; in superstitious behaviour; and in fearing
some one, some another particular thing. In summe, all Passions that produce
strange and unusuall behaviour, are called by the generall name of Madnesse. But
of the severall kinds of Madnesse, he that would take the paines, might enrowle
a legion. And if the Excesses be madnesse, there is no doubt but the Passions
themselves, when they tend to Evill, are degrees of the same.

{#21} (For example,) Though the effect of folly, in them that are possessed of
an opinion of being inspired, be not visible alwayes in one man, by any very
extravagant action, that proceedeth from such Passion; yet when many of them
conspire together, the Rage of the whole multitude is visible enough. For what
argument of Madnesse can there be greater, than to clamour, strike, and throw
stones at our best friends? Yet this is somewhat lesse than such a multitude
will do. For they will clamour, fight against, and destroy those, by whom all
their life-time before, they have been protected, and secured from injury. And
if this be Madnesse in the multitude, it is the same in every particular man.
For as in the middest of the sea, though a man perceive no sound of that part of
the water next him; yet he is well assured, that part contributes as much, to
the Roaring of the Sea, as any other part, of the same quantity: so also, though
wee perceive no great unquietnesse, in one, or two men; yet we may be well
assured, that their singular Passions, are parts of the Seditious roaring of a
troubled Nation. And if there were nothing else that bewrayed their madnesse;
yet that very arrogating such inspiration to themselves, is argument enough. If
some man in Bedlam should entertaine you with sober discourse; and you desire in
taking leave, to know what he were, that you might another time requite his
civility; and he should tell you, he were God the Father; I think you need
expect no extravagant action for argument of his Madnesse.

{#22} This opinion of Inspiration, called commonly, Private Spirit, begins very
often, from some lucky finding of an Errour generally held by others; and not
knowing, or not remembring, by what conduct of reason, they came to so singular
a truth, (as they think it, though it be many times an untruth they light on,)
they presently admire themselves; as being in the speciall grace of God
Almighty, who hath revealed the same to them supernaturally, by his Spirit.

{#23} Again, that Madnesse is nothing else, but too much appearing Passion, may
be gathered out of the effects of Wine, which are the same with those of the
evill disposition of the organs. For the variety of behaviour in men that have
drunk too much, is the same with that of Mad-men: some of them Raging, others
Loving, others Laughing, all extravagantly, but according to their severall
domineering Passions: For the effect of the wine, does but remove Dissimulation;
and take from them the sight of the deformity of their Passions. For, (I
believe) the most sober men, when they walk alone without care and employment of
the mind, would be unwilling the vanity and Extravagance of their thoughts at
that time should be publiquely seen: which is a confession, that Passions
unguided, are for the most part meere Madnesse.

{#24} The opinions of the world, both in antient and later ages, concerning the
cause of madnesse, have been two. Some, deriving them from the Passions; some,
from D{ae}mons, or Spirits, either good, or bad, which they thought might enter
into a man, possesse him, and move his organs in such strange, and uncouth
manner, as mad-men use to do. The former sort therefore, called such men,
Mad-men: but the Later, called them sometimes _D{ae}moniacks_, (that is,
possessed with spirits;) sometimes _Energumeni_, (that is, agitated, or moved
with spirits;) and now in _Italy_ they are called not onely _Pazzi_, Mad-men;
but also _Spiritati_, men possest.

{#25} There was once a great conflux of people in _Abdera_, a City of the
Greeks, at the acting of the Tragedy of _Andromeda_, upon an extream hot day:
whereupon, a great many of the spectators falling into Fevers, had this accident
from the heat, and from the Tragedy together, that they did nothing but
pronounce Iambiques, with the names of _Perseus_ and _Andromeda_; which together
with the Fever, was cured, by the comming on of Winter: And this madnesse was
thought to proceed from the Passion imprinted by the Tragedy. Likewise there
raigned a fit of madnesse in another Gr{ae}cian City, which seized onely the
young Maidens; and caused many of them to hang themselves. This was by most then
thought an act of the Divel. But one that suspected, that contempt of life in
them, might proceed from some Passion of the mind, and supposing they did not
contemne also their honour, gave counsell to the Magistrates, to strip such as
so hang' themselves, and let them hang out naked. This the story sayes cured
that madnesse. But on the other side, the same Gr{ae}cians, did often ascribe
madnesse, to the operation of the Eumenides, or Furyes; and sometimes of _Ceres,
Ph{oe}bus_, and other Gods: so much did men attribute to Phantasmes, as to think
them aëreal living bodies; and generally to call them Spirits. And as the Romans
in this, held the same opinion with the Greeks: so also did the Jewes; For they
called mad-men Prophets, or (according as they thought the spirits good or bad)
D{ae}moniacks; and some of them called both Prophets, and D{ae}moniacks mad-men;
and some called the same man both D{ae}moniack, and mad-man. But for the
Gentiles, 'tis no wonder; because Diseases, and Health; Vices, and Vertues; and
many naturall accidents, were with them termed, and worshipped as D{ae}mons. So
that a man was to understand by D{ae}mon, as well (sometimes) an Ague, as a
Divell. But for the Jewes to have such opinion, is somewhat strange. For neither
_Moses_, nor _Abraham_ pretended to Prophecy by possession of a Spirit; but from
the voyce of God; or by a Vision or Dream: Nor is there any thing in his Law,
Morall, or Ceremoniall, by which they were taught, there was any such
Enthusiasme; or any Possession. When God is sayd, _Numb_. 11. 25. to take from
the Spirit that was in _Moses_, and give to the 70. Elders, the Spirit of God
(taking it for the substance of God) is not divided. The Scriptures by the
Spirit of God in man, mean a mans spirit, enclined to Godlinesse. And where it
is said _Exod_. 28. 3. _Whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdome to make
garments for Aaron_, is not meant a spirit put into them, that can make
garments; but the wisdome of their own spirits in that kind of work. In the like
sense, the spirit of man, when it produceth unclean actions, is ordinarily
called an unclean spirit; and so other spirits, though not alwayes, yet as often
as the vertue or vice so stiled, is extraordinary, and Eminent. Neither did the
other Prophets of the old Testament pretend Enthusiasme; or, that God spake in
them; but to them by Voyce, Vision, or Dream; and the _Burthen of the Lord_ was
not Possession, but Command. How then could the Jewes fall into this opinion of
possession? I can imagine no reason, but that which is common to all men;
namely, the want of curiosity to search naturall causes; and their placing
Felicity, in the acquisition of the grosse pleasures of the Senses, and the
things that most immediately conduce thereto. For they that see any strange, and
unusuall ability, or defect in a mans mind; unlesse they see withall, from what
cause it may probably proceed, can hardly think it naturall; and if not
naturall, they must needs thinke it supernaturall; and then what can it be, but
that either God, or the Divell is in him? And hence it came to passe, when our
Saviour (_Mark_ 3. 21.) was compassed about with the multitude, those of the
house doubted he was mad, and went out to hold him: but the Scribes said he had
_Belzebub_, and that was it, by which he cast out divels; as if the greater
mad-man had awed the lesser. And that (_John_ 10. 20.) some said, _He hath a
Divell, and is mad_; whereas others holding him for a Prophet, sayd, _These are
not the words of one that hath a Divell_. So in the old Testament he that came
to anoynt _Jehu_, 2 _Kings_ 9. 11. was a Prophet; but some of the company asked
_Jehu, What came that mad-man for?_ So that in summe, it is manifest, that
whosoever behaved himselfe in extraordinory manner, was thought by the Jewes to
be possessed either with a good, or evill spirit; except by the Sadduces, who
erred so farre on the other hand, as not to believe there were at all any
spirits, (which is very neere to direct Atheisme;) and thereby perhaps the more
provoked others, to terme such men D{ae}moniacks, rather than mad-men.

{#26} But why then does our Saviour proceed in the curing of them, as if they
were possest; and not as if they were mad? To which I can give no other kind of
answer, but that which is given to those that urge the Scripture in like manner
against the opinion of the motion of the Earth. The Scripture was written to
shew unto men the kingdome of God; and to prepare their mindes to become his
obedient subjects; leaving the world, and the Philosophy thereof, to the
disputation of men, for the exercising of their naturall Reason. Whether the
Earths, or Suns motion make the day, and night; or whether the Exorbitant
actions of men, proceed from Passion, or from the Divell, (so we worship him
not) it is all one, as to our obedience, and subjection to God Almighty; which
is the thing for which the Scripture was written. As for that our Saviour
speaketh to the disease, as to a person; it is the usuall phrase of all that
cure by words onely, as Christ did, (and Inchanters pretend to do, whether they
speak to a Divel or not.) For is not Christ also said (_Math_. 8. 26.) to have
rebuked the winds? Is not he said also (_Luk_. 4. 39.) to rebuke a Fever? Yet
this does not argue that a Fever is a Divel. And whereas many of those Divels
are said to confesse Christ; it is not necessary to interpret those places
otherwise, than that those mad-men confessed him. And whereas our Saviour
(_Math_. 12. 43.) speaketh of an unclean Spirit, that having gone out of a man,
wandreth through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none; and returning into
the same man, with seven other spirits worse than himselfe; It is manifestly a
Parable, alluding to a man, that after a little endeavour to quit his lusts, is
vanquished by the strength of them; and becomes seven times worse than he was.
So that I see nothing at all in the Scripture, that requireth a beliefe, that
D{ae}moniacks were any other thing but Mad-men.

{#27} #_Insignificant Speech._# There is yet another fault in the Discourses of
some men; which may also be numbred amongst the sorts of Madnesse; namely, that
abuse of words, whereof I have spoken before in the fifth chapter, by the Name
of Absurdity. And that is, when men speak such words, as put together, have in
them no signification at all; but are fallen upon by some, through
misunderstanding of the words they have received, and repeat by rote; by others,
from intention to deceive by obscurity. And this is incident to none but those,
that converse in questions of matters incomprehensible, as the Schoole-men; or
in questions of abstruse Philosophy. The common sort of men seldome speak
Insignificantly, and are therefore, by those other Egregious persons counted
Idiots. But to be assured their words are without any thing correspondent to
them in the mind, there would need some Examples; which if any man require, let
him take a Schoole-man into his hands, and see if he can translate any one
chapter concerning any difficult point; as the Trinity; the Deity; the nature of
Christ; Transub-stantiation; Free-will, _&c_. into any of the moderne tongues,
so as to make the same intelligible; or into any tolerable Latine, such as they
were acquainted withall, that lived when the Latine tongue was Vulgar. What is
the meaning of these words. _The first cause does not necessarily inflow any
thing into the second, by force of the Essentiall subordination of the second
causes, by Which it may help it to worke_? They are the Translation of the Title
of the sixth chapter of _Suarez_ first Booke, _Of the Concourse, Motion, and
Help of God_. When men write whole volumes of such stuffe, are they not Mad, or
intend to make others so? And particularly, in the question of
Transubstantiation; where after certain words spoken, they that say, the
White_nesse_, Round_nesse_, Magni_tude_, Quali_ty_, Corruptibili_ty_, all which
are incorporeall, _&c_. go out of the Wafer, into the Body of our blessed
Saviour, do they not make those _Nesses, Tudes_, and _Ties_, to be so many
spirits possessing his body? For by Spirits, they mean alwayes things, that
being incorporeall, are neverthelesse moveable from one place to another. So
that this kind of Absurdity, may rightly be numbred amongst the many sorts of
Madnesse; and all the time that guided by clear Thoughts of their worldly lust,
they forbear disputing, or writing thus, but Lucide Intervals And thus much of
the Vertues and Defects Intellectuall.
