£1 _Of ^D{AE}monology^, and other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles._ £1

{#1} #_The Originall of D{ae}monology._# ^The^ impression made on the organs of
Sight, by lucide Bodies, either in one direct line, or in many lines, reflected
from Opaque, or refracted in the passage through Diaphanous Bodies, produceth in
living Creatures, in whom God hath placed such Organs, an Imagination of the
Object, from whence the Impression proceedeth; which Imagination is called
_Sight_; and seemeth not to bee a meer Imagination, but the Body it selfe
without us; in the same manner, as when a man violently presseth his eye, there
appears to him a light without, and before him, which no man perceiveth but
himselfe; because there is indeed no such thing without him, but onely a motion
in the interiour organs, pressing by resistance outward, that makes him think
so. And the motion made by this pressure, continuing after the object which
caused it is removed, is that we call _Imagination_, and _Memory_, and (in
sleep, and sometimes in great distemper of the organs by Sicknesse, or Violence)
a _Dream_: of which things I have already spoken briefly, in the second and
third Chapters.

{#2} This nature of Sight having never been discovered by the ancient pretenders
to Naturall Knowledge; much lesse by those that consider not things so remote
(as that Knowledge is) from their present use; it was hard for men to conceive
of those Images in the Fancy, and in the Sense, otherwise, than of things really
without us: Which some (because they vanish away, they know not whither, nor
how,) will have to be absolutely Incorporeall, that is to say Immateriall, or
Formes without Matter; Colour and Figure, without any coloured or figured Body;
and that they can put on Aiery bodies (as a garment) to make them Visible when
they will to our bodily Eyes; and others say, are Bodies, and living Creatures.
but made of Air, or other more subtile and {ae}thereall Matter, which is, then,
when they will be seen, condensed. But Both of them agree on one generall
appellation of them, ^D{AE}mons^. As if the Dead of whom they Dreamed, were not
Inhabitants of their own Brain, but of the Air, or of Heaven, or Hell; not
Phantasmes, but Ghosts; with just as much reason, as if one should say, he saw
his own Ghost in a Looking-Glasse, or the Ghosts of the Stars in a River; or
call the ordinary apparition of the Sun, of the quantity of about a foot, the
_D{ae}mon_, or Ghost of that great Sun that enlighteneth the whole visible
world: And by that means have feared them, as things of an unknown, that is, of
an unlimited power to doe them good, or harme; and consequently, given occasion
to the Governours of the Heathen Common-wealths to regulate this their fear, by
establishing that ^D{AE}monology^ (in which the Poets, as Principall Priests of
the Heathen Religion, were specially employed, or reverenced) to the Publique
Peace, and to the Obedience of Subjects necessary thereunto; and to make some of
them Good _D{ae}mons_, and others Evill; the one as a Spurre to the Observance,
the other, as Reines to withhold them from Violation of the Laws.

{#3} What kind of things they were, to whom they attributed the name of
_D{ae}mons_, appeareth partly in the Genealogie of their Gods, written by
_Hesiod_, one of the most ancient Poets of the Gr{ae}cians; and partly in other
Histories; of which I have observed some few before, in the 12. Chapter of this
discourse.

{#4} The Gr{ae}cians, by their Colonies and Conquests, communicated#_How that
Doctrine was spread._# their Language and Writings into Asia, Egypt, and Italy;
and therein, by necessary consequence their _D{ae}monology_, or (as St. _Paul_
calles it) _their Doctrines of Devils_: And by that meanes, the contagion was
derived also to the Jewes, both of _Jud{ae}a_, and _Alexandria_, and other
parts, whereinto they were dispersed. But the name of _D{ae}mon_ they did not
(as the Gr{ae}cians)#_How far received by the Jews._# attribute to Spirits both
Good, and Evill; but to the Evill onely: And to the Good _D{ae}mons_ they gave
the name of the Spirit of God; and esteemed those into whose bodies they entred
to be Prophets. In summe, all singularity if Good, they attributed to the Spirit
of God; and if Evill, to some _D{ae}mon_, but a κακοδάιμων an Evill _D{ae}mon_,
that is, a _Devill_. And therefore, they called _D{ae}moniaques_, that is,
_possessed by the Devill_, such as we call Madmen or Lunatiques; or such as had
the Falling Sicknesse; or that spoke any thing, which they for want of
understanding, thought absurd: As also of an Unclean person in a notorious
degree, they used to say he had an Unclean Spirit; of a Dumbe man, that he had a
Dumbe Devill; and of _John Baptist_ (_Math_. 11. 18) for the singularity of his
fasting, that he had a Devill; and of our Saviour, because he said, hee that
keepeth#_John 8. 52._# his sayings should not see Death _in {ae}ternum, Now we
know thou hast a Devill; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead_: And again,
because he said (_John_ 7. 20.) _They went about to kill him_, the people
answered, _Thou hast a Devill, who goeth about to kill thee?_ Whereby it is
manifest, that the Jewes had the same opinions concerning Phantasmes, namely,
that they were not Phantasmes, that is, Idols of the braine, but things reall,
and independent on the Fancy.

{#5} #_Why our Saviour controlled it not._# Which doctrine if it be not true,
why (may some say) did not our Saviour contradict it, and teach the contrary?
nay why does he use on diverse occasions, such forms of speech as seem to
confirm it? To this I answer, that first, where Christ saith, _A spirit hath not
flesh and bone_, though hee shew that there be Spirits, yet hee denies not that
they are Bodies: And where St. _Paul_ saies, _We shall rise spirituall Bodies_,
he acknowledgeth the nature of Spirits, but that they are Bodily Spirits; which
is not difficult to understand. For Air and many other things are Bodies, though
not Flesh and Bone, or any other grosse body, to bee discerned by the eye. But
when our Saviour speaketh to the Devill, and commandeth him to go out of a man,
if by the Devill, be meant a Disease, as Phrenesy, or Lunacy, or a corporeal
Spirit, is not the speech improper? can Diseases heare? or can there be a
corporeall Spirit in a Body of Flesh and Bone, full already of vitall and
animall Spirits? Are there not therefore Spirits, that neither have Bodies, nor
are meer Imaginations? To the first I answer, that the addressing of our
Saviours command to the Madnesse, or Lunacy he cureth, is no more improper, then
was his rebuking of the Fever, or of the Wind, and Sea; for neither do these
hear: Or than was the command of God, to the Light, to the Firmament, to the
Sunne, and Starres, when he commanded them to bee: for they could not heare
before they had a beeing. But those speeches are not improper, because they
signife the power of Gods Word: no more therefore is it improper, to command
Madnesse, or Lunacy (under the appellation of Devils, by which they were then
commonly understood,) to depart out of a mans body. To the second, concerning
their being Incorporeall, I have not yet observed any place of Scripture, from
whence it can be gathered, that any man was ever possessed with any other
Corporeall Spirit, but that of his owne, by which his body is naturally moved.

{#6} Our Saviour, immediately after the Holy Ghost#_The Scriptures doe not teach
that Spirits are Incorporeall._# descended upon him in the form of a Dove, is
said by St. _Matthew_ (Chapt. 4. 1.) to have been _led up by the Spirit into the
Wildernesse_; and the same is recited (_Luke_ 4. 1.) in these words, _Jesus
being full of the Holy Ghost, was led in the Spirit into the Wildernesse_:
Whereby it is evident, that by _Spirit_ there, is meant the Holy Ghost. This
cannot be interpreted for a Possession: For Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are but
one and the same substance; which is no possession of one substance, or body, by
another. And whereas in the verses following, he is said _to have been taken up
by the Devill into the Holy City, and set upon a pinnacle of the Temple_, shall
we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the Devill, or carryed thither by
violence? And again, _carryed thence by the Devill into an exceeding high
mountain, who shewed him them thence all the Kingdomes of the world_: Wherein,
wee are not to beleeve he was either possessed, or forced by the Devill; nor
that any Mountaine is high enough, (according to the literall sense,) to shew
him one whole Hemisphere. What then can be the meaning of this place, other than
that he went of himself into the Wildernesse; and that this carrying of him up
and down, from the Wildernesse to the City, and from thence into a Mountain, was
a Vision? Conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of St. Luke, that hee was
led into the Wildernesse, not _by_, but _in_ the Spirit: whereas concerning His
being Taken up into the Mountaine, and unto the Pinnacle of the Temple, hee
speaketh as St. Matthew doth. Which suiteth with the nature of a Vision.

{#7} Again, where St. Luke sayes of Judas Iscariot, that _Satan entred into him,
and thereupon that he went and communed with the Chief Priests, and Captaines,
how he__might betray Christ unto them_: it may be answered, that by the Entring
of _Satan_ (that is the _Enemy_) into him, is meant, the hostile and traiterous
intention of selling his Lord and Master. For as by the Holy Ghost, is
frequently in Scripture understood, the Graces and good Inclinations given by
the Holy Ghost; so by the Entring of Satan, may bee understood the wicked
Cogitations, and Designs of the Adversaries of Christ, and his Disciples. For as
it is hard to say, that the Devill was entred into Judas, before he had any such
hostile designe; so it is impertinent to say, he was first Christs Enemy in his
heart, and that the Devill entred into him afterwards. Therefore the Entring of
Satan, and his Wicked Purpose, was one and the same thing.

{#8} But if there be no Immateriall Spirit, nor any Possession of mens bodies by
any Spirit Corporeall, it may again be asked, why our Saviour and his Apostles
did not teach the People so; and in such cleer words, as they might no more
doubt thereof. But such questions as these, are more curious, than necessary for
a Christian mans Salvation. Men may as well aske, why Christ that could have
given to all men Faith, Piety, and all manner of morall Vertues, gave it to some
onely, and not to all: and why he left the search of naturall Causes, and
Sciences, to the naturall Reason and Industry of men, and did not reveal it to
all, or any man supernaturally; and many other such questions: Of which
neverthelesse there may be alledged probable and pious reasons. For as God, when
he brought the Israelites into the Land of Promise, did not secure them therein,
by subduing all the Nations round about them; but left many of them, as thornes
in their sides, to awaken from time to time their Piety and Industry: so our
Saviour, in conducting us toward his heavenly Kingdome, did not destroy all the
difficulties of Naturall Questions; but left them to exercise our Industry, and
Reason; the Scope of his preaching, being onely to shew us this plain and direct
way to Salvation, namely, the beleef of this Article, _that he was the Christ,
the Son of the living God, sent into the world to sacrifice himselfe for our
Sins, and at his comming again, gloriously to reign over his Elect, and to save
them from their Enemice eternally_: To which, the opinion of Possession by
Spirits, or Phantasmes, are no impediment in the way; though it be to some an
occasion of going out of the way, and to follow their own Inventions. If wee
require of the Scripture an account of all questions, which may be raised to
trouble us in the performance of Gods commands; we may as well complaine of
Moses for not having set downe the time of the creation of such Spirits, as well
as of the Creation of the Earth, and Sea, and of Men, and Beasts. To conclude, I
find in Scripture that there be Angels, and Spirits, good and evill; but not
that they are Incorporeall, as are the Apparitions men see in the Dark, or in a
Dream, or Vision; which the Latines call _Spectra_, and took for _D{ae}mons_.
And I find that there are Spirits Corporeall, (though subtile and Invisible;)
but not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them; And that the
Bodies of the Saints shall be such, namely, Spirituall Bodies, as St. Paul calls
them.

{#9} Neverthelesse, the contrary Doctrine, namely, that#_The Power of Casting
out Devills, not the same it was in the Primitive Church._# there be
Incorporeall Spirits, hath hitherto so prevailed in the Church, that the use of
Exorcisme, (that is to say, of ejection of Devills by Conjuration) is thereupon
built; and (though rarely and faintly practised) is not yet totally given over.
That there were many D{ae}moniaques in the Primitive Church, and few Mad-men,
and other such singular diseases; whereas in these times we hear of, and see
many Mad-men, and few D{ae}moniaques, proceeds not from the change of Nature;
but of Names. But how it comes to passe, that whereas heretofore the Apostles,
and after them for a time, the Pastors of the Church, did cure those singular
Diseases, which now they are not seen to doe; as likewise, why it is not in the
power of every true Beleever now, to doe all that the Faithfull did then, that
is to say, as we read (_Mark_ 16. 17.) _In Christs name to cast out Devills, to
speak with new Tongues, to take up Serpents, to drink deadly Poison without harm
taking, and to cure the Sick by the laying on of their hands_, and all this
without other words, but _in the Name of Jesus_, is another question. And it is
probable, that those extraordinary gifts were given to the Church, for no longer
a time, than men trusted wholly to Christ, and looked for their felicity onely
in his Kingdome to come; and consequently, that when they sought Authority, and
Riches, and trusted to their own Subtilty for a Kingdome of this world, these
supernaturall gifts of God were again taken from them.

{#10} #_Another relique of Gentilisme, Worshipping of Images, left in the
Church, not brought into it._# Another relique of Gentilisme, is the _Worship of
Images_, neither instituted by Moses in the Old, nor by Christ in the New
Testament; nor yet brought in from the Gentiles; but left amongst them, after
they had given their names to Christ. Before our Saviour preached, it was the
generall Religion of the Gentiles, to worship for Gods, those Apparences that
remain in the Brain from the impression of externall Bodies upon the organs of
their Senses, which are commonly called _Ideas, Idols, Phantasmes, Conceits_, as
being Representations of those externall Bodies, which cause them, and have
nothing in them of reality, no more than there is in the things that seem to
stand before us in a Dream: And this is the reason why St. Paul says, _Wee know
that an Idol is Nothing_: Not that he thought that an Image of Metall, Stone, or
Wood, was nothing; but that the thing which they honored, or feared in the
Image, and held for a God, was a meer Figment, without place, habitation,
motion, or existence, but in the motions of the Brain. And the worship of these
with Divine Honour, is that which is in the Scripture called Idolatry, and
Rebellion against God. For God being King of the Jews, and his lieutenant being
first Moses, and afterward the High Priest; if the people had been permitted to
worship, and pray to Images, (which are Representations of their own Fancies,)
they had had no farther dependence on the true God, of whom their can be no
similitude; nor on his prime Ministers, Moses, and the High Priests; but every
man had governed himself according to his own appetite, to the utter eversion of
the Common-wealth, and their own destruction for want of Union. And therefore
the first Law of God was, _They should not take for Gods_, ^ALIENOS^ ^Deos^,
that is, _the Gods of other nations, but that onely true God, who vouchsafed to
commune with Moses, and by him to give them laws and directions, for their
peace, and for their salvation from their enemies_. And the second was, that
_they should not make to themselves any Image to Worship, of their own
Invention_. For it is the same deposing of a King, to submit to another King,
whether he be set up by a neighbour nation, or by our selves.

{#11} The places of Scripture pretended to countenance the#_Answer to certain
seeming texts for Images._# setting up of Images, to worship them; or to set
them up at all in the places where God is worshipped, are First, two Examples;
one of the Cherubins over the Ark of God; the other of the Brazen Serpent:
Secondly, some texts whereby we are commanded to worship certain Creatures for
their relation to God; as to worship his Footstool: And lastly, some other
texts, by which is authorized, a religious honoring of Holy things. But before I
examine the force of those places, to prove that which is pretended, I must
first explain what is to be understood by _Worshipping_, and what by _Images_,
and _Idols_.

{#12} I have already shewn in the 20 Chapter of this Discourse,#_What is
Worship._# that to Honor, is to value highly the Power of any person: and that
such value is measured, by our comparing him with others. But because there is
nothing to be compared with God in Power; we Honor him not but Dishonour him by
any Value lesse than Infinite. And thus Honor is properly of its own nature,
secret, and internall in the heart. But the inward thoughts of men, which
appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes of our Honoring,
and these goe by the name of ^Worship^, in Latine ^Cultus^. Therefore, to Pray
to, to Swear by, to Obey, to bee Diligent, and Officious in Serving: in summe,
all words and actions that betoken Fear to Offend, or Desire to Please, is
_Worship_, whether those words and actions be sincere, or feigned: and because
they appear as signes of Honoring, are ordinarily also called _Honor_.

{#13} #_Distinction between Divine and Civill Worship._# The Worship we exhibite
to those we esteem to be but men, as to Kings, and men in Authority, is _Civill
Worship_: But the worship we exhibite to that which we think to bee God,
whatsoever the words, ceremonies, gestures, or other actions be, is _Divine
Worship_. To fall prostrate before a King, in him that thinks him but a Man, is
but Civill Worship: And he that but putteth off his hat in the Church, for this
cause, that he thinketh it the House of God, worshippeth with Divine Worship.
They that seek the distinction of Divine and Civill Worship, not in the
intention of the Worshipper, but in the Words δονλεία and λατρεία deceive
themselves. For whereas there be two sorts of Servants; that sort, which is of
those that are absolutely in the power of their Masters, as Slaves taken in war,
and their Issue, whose bodies are not in their own power, (their lives depending
on the Will of their Masters, in such manner as to forfeit them upon the least
disobedience,) and that are bought and sold as Beasts, were called Δου̑λοι that
is properly, Slaves, and their Service Δονλεία: The other, which is of those
that serve (for hire, or in hope of benefit from their Masters) voluntarily; are
called Θη̑τεβ; that is, Domestique Servants; to whose service the Masters have
no further right, than is contained in the Covenants made betwixt them. These
two kinds of Servants have thus much common to them both, that their labour is
appointed them by another: And the word Λάτεις is the generall name of both,
signifying him that worketh for another, whether, as a Slave, or a voluntary
Servant: So that Λατρεία signifieth generally all Service; but Δονλεία the
service of Bondmen onely, and the condition of Slavery: And both are used in
Scripture (to signifie our Service of God) promiscuously. Δονλεία because we are
Gods Slaves; Λατρεία because wee Serve him: and in all kinds of Service is
contained, not onely Obedience, but also Worship; that is, such actions,
gestures, and words, as signifie Honor.

{#14} #_An Image what. Phantasmes._# An ^Image^ (in the most strict
signification of the word) is the Resemblance of some thing visible: In which
sense the Phantasticall Formes, Apparitions, or Seemings of visible Bodies to
the Sight, are onely _Images_; such as are the Shew of a man, or other thing in
the Water, by Reflexion, or Refraction; or of the Sun, or Stars by Direct Vision
in the Air; which are nothing reall in the things seen, nor in the place where
they seem to bee; nor are their magnitudes and figures the same with that of the
object; but changeable, by the variation of the organs of Sight, or by glasses;
and are present oftentimes in our Imagination, and in our Dreams, when the
object is absent; or changed into other colours, and shapes, as things that
depend onely upon the Fancy. And these are the Images which are originally and
most properly called _Ideas_, and ^Idols^, and derived from the language of the
Gr{ae}cians, with whom the word Ε῀δω signifieth to _See_. They are also called
^Phantasmes^, which is in the same language, _Apparitions_. And from these
Images it is that one of the faculties of mans Nature, is called the
_Imagination_. And from hence it is manifest, that there neither is, nor can bee
any Image made of a thing Invisible.

{#15} It is also evident, that there can be no Image of a thing Infinite: for
all the Images, and Phantasmes that are made by the Impression of things
visible, are figured: but Figure is a quantity every way determined: And
therefore there can bee no Image of God; nor of the Soule of Man; nor of
Spirits; but onely of Bodies Visible, that is, Bodies that have light in
themselves, or are by such enlightened.

{#16} And whereas a man can fancy Shapes he never saw;#_Fictions._# making up a
Figure out of the parts of divers creatures; as the Poets make their Centaures,
Chim{ae}ras, and other Monsters never seen: So can he also give Matter to those
Shapes, and make them in Wood, Clay or Metall. And#_Materiall Images._# these
are also called Images, not for the resemblance of any corporeall thing, but for
the resemblance of some Phantasticall Inhabitants of the Brain of the Maker. But
in these Idols, as they are originally in the Brain, and as they are painted,
carved, moulded, or moulten in matter, there is a similitude of the one to the
other, for which the Materiall Body made by Art, may be said to be the Image of
the Phantasticall Idoll made by Nature.

{#17} But in a larger use of the word Image, is contained also, any
Representation of one thing by another. So an earthly Soveraign may be called
the Image of God: And an inferiour Magistrate the Image of an earthly Soveraign.
And many times in the Idolatry of the Gentiles there was little regard to the
similitude of their Materiall Idol to the Idol in their fancy, and yet it was
called the Image of it. For a Stone unhewn has been set up for Neptune, and
divers other shapes far different from the shapes they conceived of their Gods.
And at this day we see many Images of the Virgin Mary, and other Saints, unlike
one another, and without correspondence to any one mans Fancy; and yet serve
well enough for the purpose they were erected for; which was no more but by the
Names onely, to represent the Persons mentioned in the History; to which every
man applyeth a Mentall Image of his owne making, or none at all. And thus an
Image in the largest sense, is either the Resemblance, or the Representation of
some thing Visible; or both together, as it happeneth for the most part.

{#18} But the name of Idoll is extended yet further in Scripture, to signifie
also the Sunne, or a Starre, or any other Creature, visible or invisible, when
they are worshipped for Gods.

{#19} #_Idolatry what._# Having shewn what is _Worship_, and what an _Image_; I
will now put them together, and examine what that ^Idolatry^ is, which is
forbidden in the Second Commandement, and other places of the Scripture.

{#20} To worship an Image, is voluntarily to doe those externall acts, which are
signes of honoring either the matter of the Image, which is Wood, Stone, Metall,
or some other visible creature; or the Phantasme of the brain, for the
resemblance, or representation whereof, the matter was formed and figured; or
both together, as one animate Body, composed of the Matter and the Phantasme, as
of a Body and Soule.

{#21} To be uncovered, before a man of Power and Authority, or before the Throne
of a Prince, or in such other places as hee ordaineth to that purpose in his
absence, is to Worship that man, or Prince with Civill Worship; as being a
signe, not of honoring the stoole, or place, but the Person; and is not
Idolatry. But if hee that doth it, should suppose the Soule of the Prince to be
in the Stool, or should present a Petition to the Stool, it were Divine Worship,
and Idolatry.

{#22} To pray to a King for such things, as hee is able to doe for us, though we
prostrate our selves before him, is but Civill Worship; because we acknowledge
no other power in him, but humane: But voluntarily to pray unto him for fair
weather, or for any thing which God onely can doe for us, is Divine Worship, and
Idolatry. On the other side, if a King compell a man to it by the terrour of
Death, or other great corporall punishment, it is not Idolatry: For the Worship
which the Soveraign commandeth to bee done unto himself by the terrour of his
Laws, is not a sign that he that obeyeth him, does inwardly honour him as a God,
but that he is desirous to save himselfe from death, or from a miserable life;
and that which is not a sign of internall honor, is no Worship; and therefore no
Idolatry. Neither can it bee said, that hee that does it, scandalizeth, or
layeth any stumbling block before his Brother; because how wise, or learned
soever he be that worshippeth in that manner, another man cannot from thence
argue, that he approveth it; but that he doth it for fear; and that it is not
his act, but the act of his Soveraign.

{#23} To worship God, in some peculiar Place, or turning a mans face towards an
Image, or determinate Place, is not to worship, or honor the Place, or Image;
but to acknowledge it Holy, that is to say, to acknowledge the Image, or the
Place to be set apart from common use: for that is the meaning of the word
_Holy_; which implies no new quality in the Place, or Image; but onely a new
Relation by Appropriation to God; and therefore is not Idolatry; no more than it
was Idolatry to worship God before the Brazen Serpent; or for the Jews when they
were out of their owne countrey, to turn their faces (when they prayed) toward
the Temple of Jerusalem; or for Moses to put off his Shoes when he was before
the Flaming Bush, the ground appertaining to Mount Sinai; which place God had
chosen to appear in, and to give his Laws to the People of Israel, and was
therefore Holy ground, not by inh{ae}rent sanctity, but by separation to Gods
use; or for Christians to worship in the Churches, which are once solemnly
dedicated to God for that purpose, by the Authority of the King, or other true
Representant of the Church. But to worship God, as inanimating, or inhabiting,
such Image, or place; that is to say, an infinite substance in a finite place,
is Idolatry: for such finite Gods, are but Idols of the brain, nothing reall;
and are commonly called in the Scripture by the names of _Vanity_, and _Lyes_,
and _Nothing_. Also to worship God, not as inanimating, or present in the place,
or Image; but to the end to be put in mind of him, or of some works of his, in
case the Place, or Image be dedicated, or set up by private authority, and not
by the authority of them that are our Soveraign Pastors, is Idolatry. For the
Commandement is, _Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image_. God
commanded Moses to set up the Brazen Serpent; hee did not make it to himselfe;
it was not therefore against the Commandement. But the making of the Golden
Calfe by Aaron, and the People, as being done without authority from God, was
Idolatry; not onely because they held it for God, but also because they made it
for a Religious use, without warrant either from God their Soveraign, or from
Moses, that was his Lieutenant.

{#24} The Gentiles worshipped for Gods, Jupiter, and others; that living, were
men perhaps that had done great and glorious Acts; and for the Children of God,
divers men and women, supposing them gotten between an Immortall Deity, and a
mortall man. This was Idolatry, because they made them so to themselves, having
no authority from God, neither in his eternall Law of Reason, nor in his
positive and revealed Will. But though our Saviour was a man, whom wee also
beleeve to bee God Immortall, and the Son of God; yet this is no Idolatry;
because wee build not that beleef upon our own fancy, or judgment, but upon the
Word of God revealed in the Scriptures. And for the adoration of the Eucharist,
if the words of Christ, _This is my Body_, signifie, that he himselfe, and the
seeming bread in his hand; and not onely so, but  that all the seeming morsells
of bread that have ever since been, and any time hereafter shall bee consecrated
by Priests, bee so many Christs bodies, and yet all of them but one body, then
is that no Idolatry, because it is authorized by our Saviour: but if that text
doe not signifie that, (for there is no other that can be alledged for it,)
then, because it is a worship of humane institution, it is Idolatry. For it is
not enough to say, God can transubstantiate the Bread into Christs Body: For the
Gentiles also held God to be Omnipotent; and might upon that ground no lesse
excuse their Idolatry, by pretending, as well as others, a transubstantiation of
their Wood, and Stone into God Almighty.

{#25} Whereas there be, that pretend Divine Inspiration, to be a supernaturall
entring of the Holy Ghost into a man, and not an acquisition of Gods graces, by
doctrine, and study; I think they are in a very dangerous Dilemma. For if they
worship not the men whom they beleeve to be so inspired, they fall into Impiety;
as not adoring Gods supernaturall Presence. And again, if they worship them,
they commit Idolatry; for the Apostles would never permit themselves to be so
worshipped. Therefore the safest way is to beleeve, that by the Descending of
the Dove upon the Apostles; and by Christs Breathing on them, when hee gave them
the Holy Ghost; and by the giving of it by Imposition of Hands, are understood
the signes which God hath been pleased to use, or ordain to bee used, of his
promise to assist those persons in their study to Preach his Kingdome, and in
their Conversation, that it might not be Scandalous, but Edifying to others.

{#26} Besides the Idolatrous Worship of Images, there is#_Scandalous worship of
Images._# also a Scandalous Worship of them; which is also a sin; but not
Idolatry. For _Idolatry_ is to worship by signes of an internall, and reall
honour: but _Scandalous Worship_, is but Seeming Worship; and may sometimes bee
joined with an inward, and hearty detestation, both of the Image, and of the
Phantasticall _D{ae}mon_, or Idol, to which it is dedicated; and proceed onely
from the fear of death, or other grievous punishment; and is neverthelesse a sin
in them that so worship, in case they be men whose actions are looked at by
others, as lights to guide them by; because following their ways, they cannot
but stumble, and fall in the way of Religion: Whereas the example of those we
regard not, works not on us at all, but leaves us to our own diligence and
caution; and consequently are no causes of our falling.

{#27} If therefore a Pastor lawfully called to teach and direct others, or any
other, of whose knowledge there is a great opinion, doe externall honor to an
Idol for fear; unlesse he make his feare, and unwillingnesse to it, as evident
as the worship; he Scandalizeth his Brother, by seeming to approve Idolatry. For
his Brother arguing from the action of his teacher, or of him whose knowledge he
esteemeth great, concludes it to bee lawfull in it selfe. And this Scandall, is
Sin, and a _Scandall given_. But if one being no Pastor, nor of eminent
reputation for knowledge in Christian Doctrine, doe the same, and another follow
him; this is no Scandall given; for he had no cause to follow such example: but
is a pretence of Scandall which hee taketh of himselfe for an excuse before men:
For an unlearned man, that is in the power of an Idolatrous King, or State, if
commanded on pain of death to worship before an Idoll, hee detesteth the Idoll
in his heart, hee doth well; though if he had the fortitude to suffer death,
rather than worship it, he should doe better. But if a Pastor, who as Christs
Messenger, has undertaken to teach Christs Doctrine to all nations, should doe
the same, it were not onely a sinfull Scandall, in respect of other Christian
mens consciences, but a perfidious forsaking of his charge.

{#28} The summe of that which I have said hitherto, concerning the Worship of
Images, is this, that he that worshippeth in an Image, or any Creature, either
the Matter thereof, or any Fancy of his own, which he thinketh to dwell in it;
or both together; or beleeveth that such things hear his Prayers, or see his
Devotions, without Ears, or Eyes, committeth Idolatry: and he that
counterfeiteth such Worship for fear of punishment, if he bee a man whose
example hath power amongst his Brethren, committeth a sin: But he that
worshippeth the Creator of the world before such an Image, or in such a place as
he hath not made, or chosen of himselfe, but taken from the commandement of Gods
Word, as the Jewes did in worshipping God before the Cherubins, and before the
Brazen Serpent for a time, and in, or towards the Temple of Jerusalem, which was
also but for a time, committeth not Idolatry.

{#29} Now for the Worship of Saints, and Images, and Reliques, and other things
at this day practised in the Church of Rome, I say they are not allowed by the
Word of God, nor brought into the Church of Rome, from the Doctrine there
taught; but partly left in it at the first conversion of the Gentiles; and
afterwards countenanced, and confirmed, and augmented by the Bishops of Rome.

{#30} As for the proofs alledged out of Scripture, namely,#_Answer to the
Argument from the Cherubins, and Brazen Serpent._# those examples of Images
appointed by God to bee set up; They were not set up for the people, or any man
to worship; but that they should worship God himselfe before them; as before the
Cherubins over the Ark, and the Brazen Serpent. For we read not, that the
Priest, or any other did worship the Cherubins; but contrarily wee read (2
_Kings_ 18. 4.) that Hezekiah brake in pieces the Brazen Serpent which Moses had
set up, because the People burnt incense to it. Besides, those examples are not
put for our Imitation, that we also should set up Images, under pretence of
worshipping God before them; because the words of the second Commandement, _Thou
shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image, &c_. distinguish between the
Images that God commanded to be set up, and those which wee set up to our
selves. And therefore from the Cherubins, or Brazen Serpent, to the Images of
mans devising; and from the Worship commanded by God, to the Will-Worship of
men, the argument is not good. This also is to bee considered, that as Hezekiah
brake in pieces the Brazen Serpent, because the Jews did worship it, to the end
they should doe so no more; so also Christian Soveraigns ought to break down the
Images which their Subjects have been accustomed to worship; that there be no
more occasion of such Idolatry. For at this day, the ignorant People, where
Images are worshipped, doe really beleeve there is a Divine Power in the Images;
and are told by their Pastors, that some of them have spoken; and have bled; and
that miracles have been done by them; which they apprehend as done by the Saint,
which they think either is the Image it self, or in it. The Israelites, when
they worshipped the Calfe, did think they worshipped the God that brought them
out of Egypt; and yet it was Idolatry, because they thought the Calfe either was
that God, or had him in his belly. And though some man may think it impossible
for people to be so stupid, as to think the Image to be God, or a Saint; or to
worship it in that notion; yet it is manifest in Scripture to the contrary;
where when the Golden Calfe was made, the people said, #_Exod_. 32. 2.# _These
are thy Gods O Israel;_ and where the Images of Laban are called his Gods.
#_Gen_. 31. 30.# And wee see daily by experience in all sorts of People, that
such men as study nothing but their food and ease, are content to beleeve any
absurdity, rather than to trouble themselves to examine it; holding their faith
as it were by entaile unalienable, except by an expresse and new Law.

{#31} #_Painting of Fancies no Idolatry: but abusing them to Religious Worship
is._# But they inferre from some other places, that it is lawfull to paint
Angels, and also God himselfe: as from Gods walking in the Garden; from Jacobs
seeing God at the top of the ladder; and from other Visions, and Dreams. But
Visions, and Dreams, whether naturall, or supernaturall, are but Phantasmes: and
he that painteth an Image of any of them, maketh not an Image of God, but of his
own Phantasm, which is, making of an Idol. I say not, that to draw a Picture
after a fancy, is a Sin; but when it is drawn, to hold it for a Representation
of God, is against the second Commandement; and can be of no use, but to
worship. And the same may be said of the Images of Angels, and of men dead;
unlesse as Monuments of friends, or of men worthy remembrance: For such use of
an Image, is not Worship of the Image; but a civill honoring of the Person, not
that is, but that was: But when it is done to the Image which we make of a
Saint, for no other reason, but that we think he heareth our prayers, and is
pleased with the honour wee doe him when dead, and without sense, wee attribute
to him more than humane power; and therefore it is Idolatry.

{#32} Seeing therefore there is no authority, neither in the Law of Moses, nor
in the Gospel, for the religious Worship of Images, or other Representations of
God, which men set up to themselves; or for the Worship of the Image of any
Creature in Heaven, or Earth, or under the Earth: And whereas Christian Kings,
who are living Representants of God, are not to be worshipped by their Subjects,
by any act, that signifieth a greater esteem of his power, than the nature of
mortall man is capable of; It cannot be imagined, that the Religious Worship now
in use, was brought into the Church, by misunderstanding of the Scripture. It
resteth therefore, that it was left in it, by not destroying the Images
themselves, in the conversion of the Gentiles that worshipped them.

{#33} The cause whereof, was the immoderate esteem, and#_How Idolatry was left
in the Church._# prices set upon the workmanship of them, which made the owners
(though converted, from worshipping them as they had done Religiously for
D{ae}mons) to retain them still in their houses, upon pretence of doing it in
the honor of _Christ_, of the _Virgin Mary_, and of the _Apostles_, and other
the Pastors of the Primitive Church; as being easie, by giving them new names,
to make that an Image of the _Virgin Mary_, and of her _Sonne_ our Saviour,
which before perhaps was called the Image of _Venus_, and _Cupid_; and so of a
_Jupiter_ to make a _Barnabas_, and of _Mercury_ a _Paul_, and the like. And as
worldly ambition creeping by degrees into the Pastors, drew them to an endeavour
of pleasing the new made Christians; and also to a liking of this kind of
honour, which they also might hope for after their decease, as well as those
that had already gained it: so the worshipping of the Images of Christ and his
Apostles, grew more and more Idolatrous; save that somewhat after the time of
Constantine, divers Emperors, and Bishops, and generall Councells observed, and
opposed the unlawfulnesse thereof; but too late, or too weakly.

{#34} The _Canonizing of Saints_, is another Relique of#_Canonizing of Saints._#
Gentilisme: It is neither a misunderstanding of Scripture, nor a new invention
of the Roman Church, but a custome as ancient as the Common-wealth of _Rome_ it
self. The first that ever was canonized at Rome, was _Romulus_, and that upon
the narration of _Julius Proculus_, that swore before the Senate, he spake with
him after his death, and was assured by him, he dwelt in Heaven, and was there
called _Quirinus_, and would be propitious to the State of their new City: And
thereupon the Senate gave _publique testimony_ of his Sanctity. _Julius
C{ae}sar_, and other Emperors after him, had the like _testimony_; that is, were
Canonized for Saints; for by such testimony is ^Canonization^, now defined; and
is the same with the Αποθέωσις of the Heathen.

{#35} #_The name of Pontifex._# It is also from the Roman Heathen, that the
Popes have received the name, and power of ^Pontifex^ ^Maximus^. This was the
name of him that in the ancient Common-wealth of Rome, had the Supreme Authority
under the Senate and People, of regulating all Ceremonies, and Doctrines
concerning their Religion: And when _Augustus C{ae}sar_ changed the State into a
Monarchy, he took to himselfe no more but this office, and that of Tribune of
the People, (that is to say, the Supreme Power both in State, and Religion;) and
the succeeding Emperors enjoyed the same. But when the Emperour Constantine
lived, who was the first that professed and authorized Christian Religion, it
was consonant to his profession, to cause Religion to be regulated (under his
authority) by the Bishop of Rome: Though it doe not appear they had so soon the
name of _Pontifex_; but rather, that the succeeding Bishops took it of
themselves, to countenance the power they exercised over the Bishops of the
Roman Provinces. For it is not any Priviledge of St. Peter, but the Priviledge
of the City of Rome, which the Emperors were alwaies willing to uphold, that
gave them such authority over other Bishops; as may be evidently seen by that,
that the Bishop of Constantinople, when the Emperour made that City the Seat of
the Empire, pretended to bee equall to the Bishop of Rome; though at last, not
without contention, the Pope carryed it, and became the _Pontifex Maximus_; but
in right onely of the Emperour; and not without the bounds of the Empire; nor
any where, after the Emperour had lost his power in Rome; though it were the
Pope himself that took his power from him. From whence wee may by the way
observe that there is no place for the superiority of the Pope over other
Bishops, except in the territories whereof he is himself the Civill Soveraign;
and where the Emperour having Soveraign Power Civill, hath expressely chosen the
Pope for the chief Pastor under himselfe, of his Christian Subjects.

{#36} The carrying about of Images in _Procession_; is another#_Procession of
Images._# Relique of the Religion of the Greeks, and Romans: For they also
carried their Idols from place to place, in a kind of Chariot, which was
peculiarly dedicated to that use, which the Latines called _Thensa_, and
_Vehiculum Deorum_; and the Image was placed in a frame, or Shrine, which they
called _Ferculum_: And that which they called _Pompa_, is the same that now is
named _Procession_: According whereunto, amongst the Divine Honors which were
given to _Julius C{ae}sar_ by the Senate, this was one, that in the Pompe (or
Procession) at the Circ{ae}an games, he should have _Thensam & Ferculum_, a
sacred Chariot, and a Shrine; which was as much, as to be carried up and down as
a God: Just as at this day the Popes are carried by Switzers under a Canopie.

{#37} To these Processions also belonged the bearing of burning Torches, and
Candles, before the Images of the#_Wax Candles, and Torches lighted._# Gods,
both amongst the Greeks, and Romans. For afterwards the Emperors of Rome
received the same honor; as we read of _Caligula_, that at his reception to the
Empire, he was carried from _Misenum_ to _Rome_, in the midst of a throng of
People, the wayes beset with Altars, and Beasts for Sacrifice, and burning
_Torches_: And of _Caracalla_ that was received into _Alexandria_ with Incense,
and with casting of Flowers, and δαδονχίαις that is, with Torches; for Δαδου̑χοι
were they that amongst the Greeks carried Torches lighted in the Processions of
their Gods: And in processe of time, the devout, but ignorant People, did many
times honor their Bishops with the like pompe of Wax Candles, and the Images of
our Saviour, and the Saints, constantly, in the Church it self. And thus came in
the use of Wax Candles; and was also established by some of the ancient
Councells.

{#38} The Heathens had also their _Aqua Lustralis_, that is to say, _Holy
Water_. The Church of Rome imitates them also in their _Holy Dayes_. They had
their _Bacchanalia_; and we have our _Wakes_, answering to them: They their
_Saturnalia_, and we our _Carnevalls_, and Shrove-tuesdays liberty of Servants:
They their Procession of _Priapus_; wee our fetching in, erection, and dancing
about _Maypoles_; and Dancing is one kind of Worship: They had their Procession
called _Ambarvalia_; and we our Procession about the fields in the _Rogation
week_. Nor do I think that these are all the Ceremonies that have been left in
the Church, from the first conversion of the Gentiles: but they are all that I
can for the present call to mind; and if a man would wel observe that which is
delivered in the Histories, concerning the Religious Rites of the Greeks and
Romanes, I doubt not but he might find many more of these old empty Bottles of
Gentilisme, which the Doctors of the Romane Church, either by Negligence, or
Ambition, have filled up again with the new Wine of Christianity, that will not
faile in time to break them.
