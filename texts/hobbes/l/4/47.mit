£1 CHAP. XLVII. £1
£1 _Of the_ Benefit _that proceedeth from such Darknesse, and to whom it
accreweth_. £1

{#1} _Cicero_ maketh honorable mention of one of the _Cassii_,##_He that
receiveth Benefit by a Fact, is presumed to be the Author._## a severe Judge
amongst the Romans, for a custome he had, in Criminall causes, (when the
testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient,) to ask the Accusers, _Cui bono_;
that is to say, what Profit, Honor, or other Contentment, the accused obtained,
or expected by the Fact. For amongst Pr{ae}sumptions, there is none that so
evidently declareth the Author, as doth the ^Benefit^ of the Action. By the same
rule I intend in this place to examine, who they may be, that have possessed the
People so long in this part of Christendome, with these Doctrines, contrary to
the Peaceable Societies of Mankind.

{#2} And first, to this Error, _that the present Church now_##_That the Church
Militant is the Kingdome of God, was first taught by the Church of Rome._##
_Militant on Earth, is the Kingdome of God_, (that is, the Kingdome of Glory, or
the Land of Promise; not the Kingdome of Grace, which is but a Promise of the
Land,) are annexed these worldly Benefits; First, that the Pastors, and Teachers
of the Church, are entitled thereby, as Gods Publique Ministers, to a Right of
Governing the Church; and consequently (because the Church, and Common-wealth
are the same Persons) to be Rectors, and Governours of the Common-wealth. By
this title it is, that the Pope prevailed with the subjects of all Christian
Princes, to beleeve, that to disobey him, was to disobey Christ himselfe; and in
all differences between him and other Princes, (charmed with the word _Power
Spirituall_,) to abandon their lawfull Soveraigns; which is in effect an
universall Monarchy over all Christendome. For though they were first invested
in the right of being Supreme Teachers of Christian Doctrine, by, and under
Christian Emperors, within the limits of the Romane Empire (as is acknowledged
by themselves) by the title of _Pontifex Maximus_, who was an Officer subject to
the Civill State; yet after the Empire was divided, and dissolved, it was not
hard to obtrude upon the people already subject to them, another Title, namely,
the Right of St. Peter; not onely to save entire their pretended Power; but also
to extend the same over the same Christian Provinces, though no more united in
the Empire of Rome. This Benefit of an Universall Monarchy, (considering the
desire of men to bear Rule) is a sufficient Presumption, that the Popes that
pretended to it, and for a long time enjoyed it, were the Authors of the
Doctrine, by which it was obtained; namely, that the Church now on Earth, is the
Kingdome of Christ. For that granted, it must be understood, that Christ hath
some Lieutenant amongst us, by whom we are to be told what are his
Commandements.

{#3} After that certain Churches had renounced this universall Power of the
Pope, one would expect in reason, that the Civill Soveraigns in all those
Churches, should have recovered so much of it, as (before they had unadvisedly
let it goe) was their own Right, and in their own hands. And in England it was
so in effect; saving that they, by whom the Kings administred the Government of
Religion, by maintaining their imployment to be in Gods Right, seemed to usurp,
if not a Supremacy, yet an Independency on the Civill Power: and they but seemed
to usurpe it, in as much as they acknowledged a Right in the King, to deprive
them of the Exercise of their Functions at his pleasure.

{#4} #_And maintained also by the Presbytery._# But in those places where the
Presbytery took that Office, though many other Doctrines of the Church of Rome
were forbidden to be taught; yet this Doctrine, that the Kingdome of Christ is
already come, and that it began at the Resurrection of our Saviour, was still
retained. But _cui bono?_ What Profit did they expect from it? The same which
the Popes expected: to have a Soveraign Power over the People. For what is it
for men to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places of
Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom? and with force to resist him, when he
with force endeavoureth to correct them? Or what is it, without Authority from
the Civill Soveraign, to excommunicate any person, but to take from him his
Lawfull Liberty, that is, to usurpe an unlawfull Power over their Brethren? The
Authors therefore of this Darknesse in Religion, are the Romane, and the
Presbyterian Clergy.

{#5} To this head, I referre also all those Doctrines, that#_Infallibility._#
serve them to keep the possession of this spirituall Soveraignty after it is
gotten. As first, that the _Pope in his publique capacity cannot erre_. For who
is there, that beleeving this to be true, will not readily obey him in
whatsoever he commands?

{#6} Secondly, that all other Bishops, in what Common-wealth##_Subjection of
Bishops._## soever, have not their Right, neither immediately from God, nor
mediately from their Civill Soveraigns, but from the Pope, is a Doctrine, by
which there comes to be in every Christian Common-wealth many potent men, (for
so are Bishops,) that have their dependance on the Pope, and owe obedience to
him, though he be a forraign Prince; by which means he is able, (as he hath done
many times) to raise a Civill War against the State that submits not it self to
be governed according to his pleasure and Interest.

{#7} Thirdly, the exemption of these, and of all other Priests,##_Exemptions of
the Clergy._## and of all Monkes, and Fryers, from the Power of the Civill Laws.
For by this means, there is a great part of every Common-wealth, that enjoy the
benefit of the Laws, and are protected by the Power of the Civill State, which
neverthelesse pay no part of the Publique expence; nor are lyable to the
penalties, as other Subjects, due to their crimes; and consequently, stand not
in fear of any man, but the Pope; and adhere to him onely, to uphold his
universall Monarchy.

{#8} Fourthly, the giving to their Priests (which is no more##_The names of
Sacerdotes and Sacrifices._## in the New Testament but Presbyters, that is,
Elders) the name of _Sacerdotes_, | that is, Sacrificers, which was the title of
the Civill Soveraign, and his publique Ministers, amongst the Jews, whilest God
was their King. Also, the making the Lords Supper a Sacrifice, serveth to make
the People beleeve the Pope hath the same power over all Christians, that Moses
and Aaron had over the Jews; that is to say, all Power, both Civill and
Ecclesiasticall, as the High Priest then had.

{#9} #_The Sacramentation of Marriage._# Fiftly, the teaching that Matrimony
is a Sacrament, giveth to the Clergy the Judging of the lawfulnesse of
Marriages; and thereby, of what Children are Legitimate; and consequently, of
the Right of Succession to h{ae}reditary Kingdomes.

{#10} #_The single life of Priests._# Sixtly, the Deniall of Marriage to
Priests, serveth to assure this Power of the Pope over Kings. For if a King be a
Priest, he cannot Marry, and transmit his Kingdome to his Posterity; If he be
not a Priest, then the Pope pretendeth this Authority Ecclesiasticall over him,
and over his people.

{#11} #_Auricular Confession._# Seventhly, from Auricular Confession, they
obtain, for the assurance of their Power, better intelligence of the designs of
Princes, and great persons in the Civill State, than these can have of the
designs of the State Ecclesiasticall.

{#12} #_Canonization of Saints, and declaring of Martyrs._# Eighthly, by the
Canonization of Saints, and declaring who are Martyrs, they assure their Power,
in that they induce simple men into an obstinacy against the Laws and Commands
of their Civill Soveraigns even to death, if by the Popes excommunication, they
be declared Heretiques or Enemies to the Church; that is, (as they interpret
it,) to the Pope.

{#13} #_Transubstantiation, Pennance, Absolution._# Ninthly, they assure the
same, by the Power they ascribe to every Priest, of making Christ; and by the
Power of ordaining Pennance; and of Remitting, and Retaining of sins.

{#14} #_Purgatory, Indulgences, Externall works._# Tenthly, by the Doctrine of
Purgatory, of Justification by externall works, and of Indulgences, the Clergy
is enriched.

{#15} Eleventhly, by their D{ae}monology, and the use of Exorcisme, and other
things appertaining thereto, they keep (or thinke they keep) the People more in
awe of their Power#_D{ae}monology and Exorcism._#.

{#16} Lastly, the Metaphysiques, Ethiques, and Politiques of Aristotle, the
frivolous Distinctions, barbarous#_School-Divinity._# Terms, and obscure
Language of the Schoolmen, taught in the Universities, (which have been all
erected and regulated by the Popes Authority,) serve them to keep these Errors
from being detected, and to make men mistake the _Ignis fatuus_ of Vain
Philosophy, for the Light of the Gospell.

{#17} To these, if they sufficed not, might be added other##_The Authors of
spirituall Darknesse, who they be._## of their dark Doctrines, the profit
whereof redoundeth manifestly, to the setting up of an unlawfull Power over the
lawfull Soveraigns of Christian People; or for the sustaining of the same, when
it is set up; or to the worldly Riches, Honour, and Authority of those that
sustain it. And therefore by the aforesaid rule, of _Cui bono_, we may justly
pronounce for the Authors of all this Spirituall Darknesse, the Pope, and Roman
Clergy, and all those besides that endeavour to settle in the mindes of men this
erroneous Doctrine, that the Church now on Earth, is that Kingdome of God
mentioned in the Old and New Testament.

{#18} But the Emperours, and other Christian Soveraigns, under whose Government
these Errours, and the like encroachments of Ecclesiastiques upon their Office,
at first crept in, to the disturbance of their possessions, and of the
tranquillity of their Subjects, though they suffered the same for want of
foresight of the Sequel, and of insight into the designs of their Teachers, may
neverthelesse bee esteemed accessaries to their own, and the Publique dammage:
For without their Authority there could at first no seditious Doctrine have been
publiquely preached. I say they might have hindred the same in the beginning:
But when the people were once possessed by those spirituall men, there was no
humane remedy to be applyed, that any man could invent: And for the remedies
that God should provide, who never faileth in his good time to destroy all the
Machinations of men against the Truth, wee are to attend his good pleasure, that
suffereth many times the prosperity of his enemies, together with their
ambition, to grow to such a height, as the violence thereof openeth the eyes,
which the warinesse of their predecessours had before sealed up, and makes men
by too much grasping let goe all, as Peters net was broken, by the struggling of
too great a multitude of Fishes; whereas the Impatience of those, that strive to
resist such encroachment, before their Subjects eyes were opened, did but
encrease the power they resisted. I doe not therefore blame the Emperour
Frederick for holding the stirrop to our countryman Pope Adrian; for such was
the disposition of his subjects then, as if hee had not done it, hee was not
likely to have succeeded in the Empire: But I blame those, that in the
beginning, when their power was entire, by suffering such Doctrines to be forged
in the Universities of their own Dominions, have holden the Stirrop to all the
succeeding Popes, whilest they mounted into the Thrones of all Christian
Soveraigns, to ride, and tire, both them, and their people, at their pleasure.

{#19} But as the Inventions of men are woven, so also are they ravelled out; the
way is the same, but the order is inverted: The web begins at the first Elements
of Power, which are Wisdom, Humility, Sincerity, and other vertues of the
Apostles, whom the people converted, obeyed, out of Reverence, not by
Obligation: Their Consciences were free, and their Words and Actions subject to
none but the Civill Power. Afterwards the Presbyters (as the Flocks of Christ
encreased) assembling to consider what they should teach, and thereby obliging
themselves to teach nothing against the Decrees of their Assemblies, made it to
be thought the people were thereby obliged to follow their Doctrine, and when
they refused, refused to keep them company, (that was then called
Excommunication,) not as being Infidels, but as being disobedient: And this was
the first knot upon their Liberty. And the number of Presbyters encreasing, the
Presbyters of the chief City or Province, got themselves an authority over the
Parochiall Presbyters, and appropriated to themselves the names of Bishops: And
this was a second knot on Christian Liberty. Lastly, the Bishop of Rome, in
regard of the Imperiall City, took upon him an Authority (partly by the wills of
the Emperours themselves, and by the title of _Pontifex Maximus_, and at last
when the Emperours were grown weak, by the priviledges of St. Peter) over all
other Bishops of the Empire: Which was the third and last knot, and the whole
_Synthesis_ and _Construction_ of the Pontificiall Power.

{#20} And therefore the _Analysis_, or _Resolution_ is by the same way; but
beginneth with the knot that was last tyed; as wee may see in the dissolution of
the pr{ae}ter-politicall Church Government in England. First, the Power of the
Popes was dissolved totally by Queen Elizabeth; and the Bishops, who before
exercised their Functions in Right of the Pope, did afterwards exercise the same
in Right of the Queen and her Successours; though by retaining the phrase of
_Jure Divino_, they were thought to demand it by immediate Right from God: And
so was untyed the first knot. After this, the Presbyterians lately in England
obtained the putting down of Episcopacy: And so was the second knot dissolved:
And almost at the same time, the Power was taken also from the Presbyterians:
And so we are reduced to the Independency of the Primitive Christians to follow
Paul, or Cephas, or Apollos, every man as he liketh best: Which, if it be
without contention, and without measuring the Doctrine of Christ, by our
affection to the Person of his Minister, (the fault which the Apostle
reprehended in the Corinthians,) is perhaps the best: First, because there ought
to be no Power over the Consciences of men, but of the Word it selfe, working
Faith in every one, not alwayes according to the purpose of them that Plant and
Water, but of God himself, that giveth the Increase: and secondly, because it is
unreasonable in them, who teach there is such danger in every little Errour, to
require of a man endued with Reason of his own, to follow the Reason of any
other man, or of the most voices of many other men; Which is little better, then
to venture his Salvation at crosse and pile. Nor ought those Teachers to be
displeased with this losse of their antient Authority: For there is none should
know better then they, that power is preserved by the same Vertues by which it
is acquired; that is to say, by Wisdome, Humility, Clearnesse of Doctrine, and
sincerity of Conversation; and not by suppression of the Naturall Sciences, and
of the Morality of Naturall Reason; nor by obscure Language; nor by Arrogating
to themselves more Knowledge than they make appear; nor by Pious Frauds; nor by
such other faults, as in the Pastors of Gods Church are not only Faults, but
also scandalls, apt to make men stumble one time or other upon the suppression
of their Authority.

{#21} #_Comparison of the Papacy with the Kingdome of Fayries_# But after this
Doctrine, _that the Church now Militant, is the Kingdome of God spoken of in the
Old and New Testament_, was received in the World; the ambition, and canvasing
for the Offices that belong thereunto, and especially for that great Office of
being | Christs Lieutenant, and the Pompe of them that obtained therein the
principall Publique Charges, became by degrees so evident, that they lost the
inward Reverence due to the Pastorall Function: in so much as the Wisest men, of
them that had any power in the Civill State, needed nothing but the authority of
their Princes, to deny them any further Obedience. For, from the time that the
Bishop of Rome had gotten to be acknowledged for Bishop Universall, by pretence
of Succession to St. Peter, their whole Hierarchy, or Kingdome of Darknesse, may
be compared not unfitly to the _Kingdome of Fairies_; that is, to the old wives
_Fables_ in England, concerning _Ghosts_ and _Spirits_, and the feats they play
in the night. And if a man consider the originall of this great Ecclesiasticall
Dominion, he will easily perceive, that the _Papacy_, is no other, than the
_Ghost_ of the deceased _Romane Empire_, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof:
For so did the Papacy start up on a Sudden out of the Ruines of that Heathen
Power.

{#22} The _Language_ also, which they use, both in the Churches, and in their
Publique Acts, being _Latine_, which is not commonly used by any Nation now in
the world, what is it but the _Ghost_ of the Old _Romane Language_?

{#23} The _Fairies_ in what Nation soever they converse, have but one Universall
King, which some Poets of ours call King _Oberon_; but the Scripture calls
_Beelzebub_, Prince of _D{oe}mons_. The _Eoclesiastiques_ likewise, in whose
Dominions soever they be found, acknowledge but one Universall King, the _Pope_.

{#24} The _Ecclesiastiques_ are _Spirituall_ men, and _Ghostly_ Fathers. The
Fairies are _Spirits_, and _Ghosts_. _Fairies_ and _Ghosts_ inhabite Darknesse,
Solitudes, and Graves. The _Ecclesiastiques_ walke in Obscurity of Doctrine, in
Monasteries, Churches, and Church-yards.

{#25} The _Ecclesiastiques_ have their Cathedrall Churches: which, in what Towne
soever they be erected, by vertue of Holy Water, and certain Charmes called
Exorcismes, have the power to make those Townes, Cities, that is to say, Seats
of Empire. The _Fairies_ also have their enchanted Castles, and certain
Gigantique Ghosts, that domineer over the Regions round about them.

{#26} The _Fairies_ are not to be seized on; and brought to answer for the hurt
they do. So also the _Ecclesiastiques_ vanish away from the Tribunals of Civill
Justice.

{#27} The _Ecclesiastiques_ take from young men, the use of Reason, by certain
Charms compounded of Metaphysiques, and Miracles, and Traditions, and Abused
Scripture, whereby they are good for nothing else, but to execute what they
command them. The _Fairies_ likewise are said to take young Children out of
their Cradles, and to change them into Naturall Fools, which Common people do
therefore call _Elves_, and are apt to mischief.

{#28} In what Shop, or Operatory the Fairies make their Enchantment, the old
Wives have not determined. But the Operatories of the _Clergy_, are well enough
known to be the Universities, that received their Discipline from Authority
Pontificiall.

{#29} When the _Fairies_ are displeased with any body, they are said to send
their Elves, to pinch them. The _Ecclesiastiques_, when they are displeased with
any Civill State, make also their Elves, that is, Superstitious, Enchanted
Subjects, to pinch their Princes, by preaching Sedition; or one Prince enchanted
with promises, to pinch another.

{#30} The _Fairies_ marry not; but there be amongst them _Incubi_, that have
copulation with flesh and bloud. The _Priests_ also marry not.

{#31} The _Ecclesiastiques_ take the Cream of the Land, by Donations of ignorant
men, that stand in aw of them, and by Tythes: So also it is in the Fable of
_Fairies_, that they enter into the Dairies, and Feast upon the Cream, which
they skim from the Milk.

{#32} What kind of Money is currant in the Kingdome of _Fairies_, is not
recorded in the Story. But the _Ecclesiastiques_ in their Receipts accept of the
same Money that we doe; though when they are to make any Payment, it is in
Canonizations, Indulgences, and Masses.

{#33} To this, and such like resemblances between the _Papacy_, and the Kingdome
of _Fairies_, may be added this, that as the _Fairies_ have no existence, but in
the Fancies of ignorant people, rising from the Traditions of old Wives, or old
Poets: so the Spirituall Power of the _Pope_ (without the bounds of his own
Civill Dominion) consisteth onely in the Fear that Seduced people stand in, of
their Excommunications; upon hearing of false Miracles, false Traditions, and
false Interpretations of the Scripture.

{#34} It was not therefore a very difficult matter, for Henry 8. by his
Exorcisme; nor for Qu. Elizabeth by hers, to cast them out. But who knows that
this Spirit of Rome, now gone out, and walking by Missions through the dry
places of China, Japan, and the Indies, that yeeld him little fruit, may not
return, or rather an Assembly of Spirits worse than he, enter, and inhabite this
clean swept house, and make the End thereof worse than the Beginning? For it is
not the Romane Clergy onely, that pretends the Kingdome of God to be of this
World, and thereby to have a Power therein, distinct from that of the Civil
State. And this is all I had a designe to say, concerning the Doctrine of the
POLITIQUES. Which when I have reviewed, I shall willingly expose it to the
censure of my Countrey.
