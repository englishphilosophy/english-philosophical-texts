£1 _THE INTRODUCTION_. £1

{#1} ^Nature^ (the Art whereby God hath made and governes the World) is by the
_Art_ of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it can
make an Artificial Animal. For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the
begining whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not say, that all
_Automata_ (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch)
have an artificiall life? For what is the _Heart_, but a _Spring_; and the
_Nerves_, but so many _Strings_; and the _Joynts_, but so many _Wheeles_, giving
motion to the whole Body, such as was intended by the Artificer? _Art_ goes yet
further, imitating that Rationall and most excellent worke of Nature, _Man_. For
by Art is created that great ^Leviathan^ called a ^Common-wealth^, or ^State^,
(in latine ^Civitas^) which is but an Artificiall Man; though of greater stature
and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and defence it was
intended; and in which, the _Soveraignty_ is an Artificiall _Soul_, as giving
life and motion to the whole body; The _Magistrates_, and other _Officers_ of
Judicature and Execution, artificiall _Joynts_; _Reward_ and _Punishment_ (by
which fastned to the seate of the Soveraignty, every joynt and member is moved
to performe his duty) are the _Nerves_, that do the same in the Body Naturall;
The _Wealth_ and _Riches_ of all the particular members, are the _Strength_;
_Salus Populi_ (the _peoples safety_) its _Businesse_; _Counsellors_, by whom
all things needfull for it to know, are suggested unto it, are the _Memory_;
_Equity_ and _Lawes_, an artificiall _Reason_ and _Will_; _Concord, Health;
Sedition, Sicknesse_; and _Civill war, Death_. Lastly, the _Pacts_ and
_Covenants_, by which the parts of this Body Politique were at first made, set
together, and united, resemble that _Fiat_, or the _Let us make man_, pronounced
by God in the Creation.

{#2} To describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider //
~~~~First, the _Matter_ thereof, and the _Artificer_; both which is _Man_. //
~~~~Secondly, _How_, and by what _Covenants_ it is made; what are the _Rights_
and just _Power_ or _Authority_ of a _Soveraigne_; and what it is that
_preserveth_ and _dissolveth_ it. //
~~~~Thirdly, what is a _Christian Common-wealth_. //
~~~~Lastly, what is the _Kingdome of Darkness_.

{#3} Concerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late, That
_Wisedome_ is acquired, not by reading of _Books_, but of _Men_. Consequently
whereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof of
being wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read in men, by
uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs. But there is another
saying not of late understood, by which they might learn truly to read one
another, if they would take the pains; and that is, _Nosce teipsum, Read thy
self_: which was not meant, as it is now used, to countenance, either the
barbarous state of men in power, towards their inferiors; or to encourage men of
low degree, to a sawcie behaviour towards their betters; But to teach us, that
for the similitude of the thoughts, and Passions of one man, to the thoughts,
and Passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself, and considereth what he
doth, when he does _think, opine, reason, hope, feare_, &c, and upon what
grounds; he shall thereby read and know, what are the thoughts, and Passions of
all other men, upon the like occasions. I say the similitude of _Passions_,
which are the same in all men, _desire, feare, hope_, &c; not the similitude of
the _objects_ of the Passions, which are the things _desired, feared, hoped_,
&c: for these the constitution individuall, and particular education do so vary,
and they are so easie to be kept from our knowledge, that the characters of mans
heart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying,
counter-feiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that
searcheth hearts. And though by mens actions wee do discover their designe
sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own, and distinguishing
all circumstances, by which the case may come to be altered, is to decypher
without a key, and be for the most part deceived, by too much trust, or by too
much diffidence; as he that reads, is himself a good or evil man.

{#4} But let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it serves
him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. He that is to govern a whole
Nation, must read in himself, not this, or that particular man; but Man-kind:
which though it be hard to do, harder than to learn any Language, or Science;
yet, when I shall have set down my own reading orderly, and perspicuously, the
pains left another, will be onely to consider, if he also find not the same in
himself. For this kind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration.
