£1 CHAP. XXXI. £1
£1 _Of the ^Kingdome of God by Nature^._ £1

{#1} #_The scope of the following Chapters._# ^That^ the condition of meer
Nature, that is to say, of absolute Liberty, such as is theirs, that neither are
Soveraigns, nor Subjects, is Anarchy, and the condition of Warre: That the
Pr{ae}cepts, by which men are guided to avoyd that condition, are the Lawes of
Nature: That a Common-wealth, without Soveraign Power, is but a word, without
substance, and cannot stand: That Subjects owe to Soveraigns, simple Obedience,
in all things, wherein their obedience is not repugnant to the Lawes of God, I
have sufficiently proved, in that which I have already written. There wants
onely, for the entire knowledge of Civill duty, to know what are those Lawes of
God. For without that, a man knows not, when he is commanded any thing by the
Civill Power, whether it be contrary to the Law of God, or not: and so, either
by too much civill obedience, offends the Divine Majesty, or through feare of
offending God, transgresses the commandements of the Common-wealth. To avoyd
both these Rocks, it is necessary to know what are the Lawes Divine. And seeing
the knowledge of all Law, dependeth on the knowledge of the Soveraign Power; I
shall say something in that which followeth, of the ^Kingdome of^ ^God^.

{#2} #_Psal. 96.1._# _God is King, let the Earth rejoyce_, saith the
Psalmist.#_Psal. 98.1._# nd again, _God is King though the Nations be angry; and
he that sitteth on the Cherubins, though the earth be moved_.#_Who are subjects
in the kingdome of God._# hether men will or not, they must be subject alwayes
to the Divine Power. By denying the Existence, or Providence of God, men may
shake off their Ease, but not their Yoke. But to call this Power of God, which
extendeth it selfe not onely to Man, but also to Beasts, and Plants, and Bodies
inanimate, by the name of Kingdome, is but a metaphoricall use of the word. For
he onely is properly said to Raigne, that governs his Subjects, by his Word, and
by promise of Rewards to those that obey it, and by threatning them with
Punishment that obey it not. Subjects therefore in the Kingdome of God, are not
Bodies Inanimate, nor creatures Irrationall; because they understand no Precepts
as his: Nor Atheists; nor they that believe not that God has any care of the
actions of mankind; because they acknowledge no Word for his, nor have hope of
his rewards, or fear of his threatnings. They therefore that believe there is a
God that governeth the world, and hath given Pr{ae}cepts, and propounded
Rewards, and Punishments to Mankind, are Gods Subjects; all the rest, are to be
understood as Enemies.

{#3} To rule by Words, requires that such Words be manifestly#_A Three-fold Word
of God, Reason, Revelation, Prophecy._# made known; for else they are no Lawes:
For to the nature of Lawes belongeth a sufficient, and clear Promulgation, such
as may take away the excuse of Ignorance; which in the Lawes of men is but of
one onely kind, and that is, Proclamation, or Promulgation by the voyce of man.
But God declareth his Lawes three wayes; by the Dictates of _Naturall Reason_,
by _Revelation_, and by the _Voyce_ of some _man_, to whom by the operation of
Miracles, he procureth credit with the rest. From hence there ariseth a triple
Word of God, _Rational, Sensible_, and _Prophetique:_ to which Correspondeth a
triple Hearing; _Right Reason, Sense Supernaturall_, and _Faith_. As for Sense
Supernaturall, which consisteth in Revelation, or Inspiration, there have not
been any Universall Lawes so given, because God speaketh not in that manner, but
to particular persons, and to divers men divers things.

{#4} From the difference between the other two kinds of#_A twofold Kingdome of
God, Naturall and Prophetique._# Gods Word, _Rationall_, and _Prophetique_,
there may be attributed to God, a two-fold Kingdome, Naturall, and
_Prophetique:_ Naturall, wherein he governeth as many of Mankind as acknowledge
his Providence, by the naturall Dictates of Right Reason; And Prophetique,
wherein having chosen out one peculiar Nation (the Jewes) for his Subjects, he
governed them, and none but them, not onely by naturall Reason, but by Positive
Lawes, which he gave them by the mouths of his holy Prophets. Of the Naturall
Kingdome of God I intend to speak in this Chapter.

{#5} #_The Right of Gods Soveraignty is derived from his Omnipotence._# The
Right of Nature, whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break
his Lawes, is to be derived, not from his Creating them, as if he required
obedience, as of Gratitude for his benefits; but from his _Irresistible Power_.
I have formerly shewn, how the Soveraign Right ariseth from Pact: To shew how
the same Right may arise from Nature, requires no more, but to shew in what case
it is never taken away. Seeing all men by Nature had Right to All things, they
had Right every one to reigne over all the rest. But because this Right could
not be obtained by force, it concerned the safety of every one, laying by that
Right, to set up men (with Soveraign Authority) by common consent, to rule and
defend them: whereas if there had been any man of Power Irresistible; there had
been no reason, why he should not by that Power have ruled, and defended both
himselfe, and them, according to his own discretion. To those therefore whose
Power is irresistible, the dominion of all men adh{ae}reth naturally by their
excellence of Power; and consequently it is from that Power, that the Kingdome
over men, and the Right of afflicting men at his pleasure, belongeth Naturally
to God Almighty; not as Creator, and Gracious; but as Omnipotent. And though
Punishment be due for Sinne onely, because by that word is understood Affliction
for Sinne; yet the Right of Afflicting, is not alwayes derived from mens Sinne,
but from Gods Power.

{#6} #_Sinne not the cause of all Affliction._# This question, _Why Evill men
often Prosper, and Good men suffer Adversity_, has been much disputed by the
Antient, and is the same with this of ours, _by what Right God dispenseth the
Prosperities and Adversities of this life_; and is of that difficulty, as it
hath shaken the faith, not onely of the Vulgar, but of Philosophers, and which
is more, of the Saints, concerning the Divine Providence.#_Psal. 72. ver.
1,2,3._#_How Good_ (saith _David_) _is the God of Israel to those that are
Upright in Heart; and yet my feet were almost gone, my treadings had well-nigh
slipt; for I was grieved at the Wicked, when I saw the Ungodly in such
Prosperity_. And _Job_, how earnestly does he expostulate with God, for the many
Afflictions he suffered, notwithstanding his Righteousnesse? This question in
the case of _Job_, is decided by God himselfe, not by arguments derived from
_Job's_ Sinne, but his own Power. For whereas the friends of _Job_ drew their
arguments from his Affliction to his Sinne, and he defended himselfe by the
conscience of his Innocence, God himselfe taketh up the matter, and having
justified the Affliction by arguments drawn from his Power, such as this, _Where
wast thou when I layd the_#_Job 38. v. 4._# _foundations of the earth_, and the
like, both approved _Job's_ Innocence, and reproved the Erroneous doctrine of
his friends. Conformable to this doctrine is the sentence of our Saviour,
concerning the man that was born Blind, in these words, _Neither hath this man
sinned, nor his fathers; but that the works of God might be made manifest in
him_. And though it be said, _That Death entred into the world by sinne_, (by
which is meant that if _Adam_ had never sinned, he had never dyed, that is,
never suffered any separation of his soule from his body,) it follows not
thence, that God could not justly have Afflicted him, though he had not Sinned,
as well as he afflicteth other living creatures, that cannot sinne.

{#7} Having spoken of the Right of Gods Soveraignty, as#_Divine Lawes._#
grounded onely on Nature; we are to consider next, what are the Divine Lawes, or
Dictates of Naturall Reason; which Lawes concern either the naturall Duties of
one man to another, or the Honour naturally due to our Divine Soveraign. The
first are the same Lawes of Nature, of which I have spoken already in the 14.
and 15. Chapters of this Treatise; namely, Equity, Justice, Mercy, Humility, and
the rest of the Morall Vertues. It remaineth therefore that we consider, what
Pr{ae}cepts are dictated to men, by their Naturall Reason onely, without other
word of God, touching the Honour and Worship of the Divine Majesty.

{#8} Honour consisteth in the inward thought, and opinion#_Honour and Worship
what._# of the Power, and Goodnesse of another: and therefore to Honour God, is
to think as Highly of his Power and Goodnesse, as is possible. And of that
opinion, the externall signes appearing in the Words, and Actions of men, are
called _Worship_; which is one part of that which the Latines understand by the
word _Cultus_: For _Cultus_ signifieth properly, and constantly, that labour
which a man bestowes on any thing, with a purpose to make benefit by it. Now
those things whereof we make benefit, are either subject to us, and the profit
they yeeld, followeth the labour we bestow upon them, as a naturall effect; or
they are not subject to us, but answer our labour, according to their own Wills.
In the first sense the labour bestowed on the Earth, is called _Culture_; and
the education of Children a _Culture_ of their mindes. In the second sense,
where mens wills are to be wrought to our purpose, not by Force, but by
Compleasance, it signifieth as much as Courting, that is, a winning of favour by
good offices; as by praises, by acknowledging their Power, and by whatsoever is
pleasing to them from whom we look for any benefit. And this is properly
_Worship_: in which sense _Publicola_, is understood for a Worshipper of the
People; and _Cultus Dei_, for the Worship of God.

{#9} #_Severall signes of Honour._# From internall Honour, consisting in the
opinion of Power and Goodnesse, arise three Passions; _Love_, which hath
reference to Goodnesse; and _Hope_, and _Fear_, that relate to Power: And three
parts of externall worship; _Praise, Magnifying_, and _Blessing_: The subject of
Praise, being Goodnesse; the subject of Magnifying, and Blessing, being Power,
and the effect thereof Felicity. Praise, and Magnifying are signified both by
Words, and Actions: By Words, when we say a man is Good, or Great: By Actions,
when we thank him for his Bounty, and obey his Power. The opinion of the
Happinesse of another, can onely be expressed by words.

{#10} #_Worship Naturall and Arbitrary._# There be some signes of Honour, (both
in Attributes and Actions,) that be Naturally so; as amongst Attributes, _Good,
Just, Liberall_, and the like; and amongst Actions, _Prayers, Thanks_, and
_Obedience_. Others are so by Institution, or Custome of men; and in some times
and places are Honourable; in others Dishonourable; in others Indifferent: such
as are the Gestures in Salutation, Prayer, and Thanksgiving, in different times
and places, differently used. The former is _Naturall_; the later _Arbitrary_
Worship.

{#11} And of Arbitrary Worship, there bee two differences:#_Worship Commanded
and Free._# For sometimes it is a _Commanded_, sometimes _Voluntary_ Worship:
Commanded, when it is such as hee requireth, who is Worshipped: Free, when it is
such as the Worshipper thinks fit. When it is Commanded, not the words, or
gesture, but the obedience is the Worship. But when Free, the Worship consists
in the opinion of the beholders: for if to them the words, or actions by which
we intend honour, seem ridiculous, and tending to contumely; they are no
Worship; because no signes of Honour; and no signes of Honour; because a signe
is not a signe to him that giveth it, but to him to whom it is made; that is, to
the spectator.

{#12} Again, there is a _Publique_, and a _Private_ Worship.#_Worship Publique
and Private._# Publique, is the Worship that a Common-wealth performeth, as one
Person. Private, is that which a Private person exhibiteth. Publique, in respect
of the whole Common-wealth, is Free; but in respect of Particular men it is not
so. Private, is in secret Free; but in the sight of the multitude, it is never
without some Restraint, either from the Lawes, or from the Opinion of men; which
is contrary to the nature of Liberty.

{#13} The End of Worship amongst men, is Power. For#_The end of Worship._# where
a man seeth another worshipped, he supposeth him powerfull, and is the readier
to obey him; which makes his Power greater. But God has no Ends: the worship we
do him, proceeds from our duty, and is directed according to our capacity, by
those rules of Honour, that Reason dictateth to be done by the weak to the more
potent men, in hope of benefit, for fear of dammage, or in thankfulnesse for
good already received from them.

{#14} That we may know what worship of God is taught us#_Attributes of Divine
Honour._# by the light of Nature, I will begin with his Attributes. Where,
First, it is manifest, we ought to attribute to him _Existence_: For no man can
have the will to honour that, which he thinks not to have any Beeing.

{#15} Secondly, that those Philosophers, who sayd the World, or the Soule of the
World was God, spake unworthily of him; and denyed his Existence: For by God, is
understood the cause of the World; and to say the World is God, is to say there
is no cause of it, that is, no God.

{#16} Thirdly, to say the World was not Created, but Eternall, (seeing that
which is Eternall has no cause,) is to deny there is a God.

{#17} Fourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) Ease to God, take from
him the care of Man-kind; take from him his Honour: for it takes away mens love,
and fear of him; which is the root of Honour.

{#18} Fifthly, in those things that signifie Greatnesse, and Power; to say he is
_Finite_, is not to Honour him: For it is not a signe of the Will to Honour God,
to attribute to him lesse than we can; and Finite, is lesse than we can; because
to Finite, it is easie to adde more.

{#19} Therefore to attribute _Figure_ to him, is not Honour; for all Figure is
Finite:

{#20} Nor to say we conceive, and imagine, or have an _Idea_ of him, in our
mind: for whatsoever we conceive is Finite:

{#21} Nor to attribute to him _Parts_, or _Totality_; which are the Attributes
onely of things Finite:

{#22} Nor to say he is in this, or that _Place_: for whatsoever is in Place, is
bounded, and Finite:

{#23} Nor that he is _Moved_, or _Resteth_: for both these Attributes ascribe to
him Place:

{#24} Nor that there be more Gods than one; because it implies them all Finite:
for there cannot be more than one Infinite:

{#25} Nor to ascribe to him (unlesse Metaphorically, meaning not the Passion,
but the Effect) Passions that partake of Griefe; as _Repentance, Anger, Mercy_:
or of Want; as _Appetite, Hope, Desire_; or of any Passive faculty: For Passion,
is Power limited by somewhat else.

{#26} And therefore when we ascribe to God a _Will_, it is not to be understood,
as that of Man, for a _Rationall Appetite_; but as the Power, by which he
effecteth every thing.

{#27} Likewise when we attribute to him _Sight_, and other acts of Sense; as
also _Knowledge_, and _Understanding_; which in us is nothing else, but a tumult
of the mind, raised by externall things that presse the organicall parts of mans
body: For there is no such thing in God; and being things that depend on
naturall causes, cannot be attributed to him.

{#28} Hee that will attribute to God, nothing but what is warranted by naturall
Reason, must either use such Negative Attributes, as _Infinite, Eternall,
Incompre-hensible_; or Superlatives, as _Most High, most Great_, and the like;
or Indefinite, as _Good, Just, Holy, Creator_; and in such sense, as if he meant
not to declare what he is, (for that were to circumscribe him within the limits
of our Fancy,) but how much wee admire him, and how ready we would be to obey
him; which is a signe of Humility, and of a Will to honour him as much as we
can: For there is but one Name to signifie our Conception of his Nature, and
that is, I ^AM^: and but one Name of his Relation to us, and that is _God_; in
which is contained Father, King, and Lord.

{#29} Concerning the actions of Divine Worship, it is a most#_Actions that are
signes of Divine Honour._# generall Precept of Reason, that they be signes of
the Intention to Honour God; such as are, First, _Prayers_: For not the Carvers,
when they made Images, were thought to make them Gods; but the People that
_Prayed_ to them.

{#30} Secondly, _Thanksgiving_; which differeth from Prayer in Divine Worship,
no otherwise, than that Prayers precede, and Thanks succeed the benefit; the end
both of the one, and the other, being to acknowledge God, for Author of all
benefits, as well past, as future.

{#31} Thirdly, _Gifts_; that is to say, _Sacrifices_, and _Oblations_, (if they
be of the best,) are signes of Honour: for they are Thanksgivings.

{#32} Fourthly, _Not to swear by any but God_, is naturally a signe of Honour:
for it is a confession that God onely knoweth the heart; and that no mans wit,
or strength can protect a man against Gods vengeance on the perjured.

{#33} Fifthly, it is a part of Rationall Worship, to speak Considerately of God;
for it argues a Fear of him, and Fear, is a confession of his Power. Hence
followeth, That the name of God is not to be used rashly, and to no purpose; for
that is as much, as in Vain: And it is to no purpose unlesse it be by way of
Oath, and by order of the Common-wealth, to make Judgements certain; or between
Common-wealths, to avoyd Warre. And that disputing of Gods nature is contrary to
his Honour: For it is supposed, that in this naturall Kingdome of God, there is
no other way to know any thing, but by naturall Reason; that is, from the
Principles of naturall Science; which are so farre from teaching us any thing of
Gods nature, as they cannot teach us our own nature, nor the nature of the
smallest creature living. And therefore, when men out of the Principles of
naturall Reason, dispute of the Attributes of God, they but dishonour him: For
in the Attributes which we give to God, we are not to consider the signification
of Philosophicall Truth; but the signification of Pious Intention, to do him the
greatest Honour we are able. From the want of which consideration, have
proceeded the volumes of disputation about the nature of God, that tend not to
his Honour, but to the honour of our own wits, and learning; and are nothing
else but inconsiderate, and vain abuses of his Sacred Name.

{#34} Sixthly, in _Prayers, Thanksgiving, Offerings_ and _Sacrifices_, it is a
Dictate of naturall Reason, that they be every one in his kind the best, and
most significant of Honour. As for example, that Prayers, and Thanks-giving, be
made in Words and Phrases, not sudden, nor light, nor Plebeian; but beautifull,
and well composed; For else we do not God as much honour as we can. And
therefore the Heathens did absurdly, to worship Images for Gods: But their doing
it in Verse, and with Musick, both of Voyce, and Instruments, was reasonable.
Also that the Beasts they offered in sacrifice, and the Gifts they offered, and
their actions in Worshipping, were full of submission, and commemorative of
benefits received, was according to reason, as proceeding from an intention to
honour him.

{#35} Seventhly, Reason directeth not onely to worship God in Secret; but also,
and especially, in Publique, and in the sight of men: For without that, (that
which in honour is most acceptable) the procuring others to honour him, is lost.

{#36} Lastly, Obedience to his Lawes (that is, in this case to the Lawes of
Nature,) is the greatest worship of all. For as Obedience is more acceptable to
God than Sacrifice; so also to set light by his Commandements, is the greatest
of all contumelies. And these are the Lawes of that Divine Worship, which
naturall Reason dictateth to private men.

{#37} But seeing a Common-wealth is but one Person, it#_Publique Worship
consisteth in Uniformity._# tought also to exhibite to God but one Worship;
which then it doth, when it commandeth it to be exhibited by Private men,
Publiquely. And this is Publique Worship; the property whereof, is to be
_Uniforme_: For those actions that are done differently, by different men,
cannot be said to be a Publique Worship. And therefore, where many sorts of
Worship be allowed, proceeding from the different Religions of Private men, it
cannot be said there is any Publique Worship, nor that the Common-wealth is of
any Religion at all.

{#38} And because words (and consequently the Attributes#_All Attributes depend
on the Lawes Civill._# of God) have their signification by agreement, and
constitution of men; those Attributes are to be held significative of Honour,
that men intend shall so be; and whatsoever may be done by the wills of
particular men, where there is no Law but Reason, may be done by the will of the
Common-wealth, by Lawes Civill. And because a Common-wealth hath no Will, nor
makes no Lawes, but those that are made by the Will of him, or them that have
the Soveraign Power; it followeth, that those Attributes which the Soveraign
ordaineth, in the Worship of God, for signes of Honour, ought to be taken and
used for such, by private men in their publique Worship.

{#39} But because not all Actions are signes by Constitution;#_Not all
Actions._# but some are Naturally signes of Honour, others of Contumely, these
later (which are those that men are ashamed to do in the sight of them they
reverence) cannot be made by humane power a part of Divine worship; nor the
former (such as are decent, modest, humble Behaviour) ever be separated from it.
But whereas there be an infinite number of Actions, and Gestures, of an
indifferent nature; such of them as the Common-wealth shall ordain to be
Publiquely and Universally in use, as signes of Honour, and part of Gods
Worship, are to be taken and used for such by the Subjects. And that which is
said in the Scripture, _It is better to obey God than men_, hath place in the
kingdome of God by Pact, and not by Nature.

{#40} #_Naturall Punishments._# Having thus briefly spoken of the Naturall
Kingdome of God, and his Naturall Lawes, I will adde onely to this Chapter a
short declaration of his Naturall Punishments. There is no action of man in this
life, that is not the beginning of so long a Chayn of Consequences, as no humane
Providence, is high enough, to give a man a prospect to the end. And in this
Chayn, there are linked together both pleasing and unpleasing events; in such
manner, as he that will do any thing for his pleasure, must engage himselfe to
suffer all the pains annexed to it; and these pains, are the Naturall
Punishments of those actions, which are the beginning of more Harme than Good.
And hereby it comes to passe, that Intemperance, is naturally punished with
Diseases; Rashnesse, with Mischances; Injustice, with the Violence of Enemies;
Pride, with Ruine; Cowardise, with Oppression; Negligent government of Princes,
with Rebellion; and Rebellion, with Slaughter. For seeing Punishments are
consequent to the breach of Lawes; Naturall Punishments must be naturally
consequent to the breach of the Lawes of Nature; and therfore follow them as
their naturall, not arbitrary effects.

{#41} #_The Conclusion of the Second Part._# And thus farre concerning the
Constitution, Nature, and Right of Soveraigns; and concerning the Duty of
Subjects, derived from the Principles of Naturall Reason. And now, considering
how different this Doctrine is, from the Practise of the greatest part of the
world, especially of these Western parts, that have received their Morall
learning from _Rome_, and _Athens_; and how much depth of Morall Philosophy is
required, in them that have the Administration of the Soveraign Power; I am at
the point of believing this my labour, as uselesse, as the Common-wealth of
_Plato_; For he also is of opinion that it is impossible for the disorders of
State, and change of Governments by Civill Warre, ever to be taken away, till
Soveraigns be Philosophers. But when I consider again, that the Science of
Naturall Justice, is the onely Science necessary for Soveraigns, and their
principall Ministers; and that they need not be charged with the Sciences
Mathematicall, (as by _Plato_ they are,) further, than by good Lawes to
encourage men to the study of them; and that neither _Plato_, nor any other
Philosopher hitherto, hath put into order, and sufficiently or probably proved
all the Theoremes of Morall doctrine, that men may learn thereby, both how to
govern, and how to obey; I recover some hope, that one time or other, this
writing of mine, may fall into the hands of a Soveraign, who will consider it
himselfe, (for it is short, and I think clear,) without the help of any
interessed, or envious Interpreter; and by the exercise of entire Soveraignty,
in protecting the Publique teaching of it, convert this Truth of Speculation,
into the Utility of Practice.
