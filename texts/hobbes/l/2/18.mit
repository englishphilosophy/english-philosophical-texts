£1 _Of the ^Rights^ of Soveraignes by Institution._ £1

{#1} A _Common-wealth_ is said to be _Instituted_, when#_The act of Instituting
a Common-wealth, what._# a _Multitude_ of men do Agree, and _Covenant, every
one, with every one_, that to whatsoever _Man_, or _Assembly of Men_, shall be
given by the major part, the _Right_ to _Present_ the Person of them all, (that
is to say, to be their _Representative_;) every one, as well he that _Voted for
it_, as he that _Voted against it_, shall _Authorise_ all the Actions and
Judgements, of that Man, or Assembly of men, in the same manner, as if they were
his own, to the end, to live peaceably amongst themselves, and be protected
against other men.

{#2} From this Institution of a Common-wealth are derived#_The Consequences to
such Institution, are_# all the _Rights_, and _Facultyes_ of him, or them, on
whom the Soveraigne Power is conferred by the consent of the People assembled.

{#3} First, because they Covenant, it is to be understood,#_1._ The Subjects
cannot change the forme of government.# they are not obliged by former Covenant
to any thing repugnant hereunto. And Consequently they that have already
Instituted a Common-wealth, being thereby bound by Covenant, to own the Actions,
and Judgements of one, cannot lawfully make a new Covenant, amongst themselves,
to be obedient to any other, in any thing whatsoever, without his permission.
And therefore, they that are subjects to a Monarch, cannot without his leave
cast off Monarchy, and return to the confusion of a disunited Multitude; nor
transferre their Person from him that beareth it, to another Man, or other
Assembly of men: for they are bound, every man to every man, to Own, and be
reputed Author of all, that he that already is their Soveraigne, shall do, and
judge fit to be done: so that any one man dissenting, all the rest should break
their Covenant made to that man, which is injustice: and they have also every
man given the Soveraignty to him that beareth their Person; and therefore if
they depose him, they take from him that which is his own, and so again it is
injustice. Besides, if he that attempteth to depose his Soveraign, be killed, or
punished by him for such attempt, he is author of his own punishment, as being
by the Institution, Author of all his Soveraign shall do: And because it is
injustice for a man to do any thing, for which he may be punished by his own
authority, he is also upon that title, unjust. And whereas some men have
pretended for their disobedience to their Soveraign, a new Covenant, made, not
with men, but with God; this also is unjust: for there is no Covenant with God,
but by mediation of some body that representeth Gods Person; which none doth but
Gods Lieutenant, who hath the Soveraignty under God. But this pretence of
Covenant with God, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences,
that it is not onely an act of an unjust, but also of a vile, and unmanly
disposition.

{#4} #_2._ Soveraigne Power cannot be forfeited.# Secondly, Because the Right of
bearing the Person of them all, is given to him they make Soveraigne, by
Covenant onely of one to another, and not of him to any of them; there can
happen no breach of Covenant on the part of the Soveraigne; and consequently
none of his Subjects, by any pretence of forfeiture, can be freed from his
Subjection. That he which is made Soveraigne maketh no Covenant with his
Subjects before-hand, is manifest; because either he must make it with the whole
multitude, as one party to the Covenant; or he must make a severall Covenant
with every man. With the whole, as one party, it is impossible; because as yet
they are not one Person: and if he make so many severall Covenants as there be
men, those Covenants after he hath the Soveraignty are voyd, because what act
soever can be pretended by any one of them for breach thereof, is the act both
of himselfe, and of all the rest, because done in the Person, and by the Right
of every one of them in particular. Besides, if any one, or more of them,
pretend a breach of the Covenant made by the Soveraigne at his Institution; and
others, or one other of his Subjects, or himselfe alone, pretend there was no
such breach, there is in this case, no Judge to decide the controversie: it
returns therefore to the Sword again; and every man recovereth the right of
Protecting himselfe by his own strength, contrary to the designe they had in the
Institution. It is therefore in vain to grant Soveraignty by way of precedent
Covenant. The opinion that any Monarch receiveth his Power by Covenant, that is
to say on Condition, proceedeth from want of understanding this easie truth,
that Covenants being but words, and breath, have no force to oblige, contain,
constrain, or protect any man, but what it has from the publique Sword; that is,
from the untyed hands of that Man, or Assembly of men that hath the Soveraignty,
and whose actions are avouched by them all, and performed by the strength of
them all, in him united. But when an Assembly of men is made Soveraigne; then no
man imagineth any such Covenant to have past in the Institution; for no man is
so dull as to say, for example, the People of _Rome_, made a Covenant with the
Romans, to hold the Soveraignty on such or such conditions; which not performed,
the Romans might lawfully depose the Roman People. That men see not the reason
to be alike in a Monarchy, and in a Popular Government, proceedeth from the
ambition of some, that are kinder to the goverment of an Assembly, whereof they
may hope to participate, than of Monarchy, which they despair to enjoy.

{#5} #_3._ No man can without injustice protest against the Institution of the
Soveraigne declared by the major part.# Thirdly, because the major part hath by
consenting voices declared a Soveraigne; he that dissented must now consent with
the rest; that is, be contented to avow all the actions he shall do, or else
justly be destroyed by the rest. For if he voluntarily entered into the
Congregation of them that were assembled, he sufficiently declared thereby his
will (and therefore tacitely covenanted) to stand to what the major part should
ordayne: and therefore if he refuse to stand thereto, or make Protestation
against any of their Decrees, he does contrary to his Covenant, and therfore
unjustly. And whether he be of the Congregation, or not; and whether his consent
be asked, or not, he must either submit to their decrees, or be left in the
condition of warre he was in before; wherein he might without injustice be
destroyed by any man whatsoever.

{#6} #_4._ The Soveraigns Actions cannot be justly accused by the Subject.#
Fourthly, because every Subject is by this Institution Author of all the
Actions, and Judgments of the Soveraigne Instituted; it followes, that
whatsoever he doth, it can be no injury to any of his Subjects; nor ought he to
be by any of them accused of Injustice. For he that doth any thing by authority
from another, doth therein no injury to him by whose authority he acteth: But by
this Institution of a Common-wealth, every particular man is Author of all the
Soveraigne doth; and consequently he that complaineth of injury from his
Soveraigne, complaineth of that whereof he himselfe is Author; and therefore
ought not to accuse any man but himselfe; no nor himselfe of injury; because to
do injury to ones selfe, is impossible. It is true that they that have
Soveraigne power, may commit Iniquity; but not Injustice, or Injury in the
proper signification.

{#7} #_5._ What soever the Soveraigne doth, is unpunishable by the Subject.#
Fiftly, and consequently to that which was sayd last, no man that hath
Soveraigne power can iustly be put to death, or otherwise in any manner by his
Subjects punished. For seeing every Subject is Author of the actions of his
Soveraigne; he punisheth another, for the actions committed by himselfe.

{#8} #_6._ The Soveraigne is judge of what is necessary for the Peace and
Defence of his Subjects.# And because the End of this Institution, is the Peace
and Defence of them all; and whosoever has right to the End, has right to the
Means; it belongeth of Right, to whatsoever Man, or Assembly that hath the
Soveraignty, to be Judge both of the meanes of Peace and Defence; and also of
the hindrances, and disturbances of the same; and to do whatsoever he shall
think necessary to be done, both before hand, for the preserving of Peace and
Security, by prevention of Discord at home, and Hostility from abroad; and, when
Peace and Security are lost, for the recovery of the same. And therefore,

{#9} #_And Judge of what Doctrines are fit to be taught them._# Sixtly, it is
annexed to the Soveraignty, to be Judge of what Opinions and Doctrines are
averse, and what conducing to Peace; and consequently, on what occasions, how
farre, and what, men are to be trusted withall, in speaking to Multitudes of
people; and who shall examine the Doctrines of all bookes before they be
published. For the Actions of men proceed from their Opinions; and in the wel
governing of Opinions, consisteth the well governing of mens Actions, in order
to their Peace, and Concord. And though in matter of Doctrine, nothing ought to
be regarded but the Truth; yet this is not repugnant to regulating of the same
by Peace. For Doctrine repugnant to Peace, can no more be True, than Peace and
Concord can be against the Law of Nature. It is true, that in a Common-wealth,
where by the negligence, or unskilfullnesse of Governours, and Teachers, false
Doctrines are by time generally received; the contrary Truths may be generally
offensive: Yet the most sudden, and rough busling in of a new Truth, that can
be, does never breake the Peace, but only somtimes awake the Warre. For those
men that are so remissely governed, that they dare take up Armes, to defend, or
introduce an Opinion, are still in Warre; and their condition not Peace, but
only a Cessation of Armes for feare of one another; and they live as it were, in
the procincts of battaile continually. It belongeth therefore to him that hath
the Soveraign Power, to be Judge, or constitute all Judges of Opinions and
Doctrines, as a thing necessary to Peace; therby to prevent Discord and Civill
Warre.

{#10} Seventhly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the whole#_7._ The Right of
making Rules, whereby the Subjects may every man know what is so his owne, as no
other Subject can without injustice take it from him.# power of prescribing the
Rules, whereby every man may know, what Goods he may enjoy, and what Actions he
may doe, without being molested by any of his fellow Subjects: And this is it
men call _Propriety_. For before constitution of Soveraign Power (as hath
already been shewn) all men had right to all things; which necessarily causeth
Warre: and therefore this Proprietie, being necessary to Peace, and depending on
Soveraign Power, is the Act of that Power, in order to the publique peace. These
Rules of Propriety (or _Meum_ and _Tuum_) and of _Good, Evill, Lawfull_, and
_Unlawfull_ in the actions of Subjects, are the Civill Lawes; that is to say,
the Lawes of each Commonwealth in particular; though the name of Civill Law be
now restrained to the antient Civill Lawes of the City of _Rome_; which being
the head of a great part of the World, her Lawes at that time were in these
parts the Civill Law.

{#11} #_8._ To him also belongeth the Right of all Judicature and decision of
Controversies:# Eightly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the Right of
Judicature; that is to say, of hearing and deciding all Controversies, which may
arise concerning Law, either Civill, or Naturall, or concerning Fact. For
without the decision of Controversies, there is no protection of one Subject,
against the injuries of another; the Lawes concerning _Meum_ and _Tuum_ are in
vaine; and to every man remaineth, from the naturall and necessary appetite of
his own conservation, the right of protecting himselfe by his private strength,
which is the condition of Warre; and contrary to the end for which every
Common-wealth is instituted.

{#12} #_9._ And of making War, and Peace, as he shall think best:# Ninthly, is
annexed to the Soveraignty, the Right of making Warre, and Peace with other
Nations, and Common-wealths; that is to say, of Judging when it is for the
publique good, and how great forces are to be assembled, armed, and payd for
that end; and to levy mony upon the Subjects, to defray the expences thereof.
For the Power by which the people are to be defended, consisteth in their
Armies; and the strength of an Army, in the union of their strength under one
Command; which Command the Soveraign Instituted, therefore hath; because the
command of the _Militia_, without other Institution, maketh him that hath it
Soveraign. And therefore whosoever is made Generall of an Army, he that hath the
Soveraign Power is alwayes Generallissimo.

{#13} #_10._ And of choosing all Counsellours, and Ministers, both of Peace, and
Warre:# Tenthly, is annexed to the Soveraignty, the choosing of all
Counsellours, Ministers, Magistrates, and Officers, both in Peace, and War. For
seeing the Soveraign is charged with the End, which is the common Peace and
Defence; he is understood to have Power to use such Means, as he shall think
most fit for his discharge.

{#14} Eleventhly, to the Soveraign is committed the Power#_11._ And of
Rewarding, and Punishing, and that (where no former Law hath determined the
measure of it) arbitrary:# of Rewarding with riches, or honour; and of Punishing
with corporall, or pecuniary punishment, or with ignominy every Subject
according to the Law he hath formerly made; or if there be no Law made,
according as he shall judge most to conduce to the encouraging of men to serve
the Common-wealth, or deterring of them from doing dis-service to the same.

{#15} Lastly, considering what values men are naturally apt to set upon
themselves; what respect they look for from others; and how little they value
other men; from whence continually arise amongst them, Emulation,#_12._ And of
Honour and Order.# Quarrells, Factions, and at last Warre, to the destroying of
one another, and diminution of their strength against a Common Enemy; It is
necessary that there be Lawes of Honour, and a publique rate of the worth of
such men as have deserved, or are able to deserve well of the Common-wealth; and
that there be force in the hands of some or other, to put those Lawes in
execution. But it hath already been shewn, that not onely the whole _Militia_,
or forces of the Common-wealth; but also the Judicature of all Controversies, is
annexed to the Soveraignty. To the Soveraign therefore it belongeth also to give
titles of Honour; and to appoint what Order of place, and dignity, each man
shall hold; and what signes of respect, in publique or private meetings, they
shall give to one another.

{#16} These are the Rights, which make the Essence of#_These Rights
indivisible._# Soveraignty; and which are the markes, whereby a man may discern
in what Man, or Assembly of men, the Soveraign Power is placed, and resideth.
For these are incommunicable, and inseparable. The Power to coyn Mony; to
dispose of the estate and persons of Infant heires; to have pr{ae}emption in
Markets; and all other Statute Pr{ae}rogatives, may be transferred by the
Soveraign; and yet the Power to protect his Subjects be retained. But if he
transferre the _Militia_, he retains the Judicature in vain, for want of
execution of the Lawes: Or if he grant away the Power of raising Mony; the
_Militia_ is in vain: or if he give away the government of Doctrines, men will
be frighted into rebellion with the feare of Spirits. And so if we consider any
one of the said Rights, we shall presently see, that the holding of all the
rest, will produce no effect, in the conservation of Peace and Justice, the end
for which all Common-wealths are Instituted. And this division is it, whereof it
is said, _a Kingdome divided in it selfe cannot stand_: For unlesse this
division precede, division into opposite Armies can never happen. If there had
not first been an opinion received of the greatest part of _England_, that these
Powers were divided between the King, and the Lords, and the House of Commons,
the people had never been divided, and fallen into this Civill Warre; first
between those that disagreed in Politiques; and after between the Dissenters
about the liberty of Religion; which have so instructed men in this point of
Soveraign Right, that there be few now (in _England_,) that do not see, that
these Rights are inseparable, and will be so generally acknowledged, at the next
return of Peace; and so continue, till their miseries are forgotten; and no
longer, except the vulgar be better taught than they have hetherto been.

{#17} #_And can by no Grant passe away without direct renouncing of the
Soveraign Power._# And because they are essentiall and inseparable Rights, it
follows necessarily, that in whatsoever words any of them seem to be granted
away, yet if the Soveraign Power it selfe be not in direct termes renounced, and
the name of Soveraign no more given by the Grantees to him that Grants them, the
Grant is voyd: for when he has granted all he can, if we grant back the
Soveraignty, all is restored, as inseparably annexed thereunto.

{#18} #_The Power and Honour of Subjects vanisheth in the presence of the Power
Soveraign._# This great Authority being Indivisible, and inseparably annexed to
the Soveraignty, there is little ground for the opinion of them, that say of
Soveraign Kings, though they be _singulis majores_, of greater Power than every
one of their Subjects, yet they be _Universis minores_, of lesse power than them
all together. For if by _all together_, they mean not the collective body as one
person, then _all together_, and _every one_, signifie the same; and the speech
is absurd. But if by _all together_, they understand them as one Person (which
person the Soveraign bears,) then the power of all together, is the same with
the Soveraigns power; and so again the speech is absurd: which absurdity they
see well enough, when the Soveraignty is in an Assembly of the people; but in a
Monarch they see it not; and yet the power of Soveraignty is the same in
whomsoever it be placed.

{#19} And as the Power, so also the Honour of the Soveraign, ought to be
greater, than that of any, or all the Subjects. For in the Soveraignty is the
fountain of Honour. The dignities of Lord, Earle, Duke, and Prince are his
Creatures. As in the presence of the Master, the Servants are equall, and
without any honour at all; So are the Subjects, in the presence of the
Soveraign. And though they shine some more, some lesse, when they are out of his
sight; yet in his presence, they shine no more than the Starres in presence of
the Sun.

{#20} But a man may here object, that the Condition of Subjects is very
miserable; as being obnoxious to the#_Soveraigne Power not so hurtfull as the
want of it, and the hurt proceeds for the greatest part from not submitting
readily, to a lesse._# lusts, and other irregular passions of him, or them that
have so unlimited a Power in their hands. And commonly they that live under a
Monarch, think it the fault of Monarchy; and they that live under the government
of Democracy, or other Soveraign Assembly, attribute all the inconvenience to
that forme of Commonwealth; whereas the Power in all formes, if they be perfect
enough to protect them, is the same; not considering that the estate of Man can
never be without some incommodity or other; and that the greatest, that in any
forme of Government can possibly happen to the people in generall, is scarce
sensible, in respect of the miseries, and horrible calamities, that accompany a
Civill Warre; or that dissolute condition of masterlesse men, without subjection
to Lawes, and a coercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge: nor
considering that the greatest pressure of Soveraign Governours, proceedeth not
from any delight, or profit they can expect in the dammage, or weakening of
their Subjects, in whose vigor, consisteth their own strength and glory; but in
the restiveness of themselves, that unwillingly contributing to their own
defence, make it necessary for their Governours to draw from them what they can
in time of Peace, that they may have means on any emergent occasion, or sudden
need, to resist, or take advantage on their Enemies. For all men are by nature
provided of notable multiplying glasses, (that is their Passions and
Selfe-love,) through which, every little payment appeareth a great grievance;
but are destitute of those prospective glasses, (namely Morall and Civill
Science,) to see a farre off the miseries that hang over them, and cannot
without such payments be avoyded.
