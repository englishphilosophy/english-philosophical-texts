£1 _Of ^Civill Lawes^._ £1

{#1} ^By Civill Lawes^, I understand the Lawes, that#_Civill Law what._# men
are therefore bound to observe, because they are Members, not of this, or that
Common-wealth in particular, but of a Common-wealth. For the knowledge of
particular Lawes belongeth to them, that professe the study of the Lawes of
their severall Countries; but the knowledge of Civill Law in generall, to any
man. The antient Law of _Rome_ was called their _Civil Law_, from the word
_Civitas_, which signifies a Common-wealth: And those Countries, which having
been under the Roman Empire, and governed by that Law, retaine still such part
thereof as they think fit, call that part the Civill Law, to distinguish it from
the rest of their own Civill Lawes. But that is not it I intend to speak of
here; my designe being not to shew what is Law here, and there; but what is Law;
as _Plato, Aristotle, Cicero_, and divers others have done, without taking upon
them the profession of the study of the Law.

{#2} And first it is manifest, that Law in generall, is not Counsell, but
Command; nor a Command of any man to any man; but only of him, whose Command is
addressed to one formerly obliged to obey him. And as for Civill Law, it addeth
only the name of the person Commanding, which is _Persona Civitatis_, the Person
of the Common-wealth.

{#3} Which considered, I define Civill Law in this manner. ^Civill^ ^Law^, _Is
to every Subject, those Rules, which the Common-wealth hath Commanded him, by
Word, Writing, or other sufficient Sign of the Will, to make use of, for the
Distinction of Right, and Wrong; that is to say, of what is contrary, and what
is not contrary to the Rule_.

{#4} In which definition, there is nothing that is not at first sight evident.
For every man seeth, that some Lawes are addressed to all the Subjects in
generall; some to particular Provinces; some to particular Vocations; and some
to particular Men; and are therefore Lawes, to every of those to whom the
Command is directed; and to none else. As also, that Lawes are the Rules of
Just, and Unjust; nothing being reputed Unjust, that is not contrary to some
Law. Likewise, that none can make Lawes but the Common-wealth; because our
Subjection is to the Common-wealth only: and that Commands, are to be signified
by sufficient Signs; because a man knows not otherwise how to obey them. And
therefore, whatsoever can from this definition by necessary consequence be
deduced, ought to be acknowledged for truth. Now I deduce from it this that
followeth.

{#5} 1.#_The Soveraign is Legislator._# The Legislator in all Common-wealths, is
only the Soveraign, be he one Man, as in a Monarchy, or one Assembly of men, as
in a Democracy, or Aristocracy. For the Legislator, is he that maketh the Law.
And the Common-wealth only, pr{ae}cribes, and commandeth the observation of
those rules, which we call Law: Therefore the Common-wealth is the Legislator.
But the Common-wealth is no Person, nor has capacity to doe any thing, but by
the Representative, (that is, the Soveraign;) and therefore the Soveraign is the
sole Legislator. For the same reason, none can abrogate a Law made, but the
Soveraign; because a Law is not abrogated, but by another Law, that forbiddeth
it to be put in execution.

{#6} 2.#_And not Subject to Civill Law._# The Soveraign of a Common-wealth, be
it an Assembly, or one Man, is not Subject to the Civill Lawes. For having power
to make, and repeale Lawes, he may when he pleaseth, free himselfe from that
subjection, by repealing those Lawes that trouble him, and making of new; and
consequently he was free before. For he is free, that can be free when he will:
Nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe; because he that can
bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to himselfe onely, is not
bound.

{#7} 3.#_Use, a Law not by vertue of Time, but of the Soveraigns consent._# Then
long Use obtaineth the authority of a Law, it is not the Length of Time that
maketh the Authority, but the Will of the Soveraign signified by his silence,
(for Silence is sometimes an argument of Consent;) and it is no longer Law, then
the Soveraign shall be silent therein. And therefore if the Soveraign shall have
a question of Right grounded, not upon his present Will, but upon the Lawes
formerly made; the Length of Time shal bring no prejudice to his Right; but the
question shal be judged by Equity. For many unjust Actions, and unjust
Sentences, go uncontrolled a longer time, than any man can remember. And our
Lawyers account no Customes Law, but such as are reasonable, and that evill
Customes are to be abolished: But the Judgement of what is reasonable, and of
what is to be abolished, belongeth to him that maketh the Law, which is the
Soveraign Assembly, or Monarch.

{#8} 4. The Law of Nature, and the Civill Law, contain#_The Law of Nature, and
the Civill Law contain each other._# each other, and are of equall extent. For
the Lawes of Nature, which consist in Equity, Justice, Gratitude, and other
morall Vertues on these depending, in the condition of meer Nature (as I have
said before in the end of the 15th Chapter,) are not properly Lawes, but
qualities that dispose men to peace, and to obedience. When a Common-wealth is
once settled, then are they actually Lawes, and not before; as being then the
commands of the Common-wealth; and therefore also Civill Lawes: For it is the
Soveraign Power that obliges men to obey them. For in the differences of private
men, to declare, what is Equity, what is Justice, and what is morall Vertue, and
to make them binding, there is need of the Ordinances of Soveraign Power, and
Punishments to be ordained for such as shall break them; which Ordinances are
therefore part of the Civill Law. The Law of Nature therefore is a part of the
Civill Law in all Common-wealths of the world. Reciprocally also, the Civill Law
is a part of the Dictates of Nature. For Justice, that is to say, Performance of
Covenant, and giving to every man his own, is a Dictate of the Law of Nature.
But every subject in a Common-wealth, hath covenanted to obey the Civill Law,
(either one with another, as when they assemble to make a common Representative,
or with the Representative it selfe one by one, when subdued by the Sword they
promise obedience, that they may receive life;) And therefore Obedience to the
Civill, Law is part also of the Law of Nature. Civill, and Naturall Law are not
different kinds, but different parts of Law; whereof one part being written, is
called Civill, the other unwritten, Naturall. But the Right of Nature, that is,
the naturall Liberty of man, may by the Civill Law be abridged, and restrained:
nay, the end of making Lawes, is no other, but such Restraint; without the which
there cannot possibly be any Peace. And Law was brought into the world for
nothing else, but to limit the naturall liberty of particular men, in such
manner, as they might not hurt, but assist one another, and joyn together
against a common Enemy.

{#9} 5.#_Provinciall Lawes are not made by Custome, but by the Soveraign
Power._# If the Soveraign of one Common-wealth, subdue a People that have lived
under other written Lawes, and afterwards govern them by the same Lawes, by
which they were governed before; yet those Lawes are the Civill Lawes of the
Victor, and not of the Vanquished Common-wealth. For the Legislator is he, not
by whose authority the Lawes were first made, but by whose authority they now
continue to be Lawes. And therefore where there be divers Provinces, within the
Dominion of a Common-wealth, and in those Provinces diversity of Lawes, which
commonly are called the Customes of each severall Province, we are not to
understand that such Customes have their force, onely from Length of Time; but
that they were antiently Lawes written, or otherwise made known, for the
Constitutions, and Statutes of their Soveraigns; and are now Lawes, not by
vertue of the Pr{ae}scription of time, but by the Constitutions of their present
Soveraigns. But if an unwritten Law, in all the Provinces of a Dominion, shall
be generally observed, and no iniquity appear in the use thereof; that Law can
be no other but a Law of Nature, equally obliging all man-kind.

{#10} 6.#_Some foolish opinions of Lawyers concerning the making of Lawes._#
Seeing then all Lawes, written, and unwritten, have their Authority, and force,
from the Will of the Common-wealth; that is to say, from the Will of the
Representative; which in a Monarchy is the Monarch, and in other Common-wealths
the Soveraign Assembly; a man may wonder from whence proceed such opinions, as
are found in the Books of Lawyers of eminence in severall Common-wealths,
directly, or by consequence making the Legislative Power depend on private men,
or subordinate Judges. As for example, _That the Common Law hath no Controuler
but the Parlament_; which is true onely where a Parlament has the Soveraign
Power, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved, but by their own discretion. For
if there be a right in any else to dissolve them, there is a right also to
controule them, and consequently to controule their controulings. And if there
be no such right, then the Controuler of Lawes is not _Parlamentum_, but _Rex in
Parlamento_. And where a Parlament is Soveraign, if it should assemble never so
many, or so wise men, from the Countries subject to them, for whatsoever cause;
yet there is no man will believe, that such an Assembly hath thereby acquired to
themselves a Legislative Power. _Item_, that the two arms of a Common-wealth,
are _Force, and Justice; the first whereof is in the King; the other deposited
in the hands of the Parlament_. As if a Common-wealth could consist, where the
Force were in any hand, which Justice had not the Authority to command and
govern.

{#11} 7. That Law can never be against Reason, our Lawyers are agreed; and that
not the Letter, (that is, every construction of it,) but that which is according
to the Intention of the Legislator, is the Law. And it is true: but the doubt
is, of whose Reason it is, that shall be received for Law. It is not meant of
any private Reason; for then there would be as much contradiction in the Lawes,
as there is in the Schooles; nor yet, (as Sr. _Ed. Coke_ #_Sir Edw. Coke, upon
Littleton, Lib. 2. Ch. 6. fol. 97.b._# makes it,) an _Artificiall perfection of
Reason, gotten by long study, observation, and experience_, (as his was.) For it
is possible long study may encrease, and confirm erroneous Sentences: and where
men build on false grounds, the more they build, the greater is the ruine: and
of those that study, and observe with equall time, and diligence, the reasons
and resolutions are, and must remain discordant: and therefore it is not that
_Juris prudentia_, or wisedome of subordinate Judges; but the Reason of this our
Artificiall Man the Common-wealth, and his Command, that maketh Law: And the
Common-wealth being in their Representative but one Person, there cannot easily
arise any contradiction in the Lawes; and when there doth, the same Reason is
able, by interpretation, or alteration, to take it away. In all Courts of
Justice, the Soveraign (which is the Person of the Common-wealth,) is he that
Judgeth: The subordinate Judge, ought to have regard to the reason, which moved
his Soveraign to make such Law, that his Sentence may be according thereunto;
which then is his Soveraigns Sentence; otherwise it is his own, and an unjust
one.

{#12} 8.#_Law made, if not also made known, is no Law._# From this, that the Law
is a Command, and a Command consisteth in declaration, or manifestation of the
will of him that commandeth, by voyce, writing, or some other sufficient
argument of the same, we may understand, that the Command of the Common-wealth,
is Law onely to those, that have means to take notice of it. Over naturall
fooles, children, or mad-men there is no Law, no more than over brute beasts;
nor are they capable of the title of just, or unjust; because they had never
power to make any covenant, or to understand the consequences thereof; and
consequently never took upon them to authorise the actions of any Soveraign, as
they must do that make to themselves a Common-wealth. And as those from whom
Nature, or Accident hath taken away the notice of all Lawes in generall; so also
every man, from whom any accident, not proceeding from his own default, hath
taken away the means to take notice of any particular Law, is excused, if he
observe it not; And to speak properly, that Law is no Law to him. It is
therefore necessary, to consider in this place, what arguments, and signes be
sufficient for the knowledge of what is the Law; that is to say, what is the
will of the Soveraign, as well in Monarchies, as in other formes of government.

{#13} #_Unwritten Lawes are all of them Lawes of Nature._# And first, if it be a
Law that obliges all the Subjects without exception, and is not written, nor
otherwise published in such places as they may take notice thereof, it is a Law
of Nature. For whatsoever men are to take knowledge of for Law, not upon other
mens words, but every one from his own reason, must be such as is agreeable to
the reason of all men; which no Law can be, but the Law of Nature. The Lawes of
Nature therefore need not any publishing, nor Proclamation; as being contained
in this one Sentence, approved by all the world, _Do not that to another, which
thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by another to thy selfe_.

{#14} Secondly, if it be a Law that obliges only some condition of men, or one
particular man, and be not written, nor published by word, then also it is a Law
of Nature; and known by the same arguments, and signs, that distinguish those in
such a condition, from other Subjects. For whatsoever Law is not written, or
some way published by him that makes it Law, can be known no way, but by the
reason of him that is to obey it; and is therefore also a Law not only Civill,
but Naturall. For Example, if the Soveraign employ a Publique Minister, without
written Instructions what to doe; he is obliged to take for Instructions the
Dictates of Reason; As if he make a Judge, The Judge is to take notice, that his
Sentence ought to be according to the reason of his Soveraign, which being
alwaies understood to be Equity, he is bound to it by the Law of Nature: Or if
an Ambassador, he is (in all things not conteined in his written Instructions)
to take for Instruction that which Reason dictates to be most conducing to his
Soveraigns interest; and so of all other Ministers of the Soveraignty, publique
and private. All which Instructions of naturall Reason may be comprehended under
one name of _Fidelity_; which is a branch of naturall Justice.

{#15} The Law of Nature excepted, it belongeth to the essence of all other
Lawes, to be made known, to every man that shall be obliged to obey them, either
by word, or writing, or some other act, known to proceed from the Soveraign
Authority. For the will of another, cannot be understood, but by his own word,
or act, or by conjecture taken from his scope and purpose; which in the person
of the Common-wealth, is to be supposed alwaies consonant to Equity and Reason.
And in antient time, before letters were in common use, the Lawes were many
times put into verse; that the rude people taking pleasure in singing, or
reciting them, might the more easily reteine them in memory. And for the same
reason _Solomon_ adviseth a man, to bind the ten Commandements #_Prov. 7. 3._#
upon his ten fingers. And for the Law which _Moses_ gave to the people of
_Israel_ at the renewing of the Covenant, #_Deut. 11. 19._# he biddeth them
to teach it their Children, by discoursing of it both at home, and upon the way;
at going to bed, and at rising from bed; and to write it upon the posts, and
dores of their houses; and #_Deut. 31. 12._# to assemble the people, man,
woman, and child, to heare it read.

{#16} #_Nothing is Law where the Legislator cannot be known._# Nor is it enough
the Law be written, and published; but also that there be manifest signs, that
it proceedeth from the will of the Soveraign. For private men, when they have,
or think they have force enough to secure their unjust designes, and convoy them
safely to their ambitious ends, may publish for Lawes what they please, without,
or against the Legislative Authority. There is therefore requisite, not only a
Declaration of the Law, but also sufficient signes of the Author, and Authority.
The Author, or Legislator is supposed in every Common-wealth to be evident,
because he is the Soveraign, who having been Constituted by the consent of every
one, is supposed by every one to be sufficiently known. And though the
ignorance, and security of men be such, for the most part, as that when the
memory of the first Constitution of their Common-wealth is worn out, they doe
not consider, by whose power they use to be defended against their enemies, and
to have their industry protected, and to be righted when injury is done them;
yet because no man that considers, can make question of it, no excuse can be
derived from the ignorance of where the Soveraignty is placed. And it is a
Dictate of Naturall Reason, and consequently an evident Law of Nature, that no
man ought to weaken that power, the protection whereof he hath himself demanded,
or wittingly received against others. Therefore of who is Soveraign, no man, but
by his own fault, (whatsoever evill men suggest,) can make any doubt. The
difficulty consisteth in the evidence of the Authority derived from him; The
removing whereof, dependeth on the knowledge of the publique Registers, publique
Counsels, publique Ministers, and publique#_Difference between Verifying and
Authorising._# eales; by which all Lawes are sufficiently verified; Verifyed, I
say, not Authorised: for the Verification, is but the Testimony and Record; not
the Authority of the Law; which consisteth in the Command of the Soveraign only.

{#17} If therefore a man have a question of Injury, depending#_The Law Verifyed
by the subordinate Judge._# on the Law of Nature; that is to say, on common
Equity; the Sentence of the Judge, that by Commission hath Authority to take
cognisance of such causes, is a sufficient Verification of the Law of Nature in
that individuall case. For though the advice of one that professeth the study of
the Law, be usefull for the avoyding of contention; yet it is but advice: tis
the Judge must tell men what is Law, upon the hearing of the Controversy.

{#18} But when the question is of injury, or crime, upon#_By the Publique
Registers._# a written Law; every man by recourse to the Registers, by himself,
or others, may (if he will) be sufficiently enformed, before he doe such injury,
or commit the crime, whither it be an injury, or not: Nay he ought to doe so:
For when a man doubts whether the act he goeth about, be just, or injust; and
may informe himself, if he will; the doing is unlawfull. In like manner, he that
supposeth himself injured, in a case determined by the written Law, which he may
by himself, or others see and consider; if he complaine before he consults with
the Law, he does unjustly, and bewrayeth a disposition rather to vex other men,
than to demand his own right.

{#19} If the question be of Obedience to a publique Officer;#_By Letters Patent,
and Publique Seale._# To have seen his Commission, with the Publique Seale, and
heard it read; or to have had the means to be informed of it, if a man would, is
a sufficient Verification of his Authority. For every man is obliged to doe his
best endeavour, to informe himself of all written Lawes, that may concerne his
own future actions.

{#20} The Legislator known; and the Lawes, either by writing,#_The
Interpretation of the Law dependeth on the Soveraign Power._# or by the light of
Nature, sufficiently published; there wanteth yet another very materiall
circumstance to make them obligatory. For it is not the Letter, but the
Intendment, or Meaning; that is to say, the authentique Interpretation of the
Law (which is the sense of the Legislator,) in which the nature of the Law
consisteth; And therefore the Interpretation of all Lawes dependeth on the
Authority Soveraign; and the Interpreters can be none but those, which the
Soveraign, (to whom only the Subject oweth obedience) shall appoint. For else,
by the craft of an Interpreter, the Law may be made to beare a sense, contrary
to that of the Soveraign; by which means the Interpreter becomes the Legislator.

{#21} #_All Lawes need Interpretation._# All Laws, written, and unwritten, have
need of Interpretation. The unwritten Law of Nature, though it be easy to such,
as without partiality, and passion, make use of their naturall reason, and
therefore leaves the violaters thereof without excuse; yet considering there be
very few, perhaps none, that in some cases are not blinded by self love, or some
other passion, it is now become of all Laws the most obscure; and has
consequently the greatest need of able Interpreters. The written Laws, if they
be short, are easily mis-interpreted, from the divers significations of a word,
or two: if long they be more obscure by the diverse significations of many
words: in so much as no written Law, delivered in few, or many words, can be
well understood, without a perfect understanding of the finall causes, for which
the Law was made; the knowledge of which finall causes is in the Legislator. To
him therefore there can not be any knot in the Law, insoluble; either by finding
out the ends, to undoe it by; or else by making what ends he will, (as
_Alexander_ did with his sword in the Gordian knot,) by the Legislative power;
which no other Interpreter can doe.

{#22} #_The Authenticall Interpretation of Law is not that of writers._# The
Interpretation of the Lawes of Nature, in a Common-wealth, dependeth not on the
books of Morall Philosophy. The Authority of writers, without the Authority of
the Common-wealth, maketh not their opinions Law, be they never so true. That
which I have written in this Treatise, concerning the Morall Vertues, and of
their necessity, for the procuring, and maintaining peace, though it bee evident
Truth, is not therefore presently Law; but because in all Common-wealths in the
world, it is part of the Civill Law: For though it be naturally reasonable; yet
it is by the Soveraigne Power that it is Law: Otherwise, it were a great errour,
to call the Lawes of Nature unwritten Law; whereof wee see so many volumes
published, and in them so many contradictions of one another, and of themselves.

{#23} The Interpretation of the Law of Nature, is the#_The Interpreter of the
Law is the Judge giving sentence vivà voce in every particular case._# entence
of the Judge constituted by the Soveraign Authority, to heare and determine such
controversies, as depend thereon; and consisteth in the application of the Law
to the present case. For in the act of Judicature, the Judge doth no more but
consider, whither the demand of the party, be consonant to naturall reason, and
Equity; and the Sentence he giveth, is therefore the Interpretation of the Law
of Nature; which Interpretation is Authentique; not because it is his private
Sentence; but because he giveth it by Authority of the Soveraign, whereby it
becomes the Soveraigns Sentence; which is Law for that time, to the parties
pleading.

{#24} But because there is no Judge Subordinate, nor Soveraign, but may erre in
a Judgement of Equity; if afterward#_The Sentence of a Judge, does not bind him,
or another Judge to give like Sentence in like Cases ever after._# in another
like case he find it more consonant to Equity to give a contrary Sentence, he is
obliged to doe it. No mans error becomes his own Law; nor obliges him to persist
in it. Neither (for the same reason) becomes it a Law to other Judges, though
sworn to follow it. For though a wrong Sentence given by authority of the
Soveraign, if he know and allow it, in such Lawes as are mutable, be a
constitution of a new Law, in cases, in which every little circumstance is the
same; yet in Lawes immutable, such as are the Lawes of Nature, they are no Lawes
to the same, or other Judges, in the like cases for ever after. Princes succeed
one another; and one Judge passeth, another commeth; nay, Heaven and Earth shall
passe; but not one title of the Law of Nature shall passe; for it is the
Eternall Law of God. Therefore all the Sentences of precedent Judges that have
ever been, cannot all together make a Law contrary to naturall Equity: Nor any
Examples of former Judges, can warrant an unreasonable Sentence, or discharge
the present Judge of the trouble of studying what is Equity (in the case he is
to Judge,) from the principles of his own naturall reason. For example sake,
'Tis against the Law of Nature, _To punish the Innocent_; and Innocent is he
that acquitteth himselfe Judicially, and is acknowledged for Innocent by the
Judge. Put the case now, that a man is accused of a capitall crime, and seeing
the power and malice of some enemy, and the frequent corruption and partiality
of Judges, runneth away for feare of the event, and afterwards is taken, and
brought to a legall triall, and maketh it sufficiently appear, he was not guilty
of the crime, and being thereof acquitted, is neverthelesse condemned to lose
his goods; this is a manifest condemnation of the Innocent. I say therefore,
that there is no place in the world, where this can be an interpretation of a
Law of Nature, or be made a Law by the Sentences of precedent Judges, that had
done the same. For he that judged it first, judged unjustly; and no Injustice
can be a pattern of Judgement to succeeding Judges. A written Law may forbid
innocent men to fly, and they may be punished for flying: But that flying for
feare of injury, should be taken for presumption of guilt, after a man is
already absolved of the crime Judicially, is contrary to the nature of a
Presumption, which hath no place after Judgement given. Yet this is set down by
a great Lawyer for the common Law of _England. If a man_ (saith he) _that is
Innocent, be accused of Felony, and for feare flyeth for the same; albeit he
judicially acquitteth himselfe of the Felony; yet if it be found that he field
for the Felony, he shall notwithstanding his Innocency, Forfeit all his goods,
chattells, debts, and duties. For as to the Forfeiture of them, the Law will
admit no proofe against the Presumption in Law, grounded upon his flight_. Here
you see, _An Innocent man, Judicially acquitted, notwithstanding his Innocency_,
(when no written Law forbad him to fly) after his acquitall, _upon a Presumption
in Law_, condemned to lose all the goods he hath. If the Law ground upon his
flight a Presumption of the fact, (which was Capitall,) the Sentence ought to
have been Capitall: if the Presumption were not of the Fact, for what then ought
he to lose his goods? This therefore is no Law of _England_; nor is the
condemnation grounded upon a Presumption of Law, but upon the Presumption of the
Judges. It is also against Law, to say that no Proofe shall be admitted against
a Presumption of Law. For all Judges, Soveraign and subordinate, if they refuse
to heare Proofe, refuse to do Justice: for though the Sentence be Just, yet the
Judges that condemn without hearing the Proofes offered, are Unjust Judges, and
their Presumption is but Prejudice; which no man ought to bring with him to the
Seat of Justice, whatsoever precedent judgements, or examples he shall pretend
to follow. There be other things of this nature, wherein mens Judgements have
been perverted, by trusting to Precedents: but this is enough to shew, that
though the Sentence of the Judge, be a Law to the party pleading, yet it is no
Law to any Judge, that shall succeed him in that Office.

{#25} In like manner, when question is of the Meaning of written Lawes, he is
not the Interpreter of them, that writeth a Commentary upon them. For
Commentaries are commonly more subject to cavill, than the Text; and therefore
need other Commentaries; and so there will be no end of such Interpretation. And
therefore unlesse there be an Interpreter authorised by the Soveraign, from
which the subordinate Judges are not to recede, the Interpreter can be no other
than the ordinary Judges, in the same manner, as they are in cases of the
unwritten Law; and their Sentences are to be taken by them that plead, for Lawes
in that particular case; but not to bind other Judges, in like cases to give
like judgements. For a Judge may erre in the Interpretation even of written
Lawes; but no errour of a subordinate Judge, can change the Law, which is the
generall Sentence of the Soveraigne.

{#26} In written Lawes, men use to make a difference#_The difference between the
Letter and Sentence of the Law._# between the Letter, and the Sentence of the
Law: And when by the Letter, is meant whatsoever can be gathered from the bare
words, 'tis well distinguished. For the significations of almost all words, are
either in themselves, or in the metaphoricall use of them, ambiguous; and may be
drawn in argument, to make many senses; but there is onely one sense of the Law.
But if by the Letter, be meant the literall sense, then the Letter, and the
Sentence or intention of the Law, is all one. For the literall sense is that,
which the Legislator intended, should by the letter of the Law be signified. Now
the Intention of the Legislator is alwayes supposed to be Equity: For it were a
great contumely for a Judge to think otherwise of the Soveraigne. He ought
therefore, if the Word of the Law doe not fully authorise a reasonable Sentence,
to supply it with the Law of Nature; or if the case be difficult, to respit
Judgement till he have received more ample authority. For Example, a written Law
ordaineth, that he which is thrust out of his house by force, shall be restored
by force: It happens that a man by negligence leaves his house empty, and
returning is kept out by force, in which case there is no speciall Law ordained.
It is evident, that this case is contained in the same Law: for else there is no
remedy for him at all; which is to be supposed against the Intention of the
Legislator. Again, the word of the Law, commandeth to Judge according to the
Evidence: A man is accused falsly of a fact, which the Judge saw himself done by
another; and not by him that is accused. In this case neither shall the Letter
of the Law be followed to the condemnation of the Innocent, nor shall the Judge
give Sentence against the evidence of the Witnesses; because the Letter of the
Law is to the contrary: but procure of the Soveraign that another be made Judge,
and himself Witnesse. So that the incommodity that follows the bare words of a
written Law, may lead him to the Intention of the Law, whereby to interpret the
same the better; though no Incommodity can warrant a Sentence against the Law.
For every Judge of Right, and Wrong, is not Judge of what is Commodious, or
Incommodious to the Common-wealth.

{#27} #_The abilities required in a Judge._# The abilities required in a good
Interpreter of the Law, that is to say, in a good Judge, are not the same with
those of an Advocate; namely the study of the Lawes. For a Judge, as he ought to
take notice of the Fact, from none but the Witnesses; so also he ought to take
notice of the Law, from nothing but the Statutes, and Constitutions of the
Soveraign, alledged in the pleading, or declared to him by some that have
authority from the Soveraign Power to declare them; and need not take care
before-hand, what hee shall Judge; for it shall bee given him what hee shall say
concerning the Fact, by Witnesses; and what hee shall say in point of Law, from
those that shall in their pleadings shew it, and by authority interpret it upon
the place. The Lords of Parlament in _England_ were Judges, and most difficult
causes have been heard and determined by them; yet few of them were much versed
in the study of the Lawes, and fewer had made profession of them: and though
they consulted with Lawyers, that were appointed to be present there for that
purpose; yet they alone had the authority of giving Sentence. In like manner, in
the ordinary trialls of Right, Twelve men of the common People, are the Judges,
and give Sentence, not onely of the Fact, but of the Right; and pronounce simply
for the Complaynant, or for the Defendant; that is to say, are Judges not onely
of the Fact, but also of the Right: and in a question of crime, not onely
determine whether done, or not done; but also whether it be _Murder, Homicide,
Felony, Assault_, and the like, which are determinations of Law: but because
they are not supposed to know the Law of themselves, there is one that hath
Authority to enforme them of it, in the particular case they are to Judge of.
But yet if they judge not according to that he tells them, they are not subject
thereby to any penalty; unlesse it be made appear, they did it against their
consciences, or had been corrupted by reward.

{#28} The things that make a good Judge, or good Interpreter of the Lawes, are,
first, _A right understanding_ of that principall Law of Nature called _Equity_;
which depending not on the reading of other mens Writings, but on the goodnesse
of a mans own naturall Reason, and Meditation, is presumed to be in those most,
that have had most leisure, and had the most inclination to meditate thereon.
Secondly, _Contempt of unnecessary Riches_, and Preferments. Thirdly, _To be
able in judgement to devest himselfe of all feare, anger, hatred, love_, and
_compassion_. Fourthly, and lastly, _Patience to heare; diligent attention in
hearing; and memory to retain, digest and apply what he hath heard_.

{#29} The difference and division of the Lawes, has been#_Divisions of Law._#
made in divers manners, according to the different methods, of those men that
have written of them. For it is a thing that dependeth not on Nature, but on the
scope of the Writer; and is subservient to every mans proper method. In the
Institutions of _Justinian_, we find seven sorts of Civill Lawes. 1 The _Edicts,
Constitutions_, and _Epistles of the Prince_, that is, of the Emperour; because
the whole power of the people was in him. Like these, are the Proclamations of
the Kings of _England_.

{#30} 2. _The Decrees of the whole people of Rome_ (comprehending the Senate,)
when they were put to the Question by the _Senate_. These were Lawes, at first,
by the vertue of the Soveraign Power residing in the people; and such of them as
by the Emperours were not abrogated, remained Lawes by the Authority Imperiall.
For all Lawes that bind, are understood to be Lawes by his authority that has
power to repeale them. Somewhat like to these Lawes, are the Acts of Parliament
in England.

{#31} 3. _The Decrees of the Common people_ (excluding the Senate,) when they
were put to the question by the _Tribune_ of the people. For such of them as
were not abrogated by the Emperours, remained Lawes by the Authority Imperiall.
Like to these, were the Orders of the House of Commons in _England_.

{#32} 4. _Senatús consulta_, the _Orders of the Senate_; because when the people
of _Rome_ grew so numerous, as it was inconvenient to assemble them; it was
thought fit by the Emperour, that men should Consult the Senate, in stead of the
people: And these have some resemblance with the Acts of Counsell.

{#33} 5. _The Edicts of Pr{oe}tors_, and (in some Cases) of the _{AE}diles_:
such as are the Chiefe Justices in the Courts of _England_.

{#34} 6. _Responsa Prudentum_; which were the Sentences, and Opinions of those
Lawyers, to whom the Emperour gave Authority to interpret the Law, and to give
answer to such as in matter of Law demanded their advice; which Answers, the
Judges in giving Judgement were obliged by the Constitutions of the Emperour to
observe: And should be like the Reports of Cases Judged, if other Judges be by
the Law of _England_ bound to observe them. For the Judges of the Common Law of
_England_, are not properly Judges, but _Juris Consulti_; of whom the Judges,
who are either the Lords, or Twelve men of the Country, are in point of Law to
ask advice.

{#35} 7. Also, _Unwritten Customes_, (which in their own nature are an imitation
of Law,) by the tacite consent of the Emperour, in case they be not contrary to
the Law of Nature, are very Lawes.

{#36} Another division of Lawes, is into _Naturall_ and _Positive_. _Naturall_
are those which have been Lawes from all Eternity; and are called not onely
_Naturall_, but also _Morall_ Lawes; consisting in the Morall Vertues, as
Justice, Equity, and all habits of the mind that conduce to Peace, and Charity;
of which I have already spoken in the fourteenth and fifteenth Chapters.

{#37} _Positive_, are those which have not been from Eternity; but have been
made Lawes by the Will of those that have had the Soveraign Power over others;
and are either written, or made known to men, by some other argument of the Will
of their Legislator.

{#38} Again, of Positive Lawes, some are _Humane_, some _Divine:_#_Another
Division of Law._# and of Humane positive lawes, some are _Distributive_, some
_Penal. Distributive_ are those that determine the Rights of the Subjects,
declaring to every man what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety
in lands, or goods, and a right or liberty of action: and these speak to all the
Subjects. _Penal_ are those, which declare, what Penalty shall be inflicted on
those that violate the Law; and speak to the Ministers and Officers ordained for
execution. For though every one ought to be informed of the Punishments ordained
beforehand for their transgression; neverthelesse the Command is not addressed
to the Delinquent, (who cannot be supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,) but
to publique Ministers appointed to see the Penalty executed. And these Penal
Lawes are for the most part written together with the Lawes Distributive; and
are sometimes called Judgements. For all Lawes are generall Judgements, or
Sentences of the Legislator; as also every particular Judgement, is a Law to
him, whose case is Judged.

{#39} _Divine Positive Lawes_ (for Naturall Lawes being#_Divine Positive Law how
made known to be Law._# Eternall, and Universall, are all Divine,) are those,
which being the Commandements of God, (not from all Eternity, nor universally
addressed to all men, but onely to a certain people, or to certain persons,) are
declared for such, by those whom God hath authorised to declare them. But this
Authority of man to declare what be these Positive Lawes of God, how can it be
known? God may command a man by a supernaturall way, to deliver Lawes to other
men. But because it is of the essence of Law, that he who is to be obliged, be
assured of the Authority of him that declareth it, which we cannot naturally
take notice to be from God, _How can a man without supernaturall Revelation be
assured of the Revelation received by the declarer_? and _how can he be bound to
obey them?_ For the first question, how a man can be assured of the Revelation
of another, without a Revelation particularly to himselfe, it is evidently
impossible: For though a man may be induced to believe such Revelation, from the
Miracles they see him doe, or from seeing the Extraordinary sanctity of his
life, or from seeing the Extraordinary wisedome, or Extraordinary felicity of
his Actions, all which are marks of God[s] extraordinary favour; yet they are
not assured evidences of speciall Revelation. Miracles are Marvellous workes:
but that which is marvellous to one, may not be so to another. Sanctity may be
feigned; and the visible felicities of this world, are most often the work of
God by Naturall, and ordinary causes. And therefore no man can infallibly know
by naturall reason, that another has had a supernaturall revelation of Gods
will; but only a beliefe; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear greater,
or lesser) a firmer, or a weaker belief.

{#40} But for the second, how he can be bound to obey them; it is not so hard.
For if the Law declared, be not against the Law of Nature (which is undoubtedly
Gods Law) and he undertake to obey it, he is bound by his own act; bound I say
to obey it, but not bound to believe it: for mens beliefe, and interiour
cogitations, are not subject to the commands, but only to the operation of God,
ordinary, or extraordinary. Faith of Supernaturall Law, is not a fulfilling, but
only an assenting to the same; and not a duty that we exhibite to God, but a
gift which God freely giveth to whom he pleaseth; as also Unbelief is not a
breach of any of his Lawes; but a rejection of them all, except the Laws
Naturall. But this that I say, will be made yet cleerer, by the Examples, and
Testimonies concerning this point in holy Scripture. The Covenant God made with
_Abraham_ (in a Supernaturall manner) was thus, _This is the Covenant which thou
shalt_#_Gen.17.10._# _observe between Me and Thee and thy Seed after thee.
Abrahams_ Seed had not this revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a
party to the Covenant, and bound to obey what _Abraham_ should declare to them
for Gods Law; which they could not be, but in vertue of the obedience they owed
to their Parents; who (if they be Subject to no other earthly power, as here in
the case of _Abraham_) have Soveraign power over their children, and servants.
Againe, where God saith to _Abraham, In thee shall all Nations of the earth be
blessed: For I know thou wilt command thy children, and thy house after thee to
keep the way of the Lord, and to observe Righteousnesse and Judgement_, it is
manifest, the obedience of his Family, who had no Revelation, depended on their
former obligation to obey their Soveraign. At Mount _Sinai Moses_ only went up
to God; the people were forbidden to approach on paine of death; yet were they
bound to obey all that _Moses_ declared to them for Gods Law. Upon what ground,
but on this submission of their own, _Speak thou to us, and we will heare thee;
but let not God speak to us, lest we dye?_ By which two places it sufficiently
appeareth, that in a Common-wealth, a subject that has no certain and assured
Revelation particularly to himself concerning the Will of God, is to obey for
such, the Command of the Common-wealth: for if men were at liberty, to take for
Gods Commandements, their own dreams, and fancies, or the dreams and fancies of
private men; scarce two men would agree upon what is Gods Commandement; and yet
in respect of them, every man would despise the Commandements of the
Common-wealth. I conclude therefore, that in all things not contrary to the
Morall Law, (that is to say, to the Law of Nature,) all Subjects are bound to
obey that for divine Law, which is declared to be so, by the Lawes of the
Common-wealth. Which also is evident to any mans reason; for whatsoever is not
against the Law of Nature, may be made Law in the name of them that have the
Soveraign power; and there is no reason men should be the lesse obliged by it,
when tis propounded in the name of God. Besides, there is no place in the world
where men are permitted to pretend other Commandements of God, than are declared
for such by the Common-wealth. Christian States punish those that revolt from
Christian Religion, and all other States, those that set up any Religion by them
forbidden. For in whatsoever is not regulated by the Common-wealth, tis Equity
(which is the Law of Nature, and therefore an eternall Law of God) that every
man equally enjoy his liberty.

{#41} #_Another division of Lawes._# There is also another distinction of Laws,
into _Fundamentall_, and _not Fundamentall_: but I could never see in any
Author, what a Fundamentall Law signifieth. Neverthelesse one may very
reasonably distinguish Laws in that manner.

{#42} #_A Fundamentall Law what._# For a Fundamentall Law in every Common-wealth
is that, which being taken away, the Common-wealth faileth, and is utterly
dissolved; as a building whose Foundation is destroyed. And therefore a
Fundamentall Law is that, by which Subjects are bound to uphold whatsoever power
is given to the Soveraign, whether a Monarch, or a Soveraign Assembly, without
which the Common-wealth cannot stand; such as is the power of War and Peace, of
Judicature, of Election of Officers, and of doing whatsoever he shall think
necessary for the Publique good. Not Fundamentall is that, the abrogating
whereof, draweth not with it the dissolution of the Common-Wealth; such as are
the Lawes concerning Controversies between subject and subject. Thus much of the
Division of Lawes.

{#43} #_Difference between Law and Right:_# I find the words _Lex Civilis_, and
_Jus Civile_, that is to say, _Law_ and _Right Civil_, promiscuously used for
the same thing, even in the most learned Authors; which neverthelesse ought not
to be so. For _Right_ is _Liberty_, namely that Liberty which the Civil Law
leaves us: But _Civill Law_ is an _Obligation_; and takes from us the Liberty
which the Law of Nature gave us. Nature gave a Right to every man to secure
himselfe by his own strength, and to invade a suspected neighbour, by way of
prevention: but the Civill Law takes away that Liberty, in all cases where the
protection of the Law may be safely stayd for. Insomuch as _Lex_ and _Jus_, are
as different as _Obligation_ and _Liberty_.

{#44} Likewise _Lawes_ and _Charters_ are taken promiscuously#_And between a Law
and a Charter._# for the same thing. Yet Charters are Donations of the
Soveraign; and not Lawes, but exemptions from Law. The phrase of a Law is
_Jubeo, Injungo, I command_, and _Enjoyn_: the phrase of a Charter is _Dedi,
Concessi, I have Given, I have Granted_: but what is given or granted, to a man,
is not forced upon him, by a Law. A Law may be made to bind All the Subjects of
a Common-wealth: a Liberty, or Charter is only to One man, or some One part of
the people. For to say all the people of a Common-wealth, have Liberty in any
case whatsoever; is to say, that in such case, there hath been no Law made; or
else having been made, is now abrogated.
