£1 _Of ^Counsell^._ £1

{#1} How fallacious it is to judge of the nature of things,#_Counsell what._# by
the ordinary and inconstant use of words, appeareth in nothing more, than in the
confusion of Counsels, and Commands, arising from the Imperative manner of
speaking in them both, and in many other occasions besides. For the words _Doe
this_, are the words not onely of him that Commandeth; but also of him that
giveth Counsell; and of him that Exhorteth; and yet there are but few, that see
not, that these are very different things; or that cannot distinguish between
them, when they perceive who it is that speaketh, and to whom the Speech is
directed, and upon what occasion. But finding those phrases in mens writings,
and being not able, or not willing to enter into a consideration of the
circumstances, they mistake sometimes the Precepts of Counsellours, for the
Precepts of them that Command; and sometimes the contrary; according as it best
agreeth with the conclusions they would inferre, or the actions they approve. To
avoyd which mistakes, and render to those termes of Commanding, Counselling, and
Exhorting, their proper and distinct significations. I define them thus.

{#2} ^Command^ is where a man saith, _Doe this_, or _Doe not this_,#_Differences
between command, and Counsell._# without expecting other reason than the Will of
him that sayes it. From this it followeth manifestly, that he that Commandeth,
pretendeth thereby his own Benefit: For the reason of his Command is his own |
Will onely, and the proper object of every mans Will, is some Good to himselfe.

{#3} ^Counsell^, is where a man saith, _Doe_, or _Doe not this_, and deduceth
his reasons from the benefit that arriveth by it to him to whom he saith it. And
from this it is evident, that he that giveth Counsell, pretendeth onely
(whatsoever he intendeth) the good of him, to whom he giveth it.

{#4} Therefore between Counsell and Command, one great difference is, that
Command is directed to a mans own benefit; and Counsell to the benefit of
another man. And from this ariseth another difference, that a man may be obliged
to do what he is Commanded; as when he hath covenanted to obey: But he cannot be
obliged to do as he is Counselled, because the hurt of not following it, is his
own; or if he should covenant to follow it, then is the Counsell turned into the
nature of a Command. A third difference between them is, that no man can pretend
a right to be of another mans Counsell; because he is not to pretend benefit by
it to himselfe: but to demand right to Counsell another, argues a will to know
his designes, or to gain some other Good to himselfe; which (as I said before)
is of every mans will the proper object.

{#5} This also is incident to the nature of Counsell; that whatsoever it be, he
that asketh it, cannot in equity accuse, or punish it: For to ask Counsell of
another, is to permit him to give such Counsell as he shall think best; And
consequently, he that giveth counsell to his Soveraign, (whether a Monarch, or
an Assembly) when he asketh it, cannot in equity be punished for it, whether the
same be conformable to the opinion of the most, or not, so it be to the
Proposition in debate. For if the sense of the Assembly can be taken notice of,
before the Debate be ended, they should neither ask, nor take any further
Counsell; For the Sense of the Assembly, is the Resolution of the Debate, and
End of all Deliberation. And generally he that demandeth Counsell, is Author of
it; and therefore cannot punish it; and what the Soveraign cannot, no man else
can. But if one Subject giveth Counsell to another, to do any thing contrary to
the Lawes, whether that Counsell proceed from evill intention, or from ignorance
onely, it is punishable by the Common-wealth; because ignorance of the Law, is
no good excuse, where every man is bound to take notice of the Lawes to which he
is subject.

{#6} ^Exhortation^, and ^Dehortation^, is Counsell, accompanied#_Exhortation and
Dehortation what._# with signes in him that giveth it, of vehement desire to
have it followed; or to say it more briefly, _Counsell vehemently pressed_. For
he that Exhorteth, doth not deduce the consequences of what he adviseth to be
done, and tye himselfe therein to the rigour of true reasoning; but encourages
him he Counselleth, to Action: As he that Dehorteth, deterreth him from it. And
therefore they have in their speeches, a regard to the common Passions, and
opinions of men, in deducing their reasons; and make use of Similitudes,
Metaphors, Examples, and other tooles of Oratory, to perswade their Hearers of
the Utility, Honour, or Justice of following their advise.

{#7} From whence may be inferred, First, that Exhortation and Dehortation, is
directed to the Good of him that giveth the Counsell, not of him that asketh it,
which is contrary to the duty of a Counsellour; who (by the definition of
Counsell) ought to regard, not his own benefit, but his whom he adviseth. And
that he directeth his Counsell to his own benefit, is manifest enough, by the
long and vehement urging, or by the artificiall giving thereof; which being not
required of him, and consequently proceeding from his own occasions, is directed
principally to his own benefit, and but accidentarily to the good of him that is
Counselled, or not at all.

{#8} Secondly, that the use of Exhortation and Dehortation lyeth onely, where a
man is to speak to a Multitude; because when the Speech is addressed to one, he
may interrupt him, and examine his reasons more rigorously, than can be done in
a Multitude; which are too many to enter into Dispute, and Dialogue with him
that speaketh indifferently to them all at once.

{#9} Thirdly, that they that Exhort and Dehort, where they are required to give
Counsell, are corrupt Counsellours, and as it were bribed by their own interest.
For though the Counsell they give be never so good; yet he that gives it, is no
more a good Counsellour, than he that giveth a Just Sentence for a reward, is a
Just Judge. But where a man may lawfully Command, as a Father in his Family, or
a Leader in an Army, his Exhortations and Dehortations, are not onely lawfull,
but also necessary, and laudable: But then they are no more Counsells, but
Commands; which when they are for Execution of soure labour; sometimes
necessity, and alwayes humanity requireth to be sweetned in the delivery, by
encouragement, and in the tune and phrase of Counsell, rather then in harsher
language of Command.

{#10} Examples of the difference between Command and Counsell, we may take from
the formes of Speech that expresse them in Holy Scripture. _Have no other Gods
but me; Make to thy selfe no graven Image; Take not Gods name in vain; Sanctifie
the Sabbath; Honour thy Parents; Kill not; Steale not_, &c. are Commands;
because the reason for which we are to obey them, is drawn from the will of God
our King, whom we are obliged to obey. But these words, _Sell all thou hast;
give it to the poore; and follow me_, are Counsell; because the reason for which
we are to do so, is drawn from our own benefit; which is this, that we shall
have _Treasure in heaven_. These words, _Go into the Village over against you,
and you shall find an Asse tyed, and her Colt; loose her, and bring her to me_,
are a Command: for the reason of their fact is drawn from the will of their
Master: but these words, _Repent, and be Baptized in the Name of Jesus_, are
Counsell; because the reason why we should so do, tendeth not to any benefit of
God Almighty, who shall still be King in what manner soever we rebell; but of
our selves, who have no other means of avoyding the punishment hanging over us
for our sins.

{#11} As the difference of Counsell from Command, hath been now deduced from the
nature of Counsell, consisting in a deducing of the benefit, or hurt that may
arise#_Differences of fit and unfit Counsellours._# to him that is to be
Counselled, by the necessary or probable consequences of the action he
propoundeth; so may also the differences between _apt_, and _inept_ Counsellours
be derived from the same. For Experience, being but Memory of the consequences
of like actions formerly observed, and Counsell but the Speech whereby that
experience is made known to another; the Vertues, and Defects of Counsell, are
the same with the Vertues, and Defects Intellectuall: And to the Person of a
Common-wealth, his Counsellours serve him in the place of Memory, and Mentall
Discourse. But with this resemblance of the Common-wealth, to a naturall man,
there is one dissimilitude joyned, of great importance; which is, that a
naturall man receiveth his experience, from the naturall objects of sense, which
work upon him without passion, or interest of their own; whereas they that give
Counsell to the Representative person of a Common-wealth, may have, and have
often their particular ends, and passions, that render their Counsells alwayes
suspected, and many times unfaithfull. And therefore we may set down for the
first condition of a good Counsellour, _That his Ends, and Interest, be not
inconsistent with the Ends and Interest of him he Counselleth_.

{#12} Secondly, Because the office of a Counsellour, when an action comes into
deliberation, is to make manifest the consequences of it, in such manner, as he
that is Counselled may be truly and evidently informed; he ought to propound his
advise, in such forme of speech, as may make the truth most evidently appear;
that is to say, with as firme ratiocination, as significant and proper language,
and as briefly, as the evidence will permit. And therefore _rash, and unevident
Inferences_; (such as are fetched onely from Examples, or authority of Books,
and are not arguments of what is good, or evill, but witnesses of fact, or of
opinion,) _obscure, confused, and ambiguous Expressions, also all metaphoricall
Speeches, tending to the stirring up of Passion_, (because such reasoning, and
such expressions, are usefull onely to deceive, or to lead him we Counsell
towards other ends than his own) _are repugnant to the Office of a Counsellour_.

{#13} Thirdly, Because the Ability of Counselling proceedeth from Experience,
and long study; and no man is presumed to have experience in all those things
that to the Administration of a great Common-wealth are necessary to be known,
_No man is presumed to be a good Counsellour_, _but in such Businesse, as he
hath not onely been much versed in, but hath also much meditated on, and
considered_. For seeing the businesse of a Common-wealth is this, to preserve
the people in Peace at home, and defend them against forraign Invasion, we shall
find, it requires great knowledge of the disposition of Man-kind, of the Rights
of Government, and of the nature of Equity, Law, Justice, and Honour, not to be
attained without study; And of the Strength, Commodities, Places, both of their
own Country, and their Neighbours; as also of the inclinations, and designes of
all Nations that may any way annoy them. And this is not attained to, without
much experience. Of which things, not onely the whole summe, but every one of
the particulars requires the age, and observation of a man in years, and of more
than ordinary study. The wit required for Counsel, as I have said before (Chap.
8.) is Judgement. And the differences of men in that point come from different
education, of some to one kind of study, or businesse, and of others to another.
When for the doing of any thing, there be Infallible rules, (as in Engines, and
Edifices, the rules of Geometry,) all the experience of the world cannot equal
his Counsell, that has learnt, or found out the Rule. And when there is no such
Rule, he that hath most experience in that particular kind of businesse, has
therein the best Judgement, and is the best Counsellour.

{#14} Fourthly, to be able to give Counsell to a Common-wealth, in a businesse
that hath reference to another Common-wealth, _It is necessary to be acquainted
with the Intelligences, and Letters_ that come from thence, _and with all the
records of Treaties, and other transactions of State_ between them; which none
can doe, but such as the Representative shall think fit. By which we may see,
that they who are not called to Counsell, can have no good Counsell in such
cases to obtrude.

{#15} Fifthly, Supposing the number of Counsellors equall, a man is better
Counselled by hearing them apart, then in an Assembly; and that for many causes.
First, in hearing them apart, you have the advice of every man; but in an
Assembly many of them deliver their advise with _I_, or _No_, or with their
hands, or feet, not moved by their own sense, but by the eloquence of another,
or for feare of displeasing some that have spoken, or the whole Assembly, by
contradiction; or for feare of appearing duller in apprehension, than those that
have applauded the contrary opinion. Secondly, in an Assembly of many, there
cannot choose but be some whose interests are contrary to that of the Publique;
and these their Interests make passionate, and Passion eloquent, and Eloquence
drawes others into the same advice. For the Passions of men, which asunder are
moderate, as the heat of one brand; in Assembly are like many brands, that
enflame one another, (especially when they blow one another with Orations) to
the setting of the Common-wealth on fire, under pretence of Counselling it.
Thirdly, in hearing every man apart, one may examine (when there is need) the
truth, or probability of his reasons, and of the grounds of the advise he gives,
by frequent interruptions, and objections; which cannot be done in an Assembly,
where (in every difficult question) a man is rather astonied, and dazled with
the variety of discourse upon it, than informed of the course he ought to take.
Besides, there cannot be an Assembly of many, called together for advice,
wherein there be not some, that have the ambition to be thought eloquent, and
also learned in the Politiques; and give not their advice with care of the
businesse propounded, but of the applause of their motly orations, made of the
divers colored threds, or shreds of Authors; which is an Impertinence at least,
that takes away the time of serious Consultation, and in the secret way of
Counselling apart, is easily avoided. Fourthly, in Deliberations that ought to
be kept secret, (whereof there be many occasions in Publique Businesse,) the
Counsells of many, and especially in Assemblies, are dangerous; And therefore
great Assemblies are necessitated to commit such affaires to lesser numbers, and
of such persons as are most versed, and in whose fidelity they have most
confidence.

{#16} To conclude, who is there that so far approves the taking of Counsell from
a great Assembly of Counsellours, that wisheth for, or would accept of their
pains, when there is a question of marrying his Children, disposing of his
Lands, governing his Household, or managing his private Estate, especially if
there be amongst them such as wish not his prosperity? A man that doth his
businesse by the help of many and prudent Counsellours, with every one
consulting apart in his proper element, does it best, as he that useth able
Seconds at Tennis play, placed in their proper stations. He does next best, that
useth his own Judgement only; as he that has no Second at all. But he that is
carried up and down to his businesse in a framed Counsell, which cannot move but
by the plurality of consenting opinions, the execution whereof is commonly (out
of envy, or interest) retarded by the part dissenting, does it worst of all, and
like one that is carried to the ball, though by good Players, yet in a
Wheele-barrough, or other frame, heavy of it self, and retarded also by the
inconcurrent judgements, and endeavours of them that drive it; and so much the
more, as they be more that set their hands to it; and most of all, when there is
one, or more amongst them, that desire to have him lose. And though it be true,
that many eys see more then one; yet it is not to be understood of many
Counsellours; but then only, when the finall Resolution is in one man.
Otherwise, because many eyes see the same thing in divers lines, and are apt to
look asquint towards their private benefit; they that desire not to misse their
marke, though they look about with two eyes, yet they never ayme but with one;
And therefore no great Popular Common-wealth was ever kept up; but either by a
forraign Enemy that united them; or by the reputation of some one eminent Man
amongst them; or by the secret Counsell of a few; or by the mutuall feare of
equall factions; and not by the open Consultations of the Assembly. And as for
very little Common-wealths, be they Popular, or Monarchicall, there is no humane
wisdome can uphold them, longer then the Jealousy lasteth of their potent
Neighbours.
