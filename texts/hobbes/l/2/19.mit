£1 _Of the severall Kinds of Common-wealth by Institution, and of Succession to
the Soveraigne Power._ £1

{#1} #_The different Formes of Common-wealths but three._# ^The^ difference of
Common-wealths, consisteth in the difference of the Soveraign, or the Person
representative of all and every one of the Multitude. And because the
Soveraignty is either in one Man, or in an Assembly of more than one; and into
that Assembly either Every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but
Certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest, there can be but Three
kinds of Common-wealth. For the Representative must needs be One man, or More:
and if more, then it is the Assembly of All, or but of a Part. When the
Representative is One man, then is the Common-wealth a ^Monarchy^: when an
Assembly of All that will come together, then it is a ^Democracy^, or Popular
Common-wealth: when an Assembly of a Part onely, then it is called an
^Aristocracy^. Other kind of Common-wealth there can be none: for either One, or
More, or All, must have the Soveraign Power (which I have shewn to be
indivisible) entire.

{#2} #_Tyranny and Oligarchy, but different names of Monarchy, and
Aristocracy._# There be other names of Government, in the Histories, and books
of Policy; as _Tyranny_, and _Oligarchy_: But they are not the names of other
Formes of Government, but of the same Formes misliked. For they that are
discontented under _Monarchy_, call it _Tyranny_; and they that are displeased
with _Aristocracy_, called it _Oligarchy_: So also, they which find themselves
grieved under a _Democracy_, call it _Anarchy_, (which signifies want of
Government;) and yet I think no man believes, that want of Government, is any
new kind of Government: nor by the same reason ought they to believe, that the
Government is of one kind, when they like it, and another, when they mislike it,
or are oppressed by the Governours.

{#3} #_Subordinute Representatives dangerous._# It is manifest, that men who are
in absolute liberty, may, if they please, give Authority to One man, to
represent them every one; as well as give such Authority to any Assembly of men
whatsoever; and consequently may subject themselves, if they think good, to a
Monarch, as absolutely, as to any other Representative. Therefore, where there
is already erected a Soveraign Power, there can be no other Representative of
the same people, but onely to certain particular ends, by the Soveraign limited.
For that were to erect two Soveraigns; and every man to have his person
represented by two Actors, that by opposing one another, must needs divide that
Power, which (if men will live in Peace) is indivisible; and thereby reduce the
Multitude into the condition of Warre, contrary to the end for which all
Soveraignty is instituted. And therefore as it is absurd, to think that a
Soveraign Assembly, inviting the People of their Dominion, to send up their
Deputies, with power to make known their Advise, or Desires, should therefore
hold such Deputies, rather than themselves, for the absolute Representative of
the people: so it is absurd also, to think the same in a Monarchy. And I know
not how this so manifest a truth, should of late be so little observed; that in
a Monarchy, he that had the Soveraignty from a descent of 600 years, was alone
called Soveraign, had the title of Majesty from every one of his Subjects, and
was unquestionably taken by them for their King, was notwithstanding never
considered as their Representative; that name without contradiction passing for
the title of those men, which at his command were sent up by the people to carry
their Petitions, and give him (if he permitted it) their advise. Which may serve
as an admonition, for those that are the true, and absolute Representative of a
People, to instruct men in the nature of that Office, and to take heed how they
admit of any other generall Representation upon any occasion whatsoever, if they
mean to discharge the trust committed to them.

{#4} The difference between these three kindes of Commonwealth,#_Comparison of
Monarchy, with Soveraign Assemblyes._# consisteth not in the difference of
Power; but in the difference of Convenience, or Aptitude to produce the Peace,
and Security of the people; for which end they were instituted. And to compare
Monarchy with the other two, we may observe; First, that whosoever beareth the
Person of the people, or is one of that Assembly that bears it, beareth also his
own naturall Person. And though he be carefull in his politique Person to
procure the common interest; yet he is more, or no lesse carefull to procure the
private good of himselfe, his family, kindred and friends; and for the most
part, if the publique interest chance to crosse the private, he preferrs the
private: for the Passions of men, are commonly more potent than their Reason.
From whence it follows, that where the publique and private interest are most
closely united, there is the publique most advanced. Now in Monarchy, the
private interest is the same with the publique. The riches, power, and honour of
a Monarch arise onely from the riches, strength and reputation of his Subjects.
For no King can be rich, nor glorious, not secure; whose Subjects are either
poore, or contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissention, to maintain a
war against their enemies: Whereas in a Democracy, or Aristocracy, the publique
prosperity conferres not so much to the private fortune of one that is corrupt,
or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a treacherous action, or a
Civill warre.

{#5} Secondly, that a Monarch receiveth counsell of whom, when, and where he
pleaseth; and consequently may heare the opinion of men versed in the matter
about which he deliberates, of what rank or quality soever, and as long before
the time of action, and with as much secrecy, as he will. But when a Soveraigne
Assembly has need of Counsell, none are admitted but such as have a Right
thereto from the beginning; which for the most part are of those who have beene
versed more in the acquisition of Wealth than of Knowledge; and are to give
their advice in long discourses, which may, and do commonly excite men to
action, but not governe them in it. For the _Understanding_ is by the flame of
the Passions, never enlightned, but dazled: Nor is there any place, or time,
wherein an Assemblie can receive Counsell with secrecie, because of their owne
Multitude.

{#6} Thirdly, that the Resolutions of a Monarch, are subject to no other
Inconstancy, than that of Humane Nature; but in Assemblies, besides that of
Nature, there ariseth an Inconstancy from the Number. For the absence of a few,
that would have the Resolution once taken, continue firme, (which may happen by
security, negligence, or private impediments,) or the diligent appearance of a
few of the contrary opinion, undoes to day, all that was concluded yesterday.

{#7} Fourthly, that a Monarch cannot disagree with himselfe, out of envy, or
interest; but an Assembly may; and that to such a height, as may produce a
Civill Warre.

{#8} Fifthly, that in Monarchy there is this inconvenience; that any Subject, by
the power of one man, for the enriching of a favourite or flatterer, may be
deprived of all he possesseth; which I confesse is a great and inevitable
inconvenience. But the same may as well happen, where the Soveraigne Power is in
an Assembly: For their power is the same; and they are as subject to evill
Counsell, and to be seduced by Orators, as a Monarch by Flatterers; and becoming
one an others Flatterers, serve one anothers Covetousnesse and Ambition by
turnes. And whereas the Favorites of Monarchs, are few, and they have none els
to advance but their owne Kindred; the Favorites of an Assembly, are many; and
the Kindred much more numerous, than of any Monarch, Besides, there is no
Favourite of a Monarch, which cannot as well succour his friends, as hurt his
enemies: But Orators, that is to say, Favourites of Soveraigne Assemblies,
though they have great power to hurt, have little to save. For to accuse,
requires lesse Eloquence (such is mans Nature) than to excuse; and condemnation,
than absolution more resembles Justice.

{#9} Sixtly, that it is an inconvenience in Monarchie, that the Soveraigntie may
descend upon an Infant, or one that cannot discerne between Good and Evill: and
consisteth in this, that the use of his Power, must be in the hand of another
Man, or of some Assembly of men, which are to governe by his right, and in his
name; as Curators, and Protectors of his Person, and Authority. But to say there
is inconvenience, in putting the use of the Soveraign Power, into the hand of a
Man, or an Assembly of men; is to say that all Government is more Inconvenient,
than Confusion, and Civill Warre. And therefore all the danger that can be
pretended, must arise from the Contention of those, that for an office of so
great honour, and profit, may become Competitors. To make it appear, that this
inconvenience, proceedeth not from that forme of Government we call Monarchy, we
are to consider, that the precedent Monarch, hath appointed who shall have the
Tuition of his Infant Successor, either expressely by Testament, or tacitly, by
not controlling the Custome in that case received: And then such inconvenience
(if it happen) is to be attributed, not to the Monarchy, but to the Ambition,
and Injustice of the Subjects; which in all kinds of Government, where the
people are not well instructed in their Duty, and the Rights of Soveraignty, is
the same. Or else the precedent Monarch, hath not at all taken order for such
Tuition; And then the Law of Nature hath provided this sufficient rule, That the
Tuition shall be in him, that hath by Nature most interest in the preservation
of the Authority of the Infant, and to whom least benefit can accrue by his
death, or diminution. For seeing every man by nature seeketh his own benefit,
and promotion; to put an Infant into the power of those, that can promote
themselves by his destruction, or dammage, is not Tuition, but Trechery. So that
sufficient provision being taken, against all just quarrell, about the
Government under a Child, if any contention arise to the disturbance of the
publique Peace, it is not to be attributed to the forme of Monarchy, but to the
ambition of Subjects, and ignorance of their Duty. On the other side, there is
no great Common-wealth, the Soveraignty whereof is in a great Assembly, which is
not, as to consultations of peace, and Warre, and making of Lawes, in the same
condition, as if the Government were in a Child. For as a Child wants the
judgement to dissent from counsell given him, and is thereby necessitated to
take the advise of them, or him, to whom he is committed: So an Assembly wanteth
the liberty, to dissent from the counsell of the major part, be it good, or bad.
And as a Child has need of a Tutor, or Protector, to preserve his Person, and
Authority: So also (in great Common-wealths,) the Soveraign Assembly, in all
great dangers and troubles, have need of _Custodes libertatis_; that is of
Dictators, or Protectors of their Authoritie; which are as much as Temporary
Monarchs; to whom for a time, they may commit the entire exercise of their
Power; and have (at the end of that time) been oftner deprived thereof, than
Infant Kings, by their Protectors, Regents, or any other Tutors.

{#10} Though the Kinds of Soveraigntie be, as I have now shewn, but three; that
is to say, Monarchie, where One Man has it; or Democracie, where the generall
Assembly of Subjects hath it; or Aristocracie, where it is in an Assembly of
certain persons nominated, or otherwise distinguished from the rest: Yet he that
shall consider the particular Common-wealthes that have been, and are in the
world, will not perhaps easily reduce them to three, and may thereby be inclined
to think there be other Formes, arising from these mingled together. As for
example, Elective Kingdomes; where Kings have the Soveraigne Power put into
their hands for a time; or Kingdomes, wherein the King hath a power limited:
which Governments, are nevertheles by most Writers called Monarchie. Likewise if
a Popular, or Aristocraticall Common-wealth, subdue an Enemies Countrie, and
govern the same, by a President, Procurator, or other Magistrate; this may seeme
perhaps at first sight, to be a Democraticall, or Aristocraticall Government.
But it is not so. For Elective Kings, are not Soveraignes, but Ministers of the
Soveraigne; nor limited Kings Soveraignes, but Ministers of them that have the
Soveraigne Power: Nor are those Provinces which are in subjection to a
Democracie, or Aristocracie of another Common-wealth, Democratically, or
Aristocratically governed, but Monarchically.

{#11} And first, concerning an Elective King, whose power is limited to his
life, as it is in many places of Christen-dome at this day; or to certaine
Yeares or Moneths, as the Dictators power amongst the Romans; If he have Right
to appoint his Successor, he is no more Elective but Hereditary. But if he have
no Power to elect his Successor, then there is some other Man, or Assembly
known, which after his decease may elect a new, or else the Common-wealth dieth,
and dissolveth with him, and returneth to the condition of Warre. If it be known
who have the power to give the Soveraigntie after his death, it is known also
that the Soveraigntie was in them before: For none have right to give that which
they have not right to possesse, and keep to themselves, if they think good. But
if there be none that can give the Soveraigntie, after the decease of him that
was first elected: then has he power, nay he is obliged by the Law of Nature, to
provide, by establishing his Successor, to keep those that had trusted him with
the Government, from relapsing into the miserable condition of Civill warre. And
consequently he was, when elected, a Soveraign absolute.

{#12} Secondly, that King whose power is limited, is not superiour to him, or
them that have the power to limit it; and he that is not superiour, is not
supreme; that is to say not Soveraign. The Soveraignty therefore was alwaies in
that Assembly which had the Right to Limit him; and by consequence the
government not Monarchy, but either Democracy, or Aristocracy; as of old time in
_Sparta_; where the Kings had a priviledge to lead their Armies; but the
Soveraignty was in the _Ephori_.

{#13} Thirdly, whereas heretofore the Roman People, governed the land of _Judea_
(for example) by a President; yet was not _Judea_ therefore a Democracy; because
they were not governed by any Assembly, into the which, any of them, had right
to enter; nor by an Aristocracy; because they were not governed by any Assembly,
into which, any man could enter by their Election: but they were governed by one
Person, which though as to the people of _Rome_ was an Assembly of the people,
or Democracy; yet as to people of _Judea_, which had no right at all of
participating in the government, was a Monarch. For though where the people are
governed by an Assembly, chosen by themselves out of their own number, the
government is called a Democracy, or Aristocracy; yet when they are governed by
an Assembly, not of their own choosing, tis a Monarchy; not of _One_ man, over
another man; but of one people, over another people.

{#14} Of all these Formes of Government, the matter being#_Of the Right of
Succession._# mortall, so that not onely Monarchs, but also whole Assemblies dy,
it is necessary for the conservation of the peace of men, that as there was
order taken for an Artificiall Man, so there be order also taken, for an
Artificiall Eternity of life; without which, men that are governed by an
Assembly, should return into the condition of Warre in every age; and they that
are governed by One man, assoon as their Governour dyeth. This Artificiall
Eternity, is that which men call the Right of _Succession_.

{#15} There is no perfect forme of Government, where the disposing of the
Succession is not in the present Soveraign. For if it be in any other particular
Man, or private Assembly, it is in a person subject, and may be assumed by the
Soveraign at his pleasure; and consequently the Right is in himselfe. And if it
be in no particular man, but left to a new choyce; then is the Common-wealth
dissolved; and the Right is in him that can get it; contrary to the intention of
them that did Institute the Common-wealth, for their perpetuall, and not
temporary security.

{#16} In a Democracy, the whole Assembly cannot faile, unlesse the Multitude
that are to be governed faile. And therefore questions of the right of
Succession, have in that forme of Government no place at all.

{#17} In an Aristocracy, when any of the Assembly dyeth, the election of another
into his room belongeth to the Assembly, as the Soveraign, to whom belongeth the
choosing of all Counsellours, and Officers. For that which the Representative
doth, as Actor, every one of the Subjects doth, as Author. And though the
Soveraign Assembly, may give Power to others, to elect new men, for supply of
their court; yet it is still by their Authority, that the Election is made; and
by the same it may (when the publique shall require it) be recalled.

{#18} The greatest difficultie about the right of Succession, is in Monarchy:
And the difficulty ariseth from this,#_The present Monarch hath Right to dispose
of the Succession._# that at first sight, it is not manifest who is to appoint
the Successor; nor many times, who it is whom he hath appointed. For in both
these cases, there is required a more exact ratiocination, than every man is
accustomed to use. As to the question, who shall appoint the Successor, of a
Monarch that hath the Soveraign Authority; that is to say, who shall determine
of the right of Inheritance, (for Elective Kings and Princes have not the
Soveraign Power in propriety, but in use only,) we are to consider, that either
he that is in possession, has right to dispose of the Succession, or else that
right is again in the dissolved Multitude. For the death of him that hath the
Soveraign power in propriety, leaves the Multitude without any Soveraign at all;
that is, without any Representative in whom they should be united, and be
capable of doing any one action at all: And therefore they are incapable of
Election of any new Monarch; every man having equall right to submit himselfe to
such as he thinks best able to protect him; or if he can, protect himselfe by
his owne sword, which is a returne to Confusion, and to the condition of a War
of every man against every man, contrary to the end for which Monarchy had its
first Institution. Therfore it is manifest, that by the Institution of Monarchy,
the disposing of the Successor, is alwaies left to the Judgment and Will of the
present Possessor.

{#19} And for the question (which may arise sometimes) who it is that the
Monarch in possession, hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his
power; it is determined by his expresse Words, and Testament; or by other tacite
signes sufficient.

{#20} #_Succession passeth by expresse Words;_# By expresse Words, or Testament,
when it is declared by him in his life time, _viva voce_, or by Writing; as the
first Emperours of _Rome_ declared who should be their Heires. For the word
Heire does not of it selfe imply the Children, or nearest Kindred of a man; but
whomsoever a man shall any way declare, he would have to succeed him in his
Estate. If therefore a Monarch declare expresly, that such a man shall be his
Heire, either by Word or Writing, then is that man immediatly after the decease
of his Predecessor, Invested in the right of being Monarch.

{#21} #_Or, by not controlling a Custome_:# But where Testament, and expresse
Words are wanting, other naturall signes of the Will are to be followed: whereof
the one is Custome. And therefore where the Custome is, that the next of Kindred
absolutely succeedeth, there also the next of Kindred hath right to the
Succession; for that, if the will of him that was in posession had been
otherwise, he might easily have declared the same in his life time. And likewise
where the Custome is, that the next of the Male Kindred succeedeth, there also
the right of Succession is in the next of the Kindred Male, for the same reason.
And so it is if the Custome were to advance the Female. For what-soever Custome
a man may by a word controule, and does not, it is a naturall signe he would
have that Custome stand.

{#22} #_Or, by presumption of naturall affection._# But where neither Custome,
nor Testament hath preceded, there it is to be understood, First, that a
Monarchs will is, that the government remain Monarchicall; because. he hath
approved that government in himselfe. Secondly, that a Child of his own, Male,
or Female, be preferred before any other; because men are presumed to be more
enclined by nature, to advance their own children, than the children of other
men; and of their own, rather a Male than a Female; because men, are naturally
fitter than women, for actions of labour and danger. Thirdly, where his own
Issue faileth, rather a Brother than a stranger; and so still the neerer in
bloud, rather than the more remote; because it is alwayes presumed that the
neerer of kin, is the neerer in affection; and 'tis evident that a man receives
alwayes, by reflexion, the most honour from the greatnesse of his neerest
kindred.

{#23} But if it be lawfull for a Monarch to dispose of the#_To dispose of the
Succession, though to a King of another Nation, not un-lawfull._# Succession by
words of Contract, or Testament, men may perhaps object a great inconvenience:
for he may sell, or give his Right of governing to a stranger; which, because
strangers (that is, men not used to live under the same government, nor speaking
the same language) do commonly undervalue one another, may turn to the
oppression of his Subjects; which is indeed a great inconvenience: but it
proceedeth not necessarily from the subjection to a strangers government, but
from the unskilfulnesse of the Governours, ignorant of the true rules of
Politiques. And therefore the Romans when they had subdued many Nations, to make
their Government digestible, were wont to take away that grievance, as much as
they thought necessary, by giving sometimes to whole Nations, and sometimes to
Principall men of every Nation they conquered, not onely the Privileges, but
also the Name of Romans; and took many of them into the Senate, and Offices of
charge, even in the Roman City. And this was it our most wise King, King
_James_, aymed at, in endeavouring the Union of his two Realms of _England_ and
_Scotland_. Which if he could have obtained, had in all likelihood prevented the
Civill warres, which make both those Kingdomes, at this present, miserable. It
is not therefore any injury to the people, for a Monarch to dispose of the
Succession by Will; though by the fault of many Princes, it hath been sometimes
found inconvenient. Of the lawfulnesse of it, this also is an argument, that
whatsoever inconvenience can arrive by giving a Kingdome to a stranger, may
arrive also by so marrying with strangers, as the Right of Succession may
descend upon them: yet this by all men is accounted lawfull.
