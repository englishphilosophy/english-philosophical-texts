£1 _Of the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a ^Common-Wealth^._ £1

{#1} #_The End of Common-wealth, particular Security:_# ^The^ finall Cause, End,
or Designe of men, (who naturally love Liberty, and Dominion over others,) in
the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, (in which wee see them live
in Common-wealths,) is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more
contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that
miserable condition of Warre, which is#_Chap. 13._# necessarily consequent (as
hath been shewn) to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power
to keep them in awe, and tye them by feare of punishment to the performance of
their Covenants, and observation of those Lawes of Nature set down in the
fourteenth and fifteenth Chapters.

{#2} #_Which is not to be had from the Law of Nature:_# For the Lawes of Nature
(as _Justice, Equity, Modesty, Mercy_, and (in summe) _doing to others, as wee
would be done to_,) of themselves, without the terrour of some Power, to cause
them to be observed, are contrary to our naturall Passions, that carry us to
Partiality, Pride, Revenge, and the like. And Covenants, without the Sword, are
but Words, and of no strength to secure a man at all. Therefore notwithstanding
the Lawes of Nature, (which every one hath then kept, when he has the will to
keep them, when he can do it safely,) if there be no Power erected, or not great
enough for our security; every man will, and may lawfully rely on his own
strength and art, for caution against all other men. And in all places, where
men have lived by small Families, to robbe and spoyle one another, has been a
Trade, and so farre from being reputed against the Law of Nature, that the
greater spoyles they gained, the greater was their honour; and men observed no
other Lawes therein, but the Lawes of Honour; that is, to abstain from cruelty,
leaving to men their lives, and instruments of husbandry. And as small Familyes
did then; so now do Cities and Kingdomes which are but greater Families (for
their own security) enlarge their Dominions, upon all pretences of danger, and
fear of Invasion, or assistance that may be given to Invaders, endeavour as much
as they can, to subdue, or weaken their neighbours, by open force, and secret
arts, for want of other Caution, justly; and are remembred for it in after ages
with honour.

{#3} Nor is it the joyning together of a small number of#_Nor from the
conjunction of a few men or familyes:_# men, that gives them this security;
because in small numbers, small additions on the one side or the other, make the
advantage of strength so great, as is sufficient to carry the Victory; and
therefore gives encouragement to an Invasion. The Multitude sufficient to
confide in for our Security, is not determined by any certain number, but by
comparison with the Enemy we feare; and is then sufficient, when the odds of the
Enemy is not of so visible and conspicuous moment, to determine the event of
warre, as to move him to attempt.

{#4} And be there never so great a Multitude; yet if#_Nor from a great
Multitude, unlesse directed by one judgement:_# their actions be directed
according to their particular judgements, and particular appetites, they can
expect thereby no defence, nor protection, neither against a Common enemy, nor
against the injuries of one another. For being distracted in opinions concerning
the best use and application of their strength, they do not help, but hinder one
another; and reduce their strength by mutuall opposition to nothing: whereby
they are easily, not onely subdued by a very few that agree together; but also
when there is no common enemy, they make warre upon each other, for their
particular interests. For if we could suppose a great Multitude of men to
consent in the observation of Justice, and other Lawes of Nature, without a
common Power to keep them all in awe; we might as well suppose all Man-kind to
do the same; and then there neither would be, nor need to be any Civill
Government, or Common-wealth at all; because there would be Peace without
subjection.

{#5} #_And that continually._# Nor is it enough for the security, which men
desire should last all the time of their life, that they be governed, and
directed by one judgement, for a limited time; as in one Battell, or one Warre.
For though they obtain a Victory by their unanimous endeavour against a forraign
enemy; yet afterwards, when either they have no common enemy, or he that by one
part is held for an enemy, is by another part held for a friend, they must needs
by the difference of their interests dissolve, and fall again into a Warre
amongst themselves.

{#6} #_Why certain creatures without reason, or speech, do neverthelesse live in
Society, without any coërcive Power._# It is true, that certain living
creatures, as Bees, and Ants, live sociably one with another, (which are
therefore by _Aristotle_ numbred amongst Politicall creatures;) and yet have no
other direction, than their particular judgements and appetites; nor speech,
whereby one of them can signifie to another, what he thinks expedient for the
common benefit: and therefore some man may perhaps desire to know, why Man-kind
cannot do the same. To which I answer,

{#7} First, that men are continually in competition for Honour and Dignity,
which these creatures are not; and consequently amongst men there ariseth on
that ground, Envy and Hatred, and finally Warre; but amongst these not so.

{#8} Secondly, that amongst these creatures, the Common good differeth not from
the Private; and being by nature enclined to their private, they procure thereby
the common benefit. But man, whose Joy consisteth in comparing himselfe with
other men, can relish nothing but what is eminent.

{#9} Thirdly, that these creatures, having not (as man) the use of reason, do
not see, nor think they see any fault, in the administration of their common
businesse: whereas amongst men, there are very many, that thinke themselves
wiser, and abler to govern the Publique, better than the rest; and these strive
to reforme and innovate, one this way, another that way; and thereby bring it
into Distraction and Civill warre.

{#10} Fourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice, in
making knowne to one another their desires, and other affections; yet they want
that art of words, by which some men can represent to others, that which is
Good, in the likenesse of Evill; and Evill, in the likenesse of Good; and
augment, or diminish the apparent greatnesse of Good and Evill; discontenting
men, and troubling their Peace at their pleasure.

{#11} Fiftly, irrationall creatures cannot distinguish betweene _Injury_, and
_Dammage_; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended with
their fellowes: whereas Man is then most troublesome, when he is most at ease:
for then it is that he loves to shew his Wisdome, and controule the Actions of
them that governe the Common-wealth.

{#12} Lastly, the agreement of these creatures is Naturall; that of men, is by
Covenant only, which is Artificiall: and therefore it is no wonder if there be
somwhat else required (besides Covenant) to make their Agreement constant and
lasting; which is a Common Power, to keep them in awe, and to direct their
actions to the Common Benefit.

{#13} The only way to erect such a Common Power, as may#_The Generation of a
Commonwealth._# be able to defend them from the invasion of Forraigners, and the
injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them in such sort, as that by
their owne industrie, and by the fruites of the Earth, they may nourish
themselves and live contentedly; is, to conferre all their power and strength
upon one Man, or upon one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills, by
plurality of voices, unto one Will: which is as much as to say, to appoint one
Man, or Assembly of men, to beare their Person; and every one to owne, and
acknowledge himselfe to be Author of whatsoever he that so beareth their Person,
shall Act, or cause to be Acted, in those things which concerne the Common Peace
and Safetie; and therein to submit their Wills, every one to his Will, and their
Judgements, to his Judgment. This is more than Consent, or Concord; it is a
reall Unitie of them all, in one and the same Person, made by Covenant of every
man with every man, in such manner, as if every man should say to every man, _I
Authorise and give up my Right of Governing my selfe, to this Man, or to this
Assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy Right to him, and
Authorise all his Actions in like manner_. This done, the Multitude so united in
one Person, is called a ^Common-wealth^, in latine ^Civitas^. This is the
Generation of that great ^Leviathan^, or rather (to speake more reverently) of
that _Mortall God_, to which wee owe under the _Immortall God_, our peace and
defence. For by this Authoritie, given him by every particular man in the
Common-Wealth, he hath the use of so much Power and Strength conferred on him,
that by terror thereof, he is inabled to forme the wills of them all, to Peace
at home, and mutuall ayd against their enemies abroad. And in him consisteth the
Essence of the#_The Definition of a Commonwealth._# Common-wealth; which (to
define it,) is _One Person, of whose Acts a great Multitude, by mutuall
Covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the Author, to the
end he may use the strength and means of them all, as he shall think expedient,
for their Peace and Common Defence_.

{#14} #_Soveraigne, and Subject, what._# And he that carryeth this Person, is
called ^Soveraigne^, and said to have _Soveraigne Power_; and every one besides,
his ^Subject^.

{#15} The attaining to this Soveraigne Power, is by two wayes. One, by Naturall
force; as when a man maketh his children, to submit themselves, and their
children to his government, as being able to destroy them if they refuse; or by
Warre subdueth his enemies to his will, giving them their lives on that
condition. The other, is when men agree amongst themselves, to submit to some
Man, or Assembly of men, voluntarily, on confidence to be protected by him
against all others. This later, may be called a Politicall Common-wealth, or
Common-wealth by _Institution_; and the former, a Common-wealth by
_Acquisition_. And first, I shall speak of a Common-wealth by Institution.
