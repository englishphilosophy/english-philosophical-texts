£1 The Second Dialogue, between Horatio and Cleomenes £1

{#1} THE Discourse we had Yesterday, has made a great Impression upon me; you
said several Things, that were very entertaining, and some which I shall not
easily forget: I don't remember, I ever look'd into myself so much as I have
done since last Night after I left you.

{#2} To do that faithfully, is a more difficult and a severer Task, than is
commonly imagin'd. When Yesterday I ask'd you, where and among what sort of
People we were to look for those, whom you would allow to act from Principles of
Virtue, you named a Class, among whom I have found very agreeable Characters of
Men, that yet all have their Failings: If these could be left out, and the best
were pick'd and cull'd from the different good Qualities that are to be seen in
several, the Compound would make a very handsome Picture.

{#3} To finish it well every way would be a great Master-piece.

{#4} That I shan't attempt: But I don't think it would be very difficult to make
a little Sketch of it, that yet should exceed Nature, and be a better Pattern
for Imitation than any can be shewn alive. I have a Mind to try: the very
Thought enlivens me. How charming is the Portrait of a complete Gentleman, and
how ravishing is the Figure which a Person of great Birth and Fortune, to whom
Nature has been no Niggard, makes, when he understands the World, and is
throughly well bred!

{#5} I think them so, I can assure you, whether you are in Jest or in Earnest.

{#6} How entirely well hid are his greatest Imperfections! Tho' Money is his
Idol, and he is covetous in his Heart, yet his inward Avarice is forc'd to give
way to his outward Liberality, and an open Generosity shines through all his
Actions.

{#7} There lies your Fault: It is this I cannot endure in you.

{#8} What's the matter?

{#9} I know what you are about, you are going to give me the _Caricatura_ of a
Gentleman, under pretence of drawing his Portrait.

{#10} You wrong me, I have no such Thought.

{#11} But why is it impossible for Human Nature ever to be good? Instead of
leaving out, you put in Failings without the least Grounds or Colour. When
Things have a handsome Appearance every way, what Reason have you to suspect
them still to be bad? How came you to know, and which way have you discover'd,
Imperfections that are entirely well hid; and why should you suppose a Person to
be covetous in his Heart, and that Money is his Idol, when you own yourself that
he never shews it, and that an open Generosity shines through all his Actions?
This is monstrous.

{#12} I have made no such Supposition of any Man, and I protest to you, that, in
what I said, I had no other Meaning than to observe, that whatever Frailties and
natural Infirmities Persons might be conscious of within, good Sense and good
Manners were capable, and, without any other Assistance, sufficient to keep them
out of Sight: But your Questions are very seasonable, and since you have started
this, I will be very open to you, and acquaint you before-hand with my Design of
the Description I am going to make; and the Use I intend it for; which in short
is, to demonstrate to you, That a most beautiful Superstructure may be rais'd
upon a rotten and despicable Foundation. You'll understand me better presently.

{#13} But how do you know a Foundation to be rotten that supports the Building,
and is wholly conceal'd from you?

{#14} Have Patience, and I promise you, that I shall take nothing for granted,
which you shall not allow of yourself.

{#15} Stick close to that, and I desire no more: Now say what you will.

{#16} The true Object of Pride or Vain-glory is the Opinion of others; and the
most superlative Wish, which a Man possess'd, and entirely fill'd with it can
make, is, that he may be well thought of, applauded, and admired by the whole
World, not only in the present, but all future Ages. This Passion is generally
exploded, but it is incredible, how many strange and widely different Miracles
are and may be perform'd by the force of it; as Persons differ in Circumstances
and Inclinations. In the first place, there is no Danger so great, but by the
help of his Pride a Man may slight and confront it; nor any manner of Death so
terrible, but with the same Assistance, he may court, and if he has a firm
Constitution, undergo it with Alacrity. In the second, there are no good Offices
or Duties, either to others or ourselves, that _Cicero_ has spoke of, nor any
Instances of Benevolence, Humanity, or other Social Virtue, that Lord
_Shaftsbury_ has hinted at, but a Man of good Sense and Knowledge may learn to
practise them from no better Principle than Vain-glory, if it be strong enough
to subdue and keep under all other Passions, that may thwart and interfere with
his Design.

{#17} Shall I allow all this?

{#18} Yes.

{#19} When?

{#20} Before we part.

{#21} Very well.

{#22} Men of tolerable Parts in plentiful Circumstances, that were artfully
educated, and are not singular in their Temper, can hardly fail of a genteel
Behaviour: The more Pride they have and the greater Value they set on the Esteem
of others, the more they'll make it their Study, to render themselves acceptable
to all they converse with; and they'll take uncommon Pains to conceal and stifle
in their Bosoms every thing, which their good Sense tells them ought not to be
seen or understood.

{#23} I must interrupt you, and cannot suffer you to go on thus. What is all
this but the old Story over again, that every Thing is Pride, and all we see,
Hypocrisy, without Proof or Argument? Nothing in the World is more false, than
what you have advanced now; for according to that, the most noble, the most
gallant, and the best-bred Man would be the proudest; which is so clashing with
daily experience, that the very reverse is true. Pride and Insolence are no
where more common than among Upstarts; Men of no Family, that raise Estates out
of nothing, and the most ordinary People, that having had no Education, are
puff'd up with their Fortune, whenever they are lifted up above Mediocrity, and
from mean Stations advanced to Posts of Honour: Whereas no Men upon Earth,
generally speaking, are more Courteous, Humane, or Polite than Persons of high
Birth, that enjoy the large Possessions, and known Seats of their Ancestors; Men
illustrious by Descent, that have been used to Grandeur and Titles of Honour
from their Infancy, and receiv'd an Education suitable to their Quality. I don't
believe there ever was a Nation, that were not Savages, in which the Youth of
both Sexes were not expressly taught never to be Proud or Haughty: Did you ever
know a School, a Tutor, or a Parent, that did not continually inculcate to those
under their Care to be civil and obliging; nay, does not the word _Mannerly_
itself import as much?

{#24} I beg of you let us be calm, and speak with exactness. The Doctrine of
good Manners furnishes us with a thousand Lessons against the various
Appearances and outward Symptoms of Pride, but it has not one Precept against
the Passion it self.

{#25} How is that?

{#26} No, not one against the Passion it self; the Conquest of it is never
attempted, nor talk'd of in a Gentleman's Education, where Men are to be
continually inspired and kept warm with the Sense of their Honour, and the
inward Value they must put upon themselves on all Emergencies.

{#27} This is worth Consideration, and requires time to be examin'd into; but
where is your fine Gentleman, the Picture you promis'd?

{#28} I am ready, and shall begin with his Dwelling: Tho' he has several noble
Seats in different Counties, yet I shall only take notice of his chief
Mansion-house, that bears the Name, and does the Honours of the Family: this is
amply Magnificent, and yet Commodious to Admiration. His Gardens are very
extensive, and contain an infinite variety of pleasing Objects: they are divided
into many Branches for divers Purposes, and every where fill'd with Improvements
of Art upon Nature; yet a beautiful Order and happy Contrivance are conspicuous
through every Part; and tho' nothing is omitted to render them Stately and
Delightful; the whole is laid out to the best Advantage. Within Doors every
Thing bespeaks the Grandeur and Judgment of the Master; and as no Cost is spared
any where to procure Beauty or Conveniency, so you see none impertinently
lavish'd. All his Plate and Furniture are completely fine, and you see nothing
but what is fashionable. He has no Pictures but of the most eminent Hands: The
Rarities he shews are really such; he hoards up no Trifles, nor offers any thing
to your Sight that is shocking: But the several Collections he has of this sort
are agreeable as well as extraordinary, and rather valuable than large: But
Curiosities and Wealth are not confin'd to his Cabinet; the Marble and Sculpture
that are display'd up and down are a Treasure themselves; and there is abundance
of admirable Gilding and excellent Carving to be seen in many Places. What has
been laid out on the great Hall and one Gallery would be a considerable Estate;
and there is a Salloon and a Staircase not inferior to either: These are all
very spacious and lofty; the Architecture of them is of the best Taste, and the
Decorations surprising. Throughout the whole there appears a delicate mixture
and astonishing Variety of lively Embellishments, the Splendor of which, join'd
to a perfect Cleanliness, no where neglected, are highly entertaining to the
most careless and least observng Eye; whilst the Exactness of the Workmanship
bestow'd on every Part of the meanest Utensil, gives a more solid Satisfaction,
and is ravishing to the Curious. But the greatest Excellency in this Model of
Perfection is this; that as in the most ordinary Rooms there is nothing wanting
for their Purpose, and the least Passage is handsomly finish'd; so in those of
the greatest _Eclat_ there is nothing overcharg'd, nor any Part of them
incumbred with Ornaments.

{#29} This is a study'd Piece; but I don't like it the worse for it, pray go on.

{#30} I have thought of it before, I own. His Equipage is rich and well chosen,
and there is nothing to be seen about him that Art or Expence, within the
Compass of Reason, could make better. At his own Table his Looks are ever
Jovial, and his Heart seems to be as open as his Countenance. His chief Business
there is to take care of others without being troublesome, and all his Happiness
seems to consist in being able to please his Friends: In his greatest Mirth he
is wanting in Respect to no Man, and never makes use of Abbreviations in Names,
or unhandsome Familiarities with the meanest of his Guests. To every one that
speaks to him he gives an obliging Attention, and seems never to disregard any
Thing but what is said in Commendation of his Fare: He never interrupts any
Discourse but what is made in his Praise, and seldom assents to any Encomiums,
tho' the most equitable, that are made on any thing that is His. When he is
abroad he never spies Faults, and whatever is amiss, he either says nothing; or,
in answer to the Complaints and Uneasiness of others, gives every thing the
best-natur'd turn it can bear; but he seldom leaves a House before he finds out
something to extoll in it without wronging his Judgment. His Conversation is
always facetious and good-humour'd, but as solid as it is diverting. He never
utters a Syllable that has the least Tincture of Obscenity or Prophaneness; nor
ever made a Jest that was offensive.

{#31} Very fine!

{#32} He seems to be entirely free from Bigotry and Superstition, avoids all
Disputes about Religion; but goes constantly to Church, and is seldom absent
from his Family-Devotions.

{#33} A very godly Gentleman!

{#34} I expected we should differ there.

{#35} I don't find fault. Proceed, pray.

{#36} As he is a Man of Erudition himself, so he is a Promoter of Arts and
Sciences; he is a Friend to Merit, a Rewarder of Industry, and a profess'd Enemy
to nothing but Immorality and Oppression. Tho' no Man's Table is better
furnish'd, nor Cellars better stored; he is temperate in his Eating, and never
commits excess in Drinking: Tho' he has an exquisite Palate, he always prefers
wholesome Meats to those that are delicious only, and never indulges his
Appetite in any thing that might probably be prejudicial to his Health.

{#37} Admirably good!

{#38} As he is in all other Things, so he is elegant in his Cloaths, and has
often new ones: Neatness he prefers to Finery in his own Dress, but his Retinue
is rich. He seldom wears Gold or Silver himself, but on very solemn Occasions,
in Compliment to others; and to demonstrate that these pompous Habits are made
for no other purpose, he is never seen twice in the same; but having appear'd in
them one day, he gives them away the next. Tho' of every thing he has the best
of the sort, and might be call'd curious in Apparel; yet he leaves the Care of
it to others; and no Man has his Cloaths put on better that seems so little to
regard them.

{#39} Perfectly right; to be well dress'd is a necessary Article, and yet to be
sollicitous about it is below a Person of Quality.

{#40} Therefore he has a Domestick of good Taste, a judicious Man, who saves him
that trouble, and the Management likewise of his Lace and Linnen is the Province
of a skilful Woman. His Language is courtly, but natural and intelligible; it is
neither low nor bombastick, and ever free from pedantick and vulgar Expressions.
All his Motions are Genteel without Affectation; his Mein is rather Sedate than
Airy, and his Manner Noble: for tho' he is ever Civil and Condescending, and no
Man less Arrogant, yet in all his Carriage there is something gracefully
Majestick; and as there is nothing mean in his Humility, so his Loftiness has
nothing disobliging.

{#41} Prodigiously good!

{#42} He is charitable to the Poor, his House is never shut to Strangers, and
all his Neighbours he counts to be his Friends. He is a Father to his Tenants,
and looks upon their Welfare as inseparable from his Interest. No Man is less
uneasy at little Offences, or more ready to forgive all Trespasses without
Design. The Injuries that are suffer'd from other Landlords he turns into
Benefits; and whatever Damages, great or small, are sustain'd on his Account,
either from his Diversions or otherwise, he doubly makes good. He takes care to
be early inform'd of such Losses, and commonly repairs them before they are
complain'd of.

{#43} Oh rare Humanity; hearken ye Fox-hunters!

{#44} He never chides any of his People, yet no Man is better serv'd; and tho'
nothing is wanting in his House-keeping, and his Family is very numerous, yet
the Regularity of it is no less remarkable, than the Plenty they live in. His
Orders he will have strictly obey'd, but his Commands are always reasonable, and
he never speaks to the meanest Footman without Regard to Humanity. Extraordinary
Diligence in Servants, and all laudable Actions he takes notice of himself, and
often commends them to their Faces; but leaves it to his Steward to reprove or
dismiss those he dislikes.

{#45} Well judg'd.

{#46} Whoever lives with him is taken care of in Sickness as well as in Health.
The Wages he gives are above double those of other Masters, and he often makes
Presents to those, that are more than ordinary observing and industrious to
please: but he suffers no body to take a Penny of his Friends or others, that
come to his House on any Account whatever. Many Faults are conniv'd at, or
pardon'd for the first time, but a Breach of this Order is ever attended with
the Loss of their Places, as soon as it is found out; and there is a Premium for
the Discovery.

{#47} This is the only exceptionable thing in my Opinion that I have heard yet.

{#48} I wonder at that: Why so, pray?

{#49} In the first place, it is very difficult to enforce Obedience to such a
Command; Secondly, if it could be executed, it would be of little use; unless it
could be made general, which is impossible: and therefore I look upon the
Attempt of introducing this Maxim to be singular and fantastical. It would
please Misers and others, that would never follow the Example at Home; but it
would take away from generous Men a handsome Opportunity of shewing their
liberal and beneficent Disposition: besides, it would manifestly make ones House
too open to all sorts of People.

{#50} Ways might be found to prevent that; but then it would be a Blessing, and
do great Kindness to Men of Parts and Education, that have little to spare, to
many of whom this Money to Servants is a very grievous Burden.

{#51} What you mention is the only thing that can be said for it, and I own, of
great Weight: But I beg your Pardon for interrupting you.

{#52} In all his Dealings he is punctual and just. As he has an immense Estate,
so he has good Managers to take care of it: But tho' all his Accounts are very
neatly kept, yet he makes it part of his Business to look them over himself. He
suffers no Tradesman's Bill to lie by unexamin'd, and tho' he meddles not with
his ready Cash himself, yet he is a quick and chearful, as well as an exact
Pay-master; and the only Singularity he is guilty of, is, that he never will owe
any thing on a New-Year's Day.

{#53} I like that very well.

{#54} He is affable with Discretion, of easy Access, and never ruffled with
Passion. To sum up all, no Man seems to be less elevated with his Condition than
himself; and in the full Enjoyment of so many personal Accomplishments, as well
as other Possessions, his Modesty is equal to the rest of his Happiness; and in
the midst of the Pomp and Distinction he lives in, he never appears to be
entertain'd with his Greatness, but rather unacquainted with the Things he
excels in.

{#55} It is an admirable Character, and pleases me exceedingly; but I will
freely own to you, that I should have been more highly delighted with the
Description, if I had not known your Design, and the Use you intend to make of
it; which, I think, is barbarous: to raise so fine, so elegant, and so complete
an Edifice, in order to throw it down, is taking great Pains to shew ones Skill
in doing Mischief. I have observ'd the several Places where you left room for
Evasions, and sapping the Foundation you have built upon. _His Heart seems to be
as open;_ and _He never appears to be entertain'd with his Greatness._ I am
persuaded, that, where-ever you have put in this _seeming_ and _appearing,_ you
have done it designedly, and with an Intent to make use of them as so many
Back-doors to creep out at. I could never have taken Notice of these Things, if
you had not acquainted me with your Intention before-hand.

{#56} I have made use of the Caution you speak of: But with no other View than
to avoid just Censure, and prevent your accusing me of Incorrectness, or judging
with too much Precipitation; if it should be proved afterwards, that this
Gentleman had acted from an ill Principle, which is the thing I own I purpos'd
to convince you of; but seeing, that it would be unpleasant to you, I'll be
satisfied with having given you some small Entertainment in the Description, and
for the rest, I give you Leave to think me in the Wrong.

{#57} Why so? I thought the Character was made and contriv'd on purpose for my
Instruction.

{#58} I don't pretend to instruct you: I would have offer'd something, and
appeal'd to your Judgment; but I have been mistaken, and plainly see my Error.
Both last Night and now, when we began our Discourse, I took you to be in
another Disposition of thinking, than I perceive you are. You spoke of an
Impression that had been made upon you, and of looking into your self, and gave
some other Hints, which too rashly I misconstrued in my Favour; but I have found
since, that you are as warm as ever against the Sentiments I profess myself to
be of; and therefore I'll desist. I expect no Pleasure from any Triumph, and I
know nothing, that would vex me more, than the Thoughts of disobliging you. Pray
let us do in this as we do in another matter of Importance, never touch upon it:
Friends in Prudence should avoid all Subjects in which they are known
essentially to differ. Believe me, _Horatio,_ if it was in my Power to divert or
give you any Pleasure, I would grudge no Pains to compass that End: But to make
you uneasy, is a thing that I shall never be knowingly guilty of, and I beg a
thousand Pardons for having said so much both Yesterday and To-day. Have you
heard any thing from _Gibraltar?_

{#59} I am ashamed of my Weakness and your Civility: You have not been mistaken
in the Hints you speak of; what you have said has certainly made a great
Impression upon me, and I have endeavour'd to examine myself: But, as you say,
it is a severe Task to do it faithfully. I desired you to dine with me on
purpose, that we might talk of these Things. It is I that have offended, and it
is I that ought to ask Pardon for the ill Manners I have been guilty of: But you
know the Principles I have always adhered to; it is impossible to recede from
them at once. I see great Difficulties, and now and then a Glimpse of Truth,
that makes me start: I sometimes feel great Struggles within; but I have been so
used to derive all Actions that are really good from laudable Motives, that as
soon as I return to my accustom'd way of thinking, it carries all before it.
Pray bear with my Infirmities. I am in Love with your fine Gentleman, and I
confess, I cannot see how a Person so universally good, so far remote from all
Selfishness, can act in such an extraordinary manner every way, but from
Principles of Virtue and Religion. Where is there such a Landlord in the World?
If I am in an Error, I shall be glad to be undeceiv'd. Pray inform me, and say
what you will, I promise you to keep my Temper, and, I beg of you, speak your
Mind with Freedom.

{#60} You have bid me before say what I would, and when I did, you seem'd
displeas'd; but since you command me, I will try once more—— —— ——Whether there
is or ever was such a Man as I have describ'd in the World, is not very
material: But I will easily allow that most People would think it less
difficult, to conceive one, than to imagine, that such a clear and beautiful
Stream could flow from so mean and muddy a Spring as an excessive Thirst after
Praise, and an immoderate Desire of general Applause from the most knowing
Judges: Yet it is certain, that great Parts and extraordinary Riches may compass
all this in a Man, who is not deform'd, and has had a refin'd Education; and
that there are many Persons naturally no better than thousand others; who by the
Helps mention'd might attain to those good Qualities and Accomplishments; If
they had but Resolution and Perseverance enough, to render every Appetite and
every Faculty subservient to that one predominant Passion, which, if continually
gratify'd, will always enable them to govern, and, if requir'd, to subdue all
the rest without Exception, even in the most difficult Cases.

{#61} To enter into an Argument, concerning the Possibility of what you say,
might occasion a long Dispute; but the Probability, I think, is very clear
against you, and if there was such a Man, it would be much more credible, that
he acted from the Excellency of his Nature, in which so many Virtues and rare
Endowments were assembled, than that all his good Qualities sprung from vicious
Motives. If Pride could be the Cause of all this, the Effect of it would
sometimes appear in others: According to your System, there is no scarcity of
it, and there are Men of great Parts and prodigious Estates all over _Europe:_
Why are there not several such Patterns to be seen up and down, as you have
drawn us one; and why is it so very seldom, that many Virtues and good Qualities
are seen to meet in one Individual?

{#62} Why so few Persons, tho' there are so many Men of immense Fortune, ever
arrive at any thing like this high pitch of Accomplishments, there are several
Reasons that are very obvious. In the first place, Men differ in Temperament:
Some are naturally of an active, stirring; others of an indolent, quiet
Disposition; some of a bold, others of a meek Spirit. In the second, it is to be
consider'd, that this Temperament in Men come to Maturity is more or less
conspicuous, according as it has been either check'd or encourag'd by Education.
Thirdly, that on these two depend the different Perception Men have of
Happiness, according to which the Love of Glory determines them different ways.
Some think it the greatest Felicity to govern and rule over others: Some take
the Praise of Bravery and Undauntedness in Dangers to be the most valuable:
Others, Erudition, and to be a celebrated Author: So that, tho' they all love
Glory, they set out differently to acquire it. But a Man, who hates a Bustle,
and is naturally of a quiet, easy Temper, and which has been encouraged in him
by Education, it is very likely might think nothing more desirable than the
Character of a Fine Gentleman; and if he did, I dare say, that he would
endeavour to behave himself pretty near the Pattern I have given you; I say
pretty near, because I may have been mistaken in some Things, and as I have not
touch'd upon every thing, some will say, that I have left out several necessary
ones: But in the main I believe, that in the Country and Age we live in, the
Qualifications I have named would get a Man the Reputation I have supposed him
to desire.

{#63} Without doubt. I make no manner of scruple about what you said last, and I
told you before that it was an admirable Character, and pleas'd me exceedingly.
That I took Notice of your making your Gentleman so very Godly as you did, was
because it is not common, but I intended it not as a Reflection. One thing
indeed there was in which I differ'd from you; but that was merely speculative;
and, since I have reflected on what you answered me, I don't know, but I may be
in the wrong, as I should certainly believe myself to be, if there really was
such a Man, and he was of the contrary Opinion: To such a fine Genius I would
pay an uncommon Deference, and with great Readiness submit my Understanding to
his superiour Capacity. But the Reasons you give, why those Effects, which you
ascribe to Pride, are not more common, the Cause being so universal, I think are
insufficient. That Men are prompted to follow different Ends, as their
Inclinations differ, I can easily allow; but there are great Numbers of rich Men
that are likewise of a quiet and indolent Disposition, and moreover very
desirous of being thought fine Gentlemen: How comes it, that among so many
Persons of high Birth, princely Estates and the most refin'd Education, as there
are in Christendom, that study, travel, and take great Pains to be
well-accomplish'd, there is not one, to whom all the good Qualities and every
thing you named could be applied without Flattery?

{#64} It is very possible, that thousands may aim at this, and not one of them
succeed to that Degree: in some perhaps the predominant Passion is not strong
enough entirely to subdue the rest: Love or Covetousness may divert others:
Drinking, Gaming may draw away many, and break in upon their Resolution; they
may not have strength to persevere in a Design, and steadily to pursue the same
Ends; or they may want a true Taste and Knowledge of what is esteem'd by Men of
Judgment; or lastly they may not be so thoroughly well-bred as is required to
conceal themselves on all Emergencies: For the Practical Part of Dissimulation
is infinitely more difficult than the Theory; and any one of these Obstacles is
sufficient to spoil all, and hinder the finishing of such a Piece.

{#65} I shall not dispute that with you: But all this while you have proved
nothing, nor given the least Reason why you should imagine, that a Man of a
Character, to all outward Appearance so bright and beautiful, acted from vicious
Motives. You would not condemn him without so much as naming the Cause why you
suspect him.

{#66} By no means; nor have I advanced any thing, that is ill-natured or
uncharitable: For I have not said, that if I found a Gentleman in Possession of
all the Things I mention'd, I would give his rare Endowments this Turn, and
think all his Perfections derived from no better Stock than an extraordinary
Love of Glory. What I argue for, and insist upon, is, the Possibility that all
these Things might be perform'd by a Man from no other Views, and with no other
Helps, than those I have named: Nay, I believe moreover, that a Gentleman so
accomplished, all his Knowledge and great Parts notwithstanding, may himself be
ignorant, or at least not well assured of the Motive he acts from.

{#67} This is more unintelligible than any thing you have said yet; Why will you
heap Difficulties upon one another, without solving any? I desire you would
clear up this last Paradox, before you do any thing else.

{#68} In order to obey you, I must put you in mind of what happens in early
Education, by the first Rudiments of which Infants are taught, in the Choice of
Actions to prefer the Precepts of others, to the Dicates of their own
Inclinations; which in short is no more than doing as they are bid. To gain this
Point, Punishments and Rewards are not neglected, and many different Methods are
made use of; but it is certain, that nothing proves more often effectual for
this Purpose, or has a greater Influence upon Children, than the Handle that is
made of Shame; which, tho' a natural Passion, they would not be sensible of so
soon, if we did not artfully rouze and stir it up in them, before they can speak
or go: By which means, their Judgments being then weak, we may teach them to be
asham'd of what we please, as soon as we can perceive them to be any ways
affected with the Passion itself. But as the fear of Shame is very
insignificant, where there is but little Pride; so it is impossible to augment
the first, without encreasing the latter in the same Proportion.

{#69} I should have thought that this Encrease of Pride would render Children
more stubborn and less docile.

{#70} You judge right, it would so; and must have been a great Hindrance to good
Manners, till Experience taught Men, that, tho' Pride was not to be destroy'd by
Force, it might be govern'd by Stratagem, and that the best way to manage it, is
by playing the Passion against itself. Hence it is that in an artful Education
we are allow'd to place as much Pride as we please in our Dexterity of
concealing it. I do not suppose, that this covering ourselves, notwithstanding
the Pride we take in it, is perform'd without a Difficulty that is plainly felt,
and perhaps very unpleasant at first; but this wears off as we grow up; and when
a Man has behaved himself with so much Prudence as I have describ'd, lived up to
the strictest Rules of good Breeding for many Years, and has gain'd the Esteem
of all that know him, when his noble and polite Manner is become habitual to
him, it is possible, he may in time forget the Principle he set out with, and
become ignorant, or at least insensible of the hidden Spring, that gives Life
and Motion to all his Actions.

{#71} I am convinc'd of the great Use that may be made of Pride, if you will
call it so; but I am not satisfied yet, how a Man of so much Sense, Knowledge
and Penetration, one that understands himself so entirely well, should be
ignorant of his own Heart, and the Motives he acts from. What is it that induces
you to believe this, besides the Possibility of his Forgetfulness?

{#72} I have two Reasons for it, which I desire may be seriously consider'd. The
first is, that in what relates to ourselves, especially our own Worth and
Excellency, Pride blinds the Understanding in Men of Sense and great Parts as
well as in others, and the greater Value we may reasonably set upon ourselves,
the fitter we are to swallow the grossest Flatteries in spight of all our
Knowledge and Abilities in other Matters: Witness _Alexander the Great,_ whose
vast Genius could not hinder him from doubting seriously, whether he was a God
or not. My second Reason will prove to us; that, if the Person in question was
capable of examining himself, it is yet highly improbable, that he would ever
set about it: For it must be granted, that in order to search into ourselves, it
is required, we should be willing as well as able; and we have all the Reason in
the World to think, that there is nothing, which a very proud Man of such high
Qualifications would avoid more carefully, than such an Enquiry: Because for all
other Acts of Self-denial he is repaid in his darling Passion; but this alone is
really mortifying, and the only Sacrifice of his Quiet, for which he can have no
Equivalent. If the Hearts of the best and sincerest Men are corrupt and
deceitful, what Condition must theirs be in, whose whole Life is one continued
Scene of Hypocrisy! Therefore enquiring within, and boldly searching into ones
own Bosom, must be the most shocking Employment, that a Man can give his Mind
to, whose greatest Pleasure consists in secretly admiring himself. It would be
ill Manners after this to appeal to your self; but the Severity of the Task. …

{#73} Say no more, I yield this Point, tho' I own, I cannot conceive what
Advantage you can expect from it: For, instead of removing, it will rather help
to encrease the grand Difficulty, which is to prove, that this complete Person
you have describ'd, acts from a vicious Motive: And if that be not your Design,
I cannot see what you drive at.

{#74} I told you it was.

{#75} You must have a prodigious Sagacity in detecting abstruse Matters beyond
other Men.

{#76} You wonder, I know, which way I arrogate to my self such a superlative
Degree of Penetration, as to know an artful cunning Man better than he does
himself, and how I dare pretend to enter and look into a Heart, which I have
own'd to be completely well conceal'd from all the World; which in strictness is
an Impossibility, and consequently not to be bragg'd of but by a Coxcomb.

{#77} You may treat yourself as you please, I have  said no such thing; but I
own that I long to see it proved, that you have this Capacity. I remember the
Character very well: Notwithstanding the Precautions you have taken, it is very
full: I told you before, that where Things have a handsome Appearance every way,
there can be no just Cause to suspect them. I'll stick close to that; your
Gentleman is all of a piece: You shall alter nothing, either by retracting any
of the good Qualities you have given him, or making Additions that are either
clashing with, or unsuitable to what you have allow'd already.

{#78} I shall attempt neither: And without that decisive Tryals may be made, by
which it will plainly appear, whether a Person acts from inward Goodness and a
Principle of Religion, or only from a Motive of Vain-glory; and, in the latter
Case, there is an infallible way of dragging the lurking Fiend from his darkest
Recesses into a glaring Light, where all the World shall know him.

{#79} I don't think my self a Match for you in Argument; but I have a great Mind
to be your Gentleman's Advocate against all your Infallibility: I never liked a
Cause better in my Life. Come, I undertake to defend him in all the Suppositions
you can make, that are reasonable, and consistent with what you have said
before.

{#80} Very well: Let us suppose what may happen to the most inoffensive, the
most prudent and best-bred Man; that our fine Gentleman differs in Opinion
before Company, with another, who is his Equal in Birth and Quality, but not so
much Master over his outward Behaviour, and less guarded in his Conduct: Let
this Adversary, _mal a propos,_ grow warm, and seem to be wanting in the Respect
that is due to the other, and reflect on his Honour in ambiguous Terms. What is
your Client to do?

{#81} Immediately to ask for an Explanation.

{#82} Which if the hot Man disregards with Scorn, or flatly refuses to give,
Satisfaction must be demanded, and tilt they must.

{#83} You are too hasty: It happen'd before Company; in such Cases, Friends or
any Gentlemen present, should interpose and take care, that, if threatning Words
ensue, they are by the civil Authority both put under Arrest, and before they
came to uncourteous Language, they ought to have been parted by friendly Force,
if it were possible. After that, Overtures may be made of Reconciliation with
the nicest Regard to the Point of Honour.

{#84} I don't ask for Directions to prevent a Quarrel; what you say may be done,
or it may not be done: The good Offices of Friends may succeed, and they may not
succeed. I am to make what Suppositions I think fit within the Verge of
Possibility, so they are reasonable and consistent with the Character I have
drawn: Can we not suppose these two Persons in such a Situation, that you
yourself would advise your Friend to send his Adversary a Challenge?

{#85} Without doubt such a thing may happen.

{#86} That's enough. After that a Duel must ensue; in which, without determining
any thing, the Fine Gentleman, we'll say, behaves himself with the utmost
Gallantry.

{#87} To have expected or suppos'd otherwise would have been unreasonable.

{#88} You see therefore how fair I am. But what is it, pray, that so suddenly
disposes a courteous Sweet-temper'd Man, for so small an Evil, to seek a Remedy
of that extreme Violence? but above all, what is it, that buoys up and supports
him against the Fear of Death? for there lies the greatest Difficulty.

{#89} His natural Courage and Intrepidity, built on the Innocence of his Life,
and the Rectitude of his Manners.

{#90} But what makes so just and prudent a Man, that has the Good of Society so
much at Heart, act knowingly against the Laws of his Country?

{#91} The strict Obedience he pays to the Laws of Honour, which are superior to
all others.

{#92} If Men of Honour would act consistently, they ought all to be _Roman_
Catholicks.

{#93} Why, pray?

{#94} Because they prefer oral Tradition to all written Laws: For no body can
tell, when, in what King's or Emperor's Reign, in what Country or by what
Authority these Laws of Honour were first enacted: It is very strange they
should be of such Force.

{#95} They are wrote and engraved in every one's Breast that is a Man of Honour:
there is no denying of it, you are conscious of it your self, every body feels
it within.

{#96} Let them be wrote or engraved where-ever you please, they are directly
opposite to and clashing with the Laws of God; and if the Gentleman I described
was as sincere in his Religion, as he appear'd to be, he must have been of an
Opinion contrary to yours; for Christians of all Persuasions are unanimous in
allowing the Divine Laws to be far above all other; and that all other
Considerations ought to give Way to them. How, and under what Pretence can a
Christian, who is a Man of Sense, submit or agree to Laws that prescribe
Revenge, and countenance Murder; both which are so expressly forbid by the
Precepts of his Religion?

{#97} I am no Casuist: But you know, that what I say is true; and that among
Persons of Honour a Man would be laugh'd at, that should make such a Scruple.
Not but that I think killing a Man to be a great Sin, where it can be help'd;
and that all prudent Men ought to avoid the Occasion, as much as it is in their
Power: He is highly blameable who is the first Aggressor and gives the Affront;
and whoever enters upon it out of Levity, or seeks a Quarrel out of Wantonness,
ought to be hang'd: No body would chuse it, who is not a Fool; and yet, when it
is forc'd upon one, all the Wisdom in the World cannot teach him how to avoid
it. It has been my Case, you know: I shall never forget the Reluctancy I had
against it; but Necessity has no Law.

{#98} I saw you that very Morning, and you seem' d to be sedate and void of
Passion: You could have no Concern.

{#99} It is silly to shew any at such Times; but I know best what I felt; the
Struggle I had within was unspeakable: It is a terrible Thing. I would then have
given a considerable Part of my Estate, that the Thing which forc'd me into it
had not happen'd, and yet upon less Provocation I would act the same Part again
to-morrow.

{#100} Do you remember what your Concern was chiefly about?

{#101} How can you ask? It is an Affair of the highest Importance, that can
occur in Life; I was no Boy; it was after we came from _Italy,_ I was in my nine
and twentieth Year, had very good Acquaintance, and was not ill receiv'd: A Man
of that Age, in Health and Vigour, who has seven thousand a Year, and the
Prospect of being a Peer of _England,_ has no Reason to quarrel with the World,
or wish himself out of it. It is a very great Hazard a Man runs in a Duel;
besides the Remorse and Uneasiness one must feel as long as he lives, if he has
the Misfortune of killing his Adversary. It is impossible to reflect on all
these Things, and at the same Time resolve to run those Hazards, (tho' there are
other Considerations of still greater Moment) without being under a prodigious
Concern.

{#102} You say nothing about the Sin.

{#103} The Thoughts of that, without doubt, are a great Addition; but the other
Things are so weighty of themselves, that a Man's Condition at such a Time is
very perplex'd without further Reflection.

{#104} You have now a very fine Opportunity, _Horatio,_ of looking into your
Heart, and, with a little of my Assistance, examining yourself. If you can
condescend to this, I promise you, that you shall make great Discoveries, and be
convinc'd of Truths you are now unwilling to believe. A Lover of Justice and
Probity, as you are, ought not to be fond of a Road of Thinking, where he is
always forc'd to skulk, and never dares to meet with Light or Reason. Will you
suffer me to ask you some Questions, and will you answer them directly and in
good Humour?

{#105} I will, without Reserve.

{#106} Do you remember the Storm upon the Coast of _Genoa?_

{#107} Going to _Naples?_ very well; it makes me cold to think of it.

{#108} Was you afraid?

{#109} Never more in my Life. I hate that fickle Element, I can't endure the
Sea.

{#110} What was you afraid of?

{#111} That's a pretty Question: Do you think a young Fellow of six and twenty,
as I was then, and in my Circumstances, had a great Mind to be drown'd? The
Captain himself said we were in Danger.

{#112} But neither he nor any body else discover'd half so much Fear and Anxiety
as you did.

{#113} There was no body there, yourself excepted, that had half a quarter so
much to lose as I had: Besides, they are used to the Sea; Storms are familiar to
them. I had never been at Sea before, but that fine Afternoon we cross'd from
_Dover_ to _Calais._

{#114} Want of Knowledge and Experience may make Men apprehend Danger where
there is none; but real Dangers, when they are known to be such, try the natural
Courage of all Men; whether they have been used to them or not: Sailors are as
unwilling to lose their Lives as other People.

{#115} I am not ashamed to own, that I am a great Coward at Sea: Give me _Terra
Firma,_ and then—–

{#116} Six or seven Months after you fought that Duel, I remember you had the
Small-Pox; you was then very much afraid of dying.

{#117} Not without a Cause.

{#118} I heard your Physicians say, that the violent Apprehension you was under,
hinder'd your Sleep, increased your Fever, and was as mischievous to you as the
Distemper itself.

{#119} That was a terrible Time; I'm glad it is over: I had a Sister died of it.
Before I had it, I was in perpetual Dread of it, and many Times to hear it named
only has made me uneasy.

{#120} Natural Courage is a general Armour against the Fear of Death, whatever
Shape that appears in, _Sin fractus illabatur orbis._ It supports a Man in
tempestuous Seas, and in a burning Fever, whilst he is in his Senses, as well as
in a Siege before a Town, or in a Duel with Seconds.

{#121} What! you are going to shew me, that I have no Courage.

{#122} Far from it; it would be ridiculous to doubt a Man's Bravery, that has
shewn it in such an extraordinary manner as you have done more than once: What I
question is the Epithet you join'd to it at first, the Word _natural;_ for there
is a great Difference between that and _artificial_ Courage.

{#123} That's a Chicane I won't enter into: But I am not of your Opinion, as to
what you said before. A Gentleman is not required to shew his Bravery, but where
his Honour is concern'd; and if he dares to fight for his King, his Friend, his
Mistress, and every thing where his Reputation is engaged, you shall think of
him what you please for the rest. Besides that in Sickness and other Dangers, as
well as Afflictions, where the Hand of God is plainly to be seen, Courage and
Intrepidity are impious as well as impertinent. Undauntedness in Chastisements
is a Kind of Rebellion: It is waging War with Heaven, which none but Atheists
and Free-Thinkers would be guilty of; it is only they that can glory in
Impenitence, and talk of dying hard. All others, that have any Sense of
Religion, desire to repent before they go out of the World: The best of us don't
always live, as we could wish to die.

{#124} I am very glad to hear you are so religious: But don't you perceive yet,
how inconsistent you are with yourself; how can a Man sincerely wish to repent,
that willfully plunges himself into a mortal Sin, and an Action where he runs a
greater and more immediate Hazard of his Life, than he could have done in almost
any other; without Force or Necessity?

{#125} I have over and over own'd to you that Duelling is a Sin; and, unless a
Man is forced to it by Necessity, I believe, a mortal one: But this was not my
Case, and therefore I hope God will forgive me: Let them look to it that make a
Sport of it. But when a Man comes to an Action with the utmost Reluctancy, and
what he does is not possibly to be avoided, I think he then may justly be said
to be forc'd to it, and to act from Necessity. You may blame the rigorous Laws
of Honour and the Tyranny of Custom, but a Man that will live in the World must
and is bound to obey them. Would not you do it yourself?

{#126} Don't ask me what I would do: The Question is, what every body ought to
do. Can a Man believe the Bible, and at the same Time apprehend a Tyrant more
crafty or malicious, more unrelenting or inhuman than the Devil, or a Mischief
worse than Hell, and Pains either more exquisite or more durable than Torments
unspeakable and yet everlasting? You don't answer. What Evil is it? think of it,
and tell me what dismal Thing it is you apprehend, should you neglect those
Laws, and despise that Tyrant: what Calamity could befall you? Let me know the
worst that can be fear'd.

{#127} Would you be posted for a Coward?

{#128} For what? for not daring to violate all human and divine Laws?

{#129} Strictly speaking you are in the right, it is unanswerable; But who will
consider Things in that Light?

{#130} All good Christians.

{#131} Where are they then? for all Mankind in general would despise and laugh
at a Man, who should move those Scruples. I have heard and seen Clergymen
themselves in Company shew their Contempt of Poltrons, whatever they might talk
or recommend in the Pulpit. Entirely to quit the World, and at once to renounce
the Conversation of all Persons that are valuable in it, is a terrible Thing to
resolve upon. Would you become a Town and Table-talk? could you submit to be the
Jest and Scorn of Publick-Houses, Stage Coaches, and Market-Places? Is not this
the certain Fate of a Man, who should refuse to fight, or bear an Affront
without Resentment? Be just, _Cleomenes;_ is it to be avoided? Must he not be
made a common Laughing-stock, be pointed at in the Streets, and serve for
Diversion to the very Children, to Link-boys and Hackney Coachmen? Is it a
Thought to be born with Patience?

{#132} How come you now to have such an anxious Regard for what may be the
Opinion of the Vulgar, whom at other Times you so heartily despise?

{#133} All this is Reasoning, and you know the Thing will not bear it: how can
you be so cruel?

{#134} How can you be so backward in discovering and owning the Passion, that is
so conspicuously the Occasion of all this, the palpable and only Cause of the
Uneasiness we feel at the Thoughts of being despis'd?

{#135} I am not sensible of any; and I declare to you, that I feel nothing that
moves me to speak as I do, but the Sense and Principle of Honour within me.

{#136} Do you think that the lowest of the Mob, and the Scum of the People, are
possess'd of any Part of this Principle?

{#137} No, indeed.

{#138} Or that among the highest Quality Infants can be affected with it before
they are two Years old?

{#139} Ridiculous.

{#140} If neither of these are affected with it, then Honour should be either
adventitious, and acquir'd by Culture; or, if contain'd in the Blood of those
that are nobly born, imperceptible 'till the Years of Discretion; and neither of
them can be said of the Principle, the palpable Cause I speak of. For we plainly
see on the one hand, that Scorn and Ridicule are intollerable to the poorest
Wretches, and that there is no Beggar so mean or miserable, that Contempt will
never offend him: On the other, that human Creatures are so early influenced by
the Sense of Shame, that Children, by being laugh'd at and made a Jest of, may
be set a crying before they can well speak or go. Whatever therefore this mighty
Principle is, it is born with us, and belongs to our Nature: Are you
unacquainted with the proper, genuine, homely Name of it?

{#141} I know you call it Pride. I won't dispute with you about Principles and
Origins of Things; but that high Value which Men of Honour set upon themselves
as such, and which is no more than what is due to the Dignity of our Nature,
when well culti-vated, is the Foundation of their Character, and a Support to
them in all Difficulties, that is of great Use to the Society. The Desire
likewise of being thought well of, and the Love of Praise and even of Glory are
commendable Qualities, that are beneficial to the Publick. The Truth of this is
manifest in the Reverse; all shameless People that are below Infamy, and matter
not what is said or thought of them, these, we see, no body can trust; they
stick at nothing, and if they can but avoid Death, Pain, and penal Laws, are
always ready to execute all manner of Mischief, their Selfishness or any brutal
Appetite shall prompt them to, without Regard to the Opinion of others: Such are
justly call'd Men of no Principles, because they have nothing of any Strength
within, that can either spur them on to brave and virtuous Actions, or restrain
them from Villainy and Baseness.

{#142} The first Part of your Assertion is very true, when that high Value, that
Desire and that Love are kept within the Bounds of Reason: But in the second
there is a Mistake; those, whom we call Shameless, are not more destitute of
Pride than their Betters. Remember what I have said of Education, and the Power
of it; you may add Inclinations, Knowledge, and Circumstances; for as Men differ
in all these, so they are differently influenced and wrought upon by all the
Passions. There is nothing that some Men may not be taught to be ashamed of. The
same Passion, that makes the well-bred Man and prudent Officer value and
secretly admire themselves for the Honour and Fidelity they display, may make
the Rake and Scoundrel brag of their Vices and boast of their Impudence.

{#143} I cannot comprehend, how a Man of Honour, and one that has none, should
both act from the same Principle.

{#144} This is not more strange, than that Self-love may make a Man destroy
himself, yet nothing is more true; and it is as certain, that some Men indulge
their Pride in being shameless. To understand human Nature requires Study and
Application, as well as Penetration and Sagacity. All Passions and Instincts in
general were given to all Animals for some wise End, tending to the Preservation
and Happiness either of themselves or their Species: It is our Duty to hinder
them from being detrimental or offensive to any Part of the Society; but why
should we be ashamed of having them? The Instinct of high Value, which every
Individual has for himself, is a very useful Passion: but a Passion it is, and
though I could demonstrate, that we should be miserable Creatures without it,
yet, when it is excessive, it often is the Cause of endless Mischiefs.

{#145} But in well-bred People it never is excessive.

{#146} You mean the Excess of it never appears outwardly: But we ought never to
judge of its Height or Strength from what we can discover of the Passion itself,
but from the Effects it produces: It often is most superlative, where it is most
conceal'd; and nothing increases and influences it more, than what is call'd a
refin'd Education, and a continual Commerce with the _Beau monde:_ The only
Thing, that can subdue or any ways curb it, is a strict Adherence to the
Christian Religion.

{#147} Why do you so much insist upon it, that this Principle, this Value Men
set upon themselves, is a Passion? And why will you chuse to call it Pride
rather than Honour?

{#148} For very good Reasons. Fixing this Principle in human Nature, in the
first place, takes away all Ambiguity: Who is a Man of Honour, and who is not,
is often a disputable Point; and, among those, that are allow'd to be such, the
several Degrees of Strictness in complying with the Rules of it, make great
Difference in the Principle itself. But a Passion that is born with us is
unalterable, and Part of our Frame, whether it exerts itself or not: The Essence
of it is the same, which Way soever it is taught to turn. Honour is the
undoubted Offspring of Pride, but the same Cause produces not always the same
Effect. All the Vulgar, Children, Savages and many others that are not affected
with any Sense of Honour, have all of them Pride, as is evident from the
Symptoms. Secondly, it helps us to explain the Ph{ae}nomena that occur in
Quarrels and Affronts, and the Behaviour of Men of Honour on these Occasions,
which cannot be accounted for any other Way. But what moves me to it most of
all, is the prodigious Force and exorbitant Power of this Principle of
Self-Esteem, where it has been long gratify'd and encourag'd. You remember the
Concern you was under, when you had that Duel upon your Hands, and the great
Reluctancy you felt in doing what you did; you knew it to be a Crime, and at the
same Time had a strong Aversion to it; What secret Power was it, that subdued
your Will and gain'd the Victory over that great Reluctancy you felt against it?
You call it Honour, and the too strict though unavoidable Adherence to the Rules
of it: But Men never commit Violence upon themselves but in struggling with the
Passions that are innate and natural to them. Honour is acquir'd, and the Rules
of it are taught: Nothing adventitious, that some are possess'd and others
destitute of, could raise such intestine Wars and dire Commotions within us; and
therefore whatever is the Cause, that can thus divide us against ourselves, and,
as it were, rend human Nature in twain, must be Part of us; and to speak without
Disguise, the Struggle in your Breast was between the Fear of Shame and the Fear
of Death; had this latter not been so considerable, your Struggle would have
been less: Still the first conquered, because it was strongest; but if your Fear
of Shame had been inferior to that of Death, you would have reason'd otherwise,
and found out some Means or other to have avoided Fighting.

{#149} This is a strange Anatomy of human Nature.

{#150} Yet, for want of making Use of it, the Subject we are upon is not rightly
understood by many; and Men have discours'd very inconsistently on Duelling. A
Divine who wrote a Dialogue to explode that Practice, said, that those, who were
guilty of it, had mistaken Notions of, and went by false Rules of Honour; for
which my Friend justly ridicul'd him; saying, _You may as well deny, that it is
the Fashion what you see every body wear, as to say, that demanding and giving
Satisfaction is against the Law of true Honour._ Had that Man understood human
Nature, he could not have committed such a Blunder: But when once he took it for
granted, that Honour is a just and good Principle, without enquiring into the
Cause of it among the Passions, it is impossible he should have accounted for
Duelling, in a Christian pretending to act from such a Principle; and therefore
in another Place, with the same Justice, he said, that a Man who had accepted a
Challenge was not qualify'd to make his Will, because he was not _Compos
Mentis:_ He might with greater Shew of Reason have said, that he was bewitch'd.

{#151} Why so?

{#152} Because People out of their Wits, as they think at Random, so commonly
they act and talk incoherently; but when a Man of known Sobriety, and who shews
no manner of Discomposure, discourses and behaves himself in every thing, as he
is used to do; and moreover, reasons on Points of great Nicety with the utmost
Accuracy, it is impossible we should take him to be either a Fool or a Madman;
and when such a Person in an Affair of the highest Importance acts so
diametrically against his Interest, that a Child can see it; and with
Deliberation pursues his own Destruction, those who believe that there are
malignant Spirits of that Power, would rather imagine, that he was led away by
some Enchantment, and overrul'd by the Enemy of Mankind, than they would fancy a
palpable Absurdity: But even the Supposition of that is not sufficient to solve
the Difficulty, without the Help of that strange Anatomy. For what Spell or
Witchcraft is there, by the Delusion of which a Man of Understanding shall,
keeping his Senses, mistake an imaginary Duty for an unavoidable Necessity to
break all real Obligations? But let us wave all Ties of Religion as well as
human Laws, and the Person we speak of be a profess'd _Epicure,_ that has no
Thoughts of Futurity; what violent Power of Darkness is it, that can force and
compel a peaceable quiet Man, neither inured to Hardship, nor valiant by Nature,
to quit his beloved Ease and Security; and seemingly by Choice go fight in cold
Blood for his Life, with this comfortable Reflection, that nothing forfeits it
so certainly as the entire Defeat of his Enemy?

{#153} As to the Law and the Punishment, Persons of Quality have little to fear
of that.

{#154} You can't say that in _France,_ nor the Seven Provinces. But Men of
Honour, that are of much lower Ranks, decline Duelling no more than those of the
highest Quality. How many Examples have we, even here, of gallant Men, that have
suffer'd for it, either by Exile or the Hangman! A Man of Honour must fear
nothing: Do but consider every Obstacle, which this Principle of Self-Esteem has
conquer'd at one Time or other; and then tell me whether it must not be
something more than Magick, by the Fascination of which, a Man of Taste and
Judgment, in Health and Vigour, as well as the Flower of his Age, can be tempted
and actually drawn from the Embraces of a Wife he loves, and the Endearments of
hopeful Children, from polite Conversation and the Charms of Friendship, from
the fairest Possessions and the happy Enjoyment of all worldly Pleasures, to an
unwarrantable Combat, of which the Victor must be exposed, either to an
ignominious Death or perpetual Banishment.

{#155} When Things are set in this Light I confess it is very unaccountable: but
will your System explain this; can you make it clear your self?

{#156} Immediately, as the Sun: If you will but observe two things, that must
necessarily follow, and are manifest from what I have demonstrated already. The
first is, that the fear of Shame in general is a matter of Caprice, that varies
with Modes and Customs, and may be fix'd on different Objects, according to the
different Lessons we have receiv'd, and the Precepts we are imbued with; and
that this is the Reason, why this fear of Shame, as it is either well or
ill-placed, sometimes produces very good effects, and at others is the cause of
the most enormous Crimes. Secondly, that, tho' Shame is a real Passion, the Evil
to be fear'd from it is altogether imaginary, and has no Existence but in our
own Reflection on the Opinion of others.

{#157} But there are real and substantial Mischiefs which a Man may draw upon
himself, by misbehaving in Point of Honour; it may ruin his Fortune and all
hopes of Preferment: An Officer may be broken for putting up an Affront: No Body
will serve with a Coward, and who will employ him?

{#158} What you urge is altogether out of the Question; at least it was in your
own case; you had nothing to dread or apprehend but the bare Opinion of Men.
Besides, when the fear of Shame is superior to that of Death, it is likewise
Superior to, and outweighs all other Considerations; as has been sufficiently
proved: But when the fear of Shame is not violent enough to curb the fear of
Death, nothing else can; and whenever the fear of Death is stronger than that of
Shame, there is no Consideration that will make a Man fight in cold Blood, or
comply with any of the Laws of Honour, where Life is at Stake. Therefore whoever
acts from the fear of Shame as a Motive, in sending and accepting of Challenges,
must be sensible on the one hand; that the Mischiefs he apprehends, should he
disobey the Tyrant, can only be the Off-spring of his own Thoughts; and on the
other, that if he could be persuaded any ways to lessen the great Esteem and
high Value he sets upon himself, his Dread of Shame would likewise palpably
diminish. From all which it is most evident, that the grand Cause of this
Distraction, the powerful Enchanter we are seeking after, is Pride, Excess of
Pride, that highest Pitch of Self-Esteem, to which some Men may be wound up by
an artful Education, and the perpetual Flatteries bestow'd upon our Species, and
the Excellencies of our Nature. This is the Sorcerer, that is able to divert all
other Passions from their natural Objects, and make a rational Creature ashamed
of what is most agreeable to his Inclination as well as his Duty; both which the
Duellist owns, that he has knowingly acted against.

{#159} What a wonderful Machine, what an heterogeneous Compound is Man! You have
almost conquer'd me.

{#160} I aim at no Victory, all I wish for is to do you Service, in undeceiving
you.

{#161} What is the Reason that in the same Person the fear of Death should be so
glaringly conspicuous in Sickness, or a Storm, and so entirely well hid in a
Duel, and all military Engagements? Pray solve that too.

{#162} I will as well as I can: On all Emergencies where Reputation is thought
to be concern'd, the fear of Shame is effectually rous'd in Men of Honour, and
immediately their Pride rushes in to their Assistance, and summons all their
Strength to fortify and support them in concealing the fear of Death; by which
extraordinary Efforts, the latter, that is the fear of Death, is altogether
stifled, or at least kept out of Sight, and remains undiscover'd. But in all
other Perils, in which they don't think their Honour engaged, their Pride lies
dormant. And thus the fear of Death being check'd by nothing, appears without
Disguise. That this is the Reason, is manifest from the different Behaviour that
is observ'd in Men of Honour, according as they are either Pretenders to
Christianity or tainted with Irreligion; for there are of both Sorts; and you
shall see, most commonly at least, that your _Esprits forts,_ and those who
would be thought to disbelieve a future State, (I speak of Men of Honour) shew
the greatest Calmness and Intrepidity in the same Dangers, where the pretended
Believers among them appear to be the most ruffled and pusillanimous.

{#163} But why Pretended Believers? at that rate there are no Christians among
the Men of Honour.

{#164} I don't see how they can be real Believers.

{#165} Why so?

{#166} For the same Reason that a _Roman Catholick_ cannot be a good Subject
always to be depended upon, in a Protestant, or indeed any other Country, but
the Dominions of his Holiness. No Sovereign can confide with Safety in a Man's
Allegiance, who owns and pays Homage to another Superior Power upon Earth. I am
sure, you understand me.

{#167} Too well.

{#168} You may yoke a Knight with a Prebendary, and put them together into the
same Stall; but Honour and the Christian Religion make no Couple, _nec in unâ
sede morantur,_ any more than Majesty and Love. Look back on your own Conduct,
and you shall find, that what you said of the Hand of God was only a Shift, an
Evasion, you made to serve your then present Purpose. On another Occasion, you
had said Yesterday yourself, that Providence superintends and governs every
thing without Exception; you must therefore have known, that the Hand of God is
as much to be seen in one common Accident in Life, and in one Misfortune, as it
is in another, that is not more extraordinary. A severe Fit of Sickness may be
less fatal, than a slight Skirmish between two hostile Parties; and among Men of
Honour there is often as much Danger in a Quarrel about nothing, as there can be
in the most violent Storm. It is impossible therefore that a Man of Sense, who
has a solid Principle to go by, should in one sort of Danger think it Impiety
not to shew Fear, and in another be ashamed to be thought to have any. Do but
consider your own Inconsistency with yourself. At one time, to justify your fear
of Death, when Pride is absent, you become religious on a sudden, and your
Conscience then is so tenderly scrupulous, that to be undaunted under
Chastisements from the Almighty, seems no less to you than waging War with
Heaven; and at another, when Honour calls, you dare not only knowingly and
wilfully break the most positive Command of God, but likewise to own; that the
greatest Calamity, which, in your Opinion, can befall you, is, that the World
should believe, or but suspect of you, that you had any Scruple about it. I defy
the Wit of Man to carry the Affront to the Divine Majesty higher. Barely to deny
his Being is not half so daring, as it is to do this after you have own'd him to
exist. No Atheism----

{#169} Hold, _Cleomenes;_ I can no longer resist the Force of Truth, and I am
resolved to be better acquainted with myself for the future. Let me become your
Pupil.

{#170} Don't banter me, _Horatio;_ I don't pretend to instruct a Man of your
Knowledge; but if you will take my Advice, search into yourself with Care and
Boldness, and at your Leisure peruse the Book I recommended.

{#171} I promise you, I will, and shall be glad to accept of the handsome
Present I refus'd: Pray send a Servant with it to Morrow-morning.

{#172} It's a Trifle. You had better let one of yours go with me now; I shall
drive Home directly.

{#173} I understand your Scruple. It shall be as you please.
