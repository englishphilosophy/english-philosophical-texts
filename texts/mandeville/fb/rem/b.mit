{#1} THIS, I confess, is but a very indifferent Compliment to all the Trading
Part of the People. But if the Word _Knave_ may be understood in its full
Latitude, and comprehend every Body that is not sincerely honest, and does to
others what he would dislike to have done to himself, I don't question but I
shall make good the Charge. To pass by the innumerable Artifices, by which
Buyers and Sellers out-wit one another, that are daily allowed of and practised
among the fairest of _Dealers,_ shew me the _Tradesman_ that has always
discover'd the Defects of his Goods to those that cheapen'd them; nay, where
will you find one that has not at one time or other industriously conceal'd
them, to the detriment of the _Buyer?_ Where is the Merchant that has never
against his Conscience extoll'd his Wares beyond their Worth, to make them go
off the better?

{#2} _Decio,_ a Man of great Figure, that had large Commissions for Sugar from
several Parts beyond Sea, treats about a considerable parcel of that Commodity
with _Alcander_ an eminent _West-India_ Merchant; both understood the Market
very well, but could not agree: _Decio_ was a Man of Substance, and thought no
body ought to buy cheaper than himself; _Alcander_ was the same, and not wanting
Money, stood for his Price. While they were driving their Bargain at a Tavern
near the _Exchange, Alcander_'s Man brought his Master a Letter from the
_West-Indies,_ that inform'd him of a much greater quantity of Sugars coming for
_England_ than was expected. _Alcander_ now wish'd for nothing more than to sell
at _Decio_'s Price, before the News was publick; but being a cunning Fox, that
he might not seem too precipitant, nor yet lose his Customer, he drops the
Discourse they were upon, and putting on a Jovial Humour, commends the
Agreeableness of the Weather, from whence falling upon the Delight he took in
his Gardens, invites _Decio_ to go along with him to his Country-House, that was
not above Twelve Miles from _London._ It was in the Month of _May,_ and, as it
happened, upon a _Saturday_ in the Afternoon: _Decio,_ who was a single Man, and
would have no Business in Town before _Tuesday,_ accepts of the other's
Civility, and away they go in _Alcander_'s Coach. _Decio_ was splendidly
entertain'd that Night and the Day following; the _Monday_ Morning, to get
himself an Appetite, he goes to take the Air upon a Pad of _Alcander_'s, and
coming back meets with a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, who tells him News was
come the Night before that the _Barbadoes_ Fleet was destroy'd by a Storm, and
adds, that before he came out it had been confirm'd at _Lloyd_'s Coffee-House,
where it was thought Sugars would rise 25 _per Cent._ by Change-time. _Decio_
returns to his Friend, and immediately resumes the Discourse they had broke off
at the Tavern: _Alcander_, who thinking himself sure of his Chap, did not design
to have moved it till after Dinner, was very glad to see himself so happily
prev-ented ; but how desirous soever he was to sell, the other was yet more
eager to buy; yet both of them afraid of one another, for a considerable time
counterfeited all the Indifference imaginable; 'till at last _Decio_ fired with
what he had heard, thought Delays might prove dangerous, and throwing a Guinea
upon the Table, struck the Bargain at _Alcander_'s Price. The next Day they went
to _London;_ the News prov'd true, and _Decio_ got Five Hundred Pounds by his
Sugars. _Alcander,_ whilst he had strove to over-reach the other, was paid in
his own Coin: yet all this is called fair dealing; but I am sure neither of them
would have desired to be done by, as they did to each other.
