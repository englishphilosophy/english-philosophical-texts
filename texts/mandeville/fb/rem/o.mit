£1 (O.) Real Pleasures, Comforts, Ease. £1

{#1} THAT the highest Good consisted in Pleasure, was the Doctrine of
_Epicurus_, who yet led a Life exemplary for Continence, Sobriety, and other
Virtues, which made People of the succeeding Ages quarrel about the
Signification of Pleasure. Those who argued from the Temperance of the
Philosopher, said, That the Delight _Epicurus_ meant, was being virtuous; so
_Erasmus_ in his _Colloquies_ tells us, That there are no greater _Epicures_
than pious Christians. Others that reflected on the dissolute Manners of the
greatest Part of his Followers, would have it, that by Pleasures he could have
understood nothing but sensual Ones, and the Gratification of our Passions. I
shall not decide their Quarrel, but am of Opinion, that whether Men be good or
bad, what they take delight in is their Pleasure, and not to look out for any
further Etymology from the learned Languages, I believe an _Englishman_ may
justly call every Thing a Pleasure that pleases him, and according to this
Definition we ought to dispute no more about Mens Pleasures than their Tastes:
_Trahit sua quemque Voluptas_.

{#2} The worldly-minded, voluptuous and ambitious Man, notwithstanding he is
void of Merit, covets Precedence every where, and desires to be dignify'd above
his Betters: He aims at spacious Palaces, and delicious Gardens; his chief
Delight is in excelling others in stately Horses, magnificent Coaches, a
numerous Attendance, and dear-bought Furniture. To gratify his Lust, he wishes
for genteel, young, beautiful Women of different Charms and Complexions that
shall adore his Greatness, and be really in love with his Person: His Cellars he
would have stored with the Flower of every Country that produces excellent
Wines: His Table he desires may be serv'd with many Courses, and each of them
contain a choice Variety of Dainties not easily purchas'd, and ample Evidences
of elaborate and judicious Cookery; while harmonious Musick and well-couch'd
Flattery entertain his Hearing by Turns. He employs, even in the meanest
trifles, none but the ablest and most ingenious Workmen, that his Judgment and
Fancy may as evidently appear in the least Things that belong to him, as his
Wealth and Quality are manifested in those of greater Value. He desires to have
several sets of witty, facetious, and polite People to converse with, and among
them he would have some famous for Learning and universal Knowledge: For his
serious Affairs, he wishes to find Men of Parts and Experience, that should be
diligent and faithful. Those that are to wait on him he would have handy,
mannerly and discreet, of comely Aspect, and a graceful Mien: What he requires
in them besides, is a respectful Care of every Thing that is _His_, Nimbleness
without Hurry, Dispatch without Noise, and an unlimited Obedience to his Orders:
Nothing he thinks more troublesome than speaking to Servants; wherefore he will
only be attended by such, as by observing his Looks have learn'd to interpret
his Will from his slightest Motions. He loves to see an elegant Nicety in every
thing that approaches him, and in what is to be employ'd about his Person he
desires a superlative Cleanliness to be irreligiously observ'd. The chief
Officers of his Houshold he would have to be Men of Birth, Honour and
Distinction, as well as Order, Contrivance and Oeconomy; for tho' he loves to be
honour'd by every Body, and receives the Respects of the common People with Joy,
yet the Homage that is paid him by Persons of Quality is ravishing to him in a
more transcendent manner.

{#3} While thus wallowing in a Sea of Lust and Vanity, he is wholly employ'd in
provoking and indulging his Appetites, he desires the World should think him
altogether free from Pride and Sensuality, and put a favourable Construction
upon his most glaring Vices: Nay, if his Authority can purchase it, he covets to
be thought Wise, Brave, Generous, Good-natur'd, and endu'd with all the Virtues
he thinks worth having. He would have us believe that the Pomp and Luxury he is
serv'd with are as many tiresome Plagues to him; and all the Grandeur he appears
in is an ungrateful Burden, which, to his Sorrow, is inseparable from the high
Sphere he moves in; that his noble Mind, so much exalted above vulgar
Capacities, aims at higher ends, and cannot relish such worthless Enjoyments;
that the highest of his Ambition is to promote the publick Welfare, and his
greatest Pleasure to see his Country flourish, and every Body in it made happy.
These are call'd real Pleasures by the Vicious and Earthly-minded, and whoever
is able, either by his Skill or Fortune, after this refin'd manner at once to
enjoy the World, and the good Opinion of it, is counted extremely happy by all
the most fashionable part of the People.

{#4} But on the other side, most of the ancient Philosophers and grave
Moralists, especially the _Stoicks_, would not allow any Thing to be a real Good
that was liable to be taken from them by others. They wisely consider'd the
Instability of Fortune, and the Favour of Princes; the Vanity of Honour, and
popular Applause; the Precariousness of Riches, and all earthly Possessions; and
therefore placed true Happiness in the calm Serenity of a contented Mind free
from Guilt and Ambition; a Mind, that, having subdued every sensual Appetite,
despises the Smiles as well as Frowns of Fortune, and taking no Delight but in
Contemplation, desires nothing but what every Body is able to give to himself: A
Mind, that arm'd with Fortitude and Resolution has learn'd to sustain the
greatest Losses without Concern, to endure Pain without Affliction, and to bear
Injuries without Resentment. Many have own'd themselves arriv'd to this height
of Self-denial, and then, if we may believe them, they were rais'd above common
Mortals, and their Strength extended vastly beyond the pitch of their first
Nature: they could behold the Anger of Threatning Tyrants and the most imminent
Dangers without Terror, and preserv'd their Tranquillity in the midst of
Torments: Death it self they could meet with Intrepidity, and left the World
with no greater Reluctance than they had shew'd Fondness at their Entrance into
it.

{#5} These among the Ancients have always bore the greatest Sway; yet others
that were no Fools neither, have exploded those Precepts as impracticable,
call'd their Notions Romantick, and endeavour'd to prove that what these Stoicks
asserted of themselves exceeded all human Force and Possibility, and that
therefore the Virtues they boasted of could be nothing but haughty Pretence,
full of Arrogance and Hypocrisy; yet notwithstanding these Censures, the serious
Part of the World, and the generality of Wise Men that have liv'd ever since to
this Day, agree with the Stoicks in the most material Points; as that there can
be no true Felicity in what depends on Things perishable; that Peace within is
the greatest Blessing, and no Conquest like that of our Passions; that
Knowledge, Temperance, Fortitude, Humility, and other Embellishments of the Mind
are the most valuable Acquisitions; that no Man can be happy but he that is
good; and that the Virtuous are only capable of enjoying _real Pleasures_.

{#6} I expect to be ask'd why in the Fable I have call'd those Pleasures real
that are directly opposite to those which I own the wise Men of all Ages have
extoll'd as the most valuable. My Answer is, because I don't call things
Pleasures which Men say are best, but such as they seem to be most pleased with;
how can I believe that a Man's chief Delight is in the Embellishments of the
Mind, when I see him ever employ'd about and daily pursue the Pleasures that are
contrary to them? _John_ never cuts any Pudding, but just enough that you can't
say he took none; this little Bit, after much chomping and chewing you see goes
down with him like chopp'd Hay; after that he falls upon the Beef with a
voracious Appetite, and crams himself up to his Throat. Is it not provoking to
hear _John_ cry every Day that Pudding is all his Delight, and that he don't
value the Beef of a Farthing?

{#7} I could swagger about Fortitude and the Contempt of Riches as much as
_Seneca_ himself, and would undertake to write twice as much in behalf of
Poverty as ever he did, for the tenth Part of his Estate: I could teach the way
to his _Summum bonum_ as exactly as I know my way home: I could tell People that
to extricate themselves from all worldly Engagements, and to purify the Mind,
they must divest themselves of their Passions, as Men take out the Furniture
when they would clean a Room thoroughly; and I am clearly of the Opinion, that
the Malice and most severe Strokes of Fortune can do no more Injury to a Mind
thus stript of all Fears, Wishes and Inclinations, than a blind Horse can do in
an empty Barn. In the Theory of all this I am very perfect, but the Practice is
very difficult; and if you went about picking my Pocket, offer'd to take the
Victuals from before me when I am hungry, or made but the least Motion of
spitting in my Face, I dare not promise how Philosophically I should behave my
self. But that I am forced to submit to every Caprice of my unruly Nature,
you'll say, is no Argument that others are as little Masters of theirs, and
therefore I am willing to pay Adoration to Virtue wherever I can meet with it,
with a Proviso that I shall not be obliged to admit any as such, where I can see
no Self-denial, or to judge of Mens Sentiments from their Words, where I have
their Lives before me.

{#8} I have search'd through every Degree and Station of Men, and confess, that
I have found no where more Austerity of Manners, or greater Contempt of Earthly
Pleasures, than in some Religious Houses, where People freely resigning and
retiring from the World to combat themselves, have no other Business but to
subdue their Appetites. What can be a greater Evidence of perfect Chastity, and
a superlative Love to immaculate Purity in Men and Women, than that in the Prime
of their Age, when Lust is most raging, they should actually seclude themselves
from each others Company, and by a voluntary Renunciation debar themselves for
Life, not only from Uncleanness, but even the most lawful Embraces? Those that
abstain from Flesh, and often all manner of Food, one wou'd think in the right
way to conquer all Carnal Desires; and I could almost swear, that he don't
consult his Ease, who daily mauls his bare back and Shoulders with
unconscionable Stripes, and constantly roused at Midnight from his Sleep, leaves
his Bed for his Devotion. Who can despise Riches more, or shew himself less
Avaricious than he, who won't so much as touch Gold or Silver, no not with his
Feet? Or can any Mortal shew himself less Luxurious or more humble than the Man,
that making Poverty his Choice, contents himself with Scraps and Fragments, and
refuses to eat any Bread but what is bestow'd upon him by the Charity of others.

{#9} Such fair Instances of Self-denial would make me bow down to Virtue, if I
was not deterr'd and warn'd from it by so many Persons of Eminence and Learning,
who unanimously tell me that I am mistaken, and all I have seen is Farce and
Hypocrisy; that what Seraphick Love they may pretend to, there is nothing but
Discord among them, and that how Penitential the Nuns and Friars may appear in
their several Con-vents , they none of them sacrifice their darling Lusts: That
among the Women they are not all Virgins that pass for such, and that if I was
to be let into their Secrets, and examine some of their Subterraneous Privacies,
I should soon be convinced by Scenes of Horror, that some of them must have been
Mothers. That among the Men I should find Calumny, Envy and Ill-nature in the
highest degree, or else Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Impurities of a more
execrable kind than Adultery it self: And as for the Mendicant Orders, that they
differ in nothing but their Habits from other sturdy Beggars, who deceive People
with a pitiful Tone and an outward Shew of Misery, and as soon as they are out
of sight, lay by their Cant, indulge their Appetites, and enjoy one another.

{#10} If the strict Rules, and so many outward signs of Devotion observ'd among
those religious Orders, deserve such harsh Censures, we may well despair of
meeting with Virtue any where else; for if we look into the Actions of the
Antagonists and greatest Accusers of those Votaries, we shall not find so much
as the Appearance of Self-denial. The Reverend Divines of all Sects, even of the
most Reformed Churches in all Countries, take care with the _Cyclops
Evangeliphorus_ first; _ut ventri bene sit_, and afterwards, _ne quid desit iis
qu{ae} sub ventre sunt_. To these they'll desire you to add convenient Houses,
handsome Furniture, good Fires in Winter, pleasant Gardens in Summer, neat
Clothes, and Money enough to bring up their Children; Precedency in all
Companies, Respect from every body, and then as much Religion as you please. The
Things I have named are the necessary Comforts of Life, which the most Modest
are not asham'd to claim, and which they are very uneasy without. They are, 'tis
true, made of the same Mould, and have the same corrupt Nature with other Men,
born with the same Infirmities, subject to the same Passions, and liable to the
same Temptations, and therefore if they are diligent in their Calling, and can
but abstain from Murder, Adultery, Swearing, Drunkenness, and other hainous
Vices, their Lives are called unblemish'd, and their Reputations unspotted;
their Function renders them holy, and the Gratification of so many Carnal
Appetites and the Enjoyment of so much luxurious Ease notwithstanding, they may
set upon themselves what Value their Pride and Parts will allow them.

{#11} All this I have nothing against, but I see no Self-denial, without which
there can be no Virtue. Is it such a Mortification not to desire a greater Share
of worldly Blessings, than what every reasonable Man ought to be satisfy'd with?
Or is there any mighty Merit in not being flagitious, and forbearing Indecencies
that are repugnant to good Manners, and which no prudent Man would be guilty of,
tho' he had no Religion at all?

{#12} I know I shall be told, that the Reason why the Clergy are so violent in
their Resentments, when at any time they are but in the least affronted, and
shew themselves so void of all Patience when their Rights are invaded, is their
great care to preserve their Calling, their Profession from Contempt, not for
their own sakes, but to be more serviceable to others. 'Tis the same Reason that
makes 'em sollicitous about the Comforts and Conveniences of Life; for should
they suffer themselves to be insulted over, be content with a coarser Diet, and
wear more ordinary Clothes than other People, the Multitude, who judge from
outward Appearances, would be apt to think that the Clergy was no more the
immediate Care of Providence than other Folks, and so not only undervalue their
Persons, but despise likewise all the Reproofs and Instructions that came from
'em. This is an admirable Plea, and as it is much made use of, I'll try the
Worth of it.

{#13} I am not of the Learned Dr. _Echard_'s Opinion, that Poverty is one of
those things that bring the Clergy into Contempt, any further than as it may be
an Occasion of discovering their blind side: For when Men are always struggling
with their low Condition, and are unable to bear the Burthen of it without
Reluctancy, it is then they shew how uneasy their Poverty sits upon them, how
glad they would be to have their Circumstances meliorated, and what a real value
they have for the good things of this World. He that harangues on the Contempt
of Riches, and the Vanity of Earthly Enjoyments, in a rusty threadbare Gown,
because he has no other, and would wear his old greasy Hat no longer if any body
would give him a better; that drinks Small-beer at Home with a heavy
Countenance, but leaps at a Glass of Wine if he can catch it Abroad; that with
little Appetite feeds upon his own coarse Mess, but falls to greedily where he
can please his Palate, and expresses an uncommon Joy at an Invitation to a
splendid Dinner: 'Tis he that is despised, not because he is Poor, but because
he knows not how to be so with that Content and Resignation which he preaches to
others, and so discovers his Inclinations to be contrary to his Doctrine. But
when a Man from the greatness of his Soul (or an obstinate Vanity, which will do
as well) resolving to subdue his Appetites in good earnest, refuses all the
Offers of Ease and Luxury that can be made to him, and embracing a voluntary
Poverty with Chearfulness, rejects whatever may gratify the Senses, and actually
sacrifices all his Passions to his Pride in acting this Part, the Vulgar, far
from contemning, will be ready to deify and adore him. How famous have the
_Cynick_ Philosophers made themselves, only by refusing to dissimulate and make
use of Superfluities? Did not the most Ambitious Monarch the World ever bore,
condescend to visit _Diogenes_ in his Tub, and return to a study'd Incivility,
the highest Compliment a Man of his Pride was able to make?

{#14} Mankind are very willing to take one anothers Word, when they see some
Circumstances that corroborate what is told them; but when our Actions directly
contradict what we say, it is counted Impudence to desire Belief. If a jolly
hale Fellow with glowing Cheeks and warm Hands, newly return'd from some smart
Exercise, or else the cold Bath, tells us in frosty Weather, that he cares not
for the Fire, we are easily induced to believe him, especially if he actually
turns from it, and we know by his Circumstances that he wants neither Fuel nor
Clothes: but if we should hear the same from the Mouth of a poor starv'd Wretch,
with swell'd Hands, and a livid Countenance, in a thin ragged Garment, we should
not believe a Word of what he said, especially if we saw him shaking and
shivering, creep toward the Sunny Bank; and we would conclude, let him say what
he could, that warm Clothes and a good Fire would be very acceptable to him. The
Application is easy, and therefore if there be any Clergy upon Earth that would
be thought not to care for the World, and to value the Soul above the Body, let
them only forbear shewing a greater concern for their Sensual Pleasures than
they generally do for their Spiritual ones, and they may rest satisfy'd, that no
Poverty, while they bear it with Fortitude, will ever bring them into Contempt,
how mean soever their Circumstances may be.

{#15} Let us suppose a Pastor that has a little Flock entrusted to him, of which
he is very careful: He preaches, visits, exhorts, reproves among his People with
Zeal and Prudence, and does them all the kind Offices that lie in his Power to
make them happy. There is no doubt but those under his Care must be very much
oblig'd to him. Now we'll suppose once more, that this good Man by the help of a
little Self-denial, is contented to live upon half his Income, accepting only of
Twenty Pounds a Year instead of Forty, which he could claim; and moreover that
he loves his Parishioners so well, that he will never leave them for any
Preferment whatever, no not a Bishoprick, tho' it be offer'd. I can't see but
all this might be an easy task to a Man who professes Mortification, and has no
Value for worldly Pleasures; yet such a disinterested Divine I dare promise,
notwithstanding the great degeneracy of Mankind will be lov'd, esteem'd and have
every Body's good Word; nay I would swear, that tho' he should yet further exert
himself, give above half of his small Revenue to the Poor, live upon nothing but
Oatmeal and Water, lie upon Straw, and wear the coarsest Cloth that could be
made, his mean way of Living would never be reflected on, or be a Disparagement
either to himself or the Order he belong'd to; but that on the contrary his
Poverty would never be mentioned but to his Glory, as long as his Memory should
last.

{#16} But (says a charitable young Gentlewoman) tho' you have the Heart to
starve your Parson, have you no Bowels of Compassion for his Wife and Children?
Pray what must remain of Forty Pounds a Year after it has been twice so
unmercifully split? Or would you have the poor Woman and the innocent Babes
likewise live upon Oatmeal and Water, and lie upon Straw, you unconscionable
Wretch, with all your Suppositions and Self-denials? Nay, is it possible, tho'
they should all live at your own murd'ring rate, that less than Ten Pounds a
Year could maintain a Family?——Don't be in a Passion, good Mrs. _Abigail_, I
have a greater regard for your Sex than to prescribe such a lean Diet to married
Men; but I confess I forgot the Wives and Children: The main Reason was, because
I thought poor Priests could have no occasion for them. Who could imagine that
the Parson who is to teach others by Example as well as Precept, was not able to
withstand those Desires which the wicked World it self calls unreasonable? What
is the Reason when a Prentice marries before he is out of his Time, that unless
he meets with a good Fortune, all his Relations are angry with him, and every
body blames him? Nothing else but because at that time he has no Money at his
disposal, and being bound to his Master's Service, has no leisure, and perhaps
little Capacity to provide for a Family. What must we say to a Parson that has
Twenty, or if you will Forty Pounds a Year, that being bound more strictly to
all the Services a Parish and his Duty require, has little time and generally
much less Ability to get any more? Is it not very unreasonable he should Marry?
But why should a sober young Man, who is guilty of no Vice, be debarr'd from
lawful Enjoyments? Right; Marriage is lawful, and so is a Coach; but what is
that to People that have not Money enough to keep one? If he must have a Wife,
let him look out for one with Money, or wait for a greater Benefice or something
else to maintain her handsomely, and bear all incident Charges. But no body that
has any thing her self will have him, and he can't stay: He has a very good
Stomach, and all the Symptoms of Health; 'tis not every body that can live
without a Woman; 'tis better to marry than burn. ——What a World of Self-denial
is here? The sober young Man is very willing to be Virtuous, but you must not
cross his Inclinations; he promises never to be a Deer-stealer, upon Condition
that he shall have Venison of his own, and no body must doubt but that if it
came to the Push, he is qualify'd to suffer Martyrdom, tho' he owns that he has
not Strength enough, patiently to bear a scratch'd Finger.

{#17} When we see so many of the Clergy, to indulge their Lust, a brutish
Appetite, run themselves after this manner upon an inevitable Poverty, which
unless they could bear it with greater Fortitude than they discover in all their
Actions, must of necessity make them contemptible to all the World, what Credit
must we give them, when they pretend that they conform themselves to the World,
not because they take delight in the several Decencies, Conveniences, and
Ornaments of it, but only to preserve their Function from Contempt, in order to
be more useful to others? Have we not reason to believe, that what they say is
full of Hypocrisy and Falshood, and that Concupiscence is not the only Appetite
they want to gratify; that the haughty Airs and quick Sense of Injuries, the
curious Elegance in Dress, and Niceness of Palate, to be observ'd in most of
them that are able to shew them, are the Results of Pride and Luxury in them as
they, are in other People, and that the Clergy are not possess'd of more
intrinsick Virtue than any other Profession?

{#18} I am afraid that by this time I have given many of my Readers a real
Displeasure, by dwelling so long upon the Reality of Pleasure; but I can't help
it, there is one thing comes into my Head to corroborate what I have urg'd
already, which I can't forbear mentioning: It is this: Those who govern others
throughout the World, are at least as Wise as the People that are govern'd by
them, generally speaking: If for this reason we would take Pattern from our
Superiors, we have but to cast our Eyes on all the Courts and Governments in the
Universe, and we shall soon perceive from the Actions of the Great Ones, which
Opinion they side with, and what Pleasures those in the highest Stations of all
seem to be most fond of: For if it be allowable at all to judge of People's
Inclinations from their Manner of Living, none can be less injur'd by it than
those who are the most at Liberty to do as they please.

{#19} If the great ones of the Clergy as well as the Laity of any Country
whatever, had no value for earthly Pleasures, and did not endeavour to gratify
their Appetites, why are Envy and Revenge so raging among them, and all the
other Passions improv'd and refin'd upon in Courts of Princes more than any
where else, and why are their Repasts, their Recreations, and whole manner of
Living always such as are approv'd of, coveted, and imitated by the most sensual
People of that same Country? If despising all visible Decorations they were only
in Love with the Embellishments of the Mind, why should they borrow so many of
the Implements, and make use of the most darling Toys of the Luxurious? Why
should a Lord-Treasurer, or a Bishop, or even the Grand Signior, or the Pope of
_Rome_, to be good and virtuous, and endeavour the Conquest of his Passions,
have occasion for greater Revenues, richer Furniture, or a more numerous
Attendance, as to Personal Service, than a private Man? What Virtue is it the
Exercise of which requires so much Pomp and Superfluity, as are to be seen by
all Men in Power? A Man has as much Opportunity to practise Temperance, that has
but one Dish at a Meal, as he that is constantly serv'd with three Courses and a
dozen Dishes in each: One may exercise as much Patience, and be as full of
Self-denial on a few Flocks, without Curtains or Tester, as in a Velvet Bed that
is Sixteen Foot high. The Virtuous Possessions of the Mind are neither Charge
nor Burden: A Man may bear Misfortunes with Fortitude in a Garret, forgive
Injuries a-foot, and be Chaste, tho' he has not a Shirt to his Back; and
therefore I shall never believe, but that an indifferent Skuller, if he was
entrusted with it, might carry all the Learning and Religion that one Man can
contain, as well as a Barge with Six Oars, especially if it was but to cross
from _Lambeth_ to _Westminster_; or that Humility is so ponderous a Virtue, that
it requires six Horses to draw it.

{#20} To say that Men not being so easily govern'd by their Equals as by their
Superiors, it is necessary that to keep the multitude in awe, those who rule
over us should excel others in outward Appearance, and consequently that all in
high Stations should have Badges of Honour, and Ensigns of Power to be
distinguish'd from the Vulgar, is a frivolous Objection. This in the first Place
can only be of use to poor Princes, and weak and precarious Governments, that
being actually unable to maintain the publick Peace, are obliged with a Pageant
Shew to make up what they want in real Power: So the Governor of _Batavia_ in
the _East-Indies_ is forced to keep up a Grandeur, and live in a Magnificence
above his Quality, to strike a Terror in the Natives of _Java_, who, if they had
Skill and Conduct, are strong enough to destroy ten times the number of their
Masters; but great Princes and States that keep large Fleets at Sea, and
numerous Armies in the Field, have no Occasion for such Stratagems; for what
makes 'em formidable Abroad, will never fail to be their Security at Home.
Secondly, what must protect the Lives and Wealth of People from the Attempts of
wicked Men in all Societies, is the Severity of the Laws, and diligent
Administration of impartial Justice. Theft, House-breaking and Murther are not
to be prevented by the Scarlet Gowns of the Aldermen, the Gold Chains of the
Sheriffs, the fine Trappings of their Horses, or any gaudy Shew whatever: Those
pageant Ornaments are beneficial another way; they are eloquent Lectures to
Prentices, and the use of them is to animate not to deter: but Men of abandon'd
Principles must be aw'd by rugged Officers, strong Prisons, watchful Jailors,
the Hangman and the Gallows. If _London_ was to be one Week destitute of
Constables and Watchmen to guard the Houses a-nights, half the Bankers would be
ruin'd in that time, and if my Lord Mayor had nothing to defend himself but his
great two-handed Sword, the huge Cap of Maintenance, and his gilded Mace, he
would soon be strip'd in the very Streets of the City of all his Finery in his
stately Coach.

{#21} But let us grant that the Eyes of the Mobility are to be dazzled with a
gaudy outside; if Virtue was the chief Delight of great Men, why should their
Extravagance be extended to Things not understood by the Mob, and wholly removed
from publick View, I mean their private Diversions, the Pomp and Luxury of the
Dining-room and the Bed-chamber, and the Curiosities of the Closet? Few of the
Vulgar know that there is Wine of a Guinea the Bottle, that Birds no bigger than
Larks are often sold for half a Guinea a-piece, or that a single Picture may be
worth several thousand Pounds: Besides, is it to be imagin'd, that unless it was
to please their own Appetites Men should put themselves to such vast Expences
for a Political Shew, and be so sollicitous to gain the Esteem of those whom
they so much despise in every thing else? If we allow that the Splendor and all
the Elegancy of a Court are insipid, and only tiresome to the Prince himself,
and are altogether made use of to preserve Royal Majesty from Contempt, can we
say the same of half a dozen illegitimate Children, most of them the Offspring
of Adultery by the same Majesty, got, educated, and made Princes at the Expence
of the Nation? Therefore it is evident, that this awing of the Multitude by a
distinguish'd manner of living, is only a Cloke and Pretence, under which great
Men would shelter their Vanity, and indulge every Appetite about them without
Reproach.

{#22} A Burgomaster of _Amsterdam_ in his plain, black Suit, follow'd perhaps by
one Footman, is fully as much respected and better obey'd than a Lord Mayor of
_London_ with all his splendid Equipage and great Train of Attendance. Where
there is a real Power it is ridiculous to think that any Temperance or Austerity
of Life should ever render the Person in whom that Power is lodg'd contemptible
in his Office, from an Emperor to the Beadle of a Parish. _Cato_ in his
Government of _Spain_, in which he acquitted himself with so much Glory, had
only three Servants to attend him; do we hear that any of his Orders were ever
slighted for this, notwithstanding that he lov'd his Bottle? And when that great
Man march'd on Foot thro' the scorching Sands of _Libya_, and parch'd up with
Thirst, refus'd to touch the Water that was brought him, before all his Soldiers
had drank, do we ever read that this Heroick Forbearance weakned his Authority,
or lessen'd him in the Esteem of his Army? But what need we go so far off? There
has not these many Ages been a Prince less inclin'd to Pomp and Luxury than the†
present King of _Sweden_, who enamour'd with the Title of _Hero_, has not only
sacrific'd the Lives of his Subjects, and Welfare of his Dominions, but (what is
more uncommon in Sovereigns) his own Ease, and all the Comforts of Life, to an
implacable Spirit of Revenge; yet he is obey'd to the Ruin of his People, in
obstinately maintaining a War that has almost utterly destroy'd his Kingdom.

{#23} Thus I have prov'd, that the real Pleasures of all Men in Nature are
worldly and sensual, if we judge from their Practice; I say all Men _in Nature_,
because Devout Christians, who alone are to be excepted here, being regenerated,
and preternaturally assisted by the Divine Grace, cannot be said to be in
Nature. How strange it is, that they should all so unanimously deny it! Ask not
only the Divines and Moralists of every Nation, but likewise all that are rich
and powerful, about real Pleasure, and they'll tell you, with the _Stoicks_ that
there can be no true Felicity in Things Mundane and Corruptible: but then look
upon their Lives, and you will find they take delight in no other.

{#24} What must we do in this Dilemma? Shall we be so uncharitable, as judging
from Mens Actions to say, That all the World prevaricates, and that this is not
their Opinion, let them talk what they will? Or shall we be so silly, as relying
on what they say, to think them sincere in their Sentiments, and so not believe
our own Eyes? Or shall we rather endeavour to believe our selves and them too,
and say with _Montagne_, that they imagine, and are fully persuaded, that they
believe what yet they do not believe? These are his Words; _Some impose on the
World, and would be thought to believe what they really don't: but much the
greater number impose upon themselves, not considering nor thoroughly
apprehending what it is to believe._ But this is making all Mankind either Fools
or Impostors, which to avoid, there is nothing left us, but to say what Mr.
_Bayle_ has endeavour'd to prove at large in his Reflexions on Comets: That Man
is so unaccountable a Creature as to act most commonly against his Principle;
and this is so far from being injurious, that it is a Compliment to Human
Nature, for we must say either this or worse.

{#25} This Contradiction in the Frame of Man is the Reason that the Theory of
Virtue is so well understood, and the Practice of it so rarely to be met with.
If you ask me where to look for those beautiful shining Qualities of Prime
Ministers, and the great Favourites of Princes that are so finely painted in
Dedications, Addresses, Epitaphs, Funeral Sermons and Inscriptions, I answer
_There_, and no where else. Where would you look for the Excellency of a Statue,
but in that Part which you see of it? 'Tis the Polish'd Outside only that has
the Skill and Labour of the Sculptor to boast of; what's out of sight is
untouch'd. Would you break the Head or cut open the Breast to look for the
Brains or the Heart, you'd only shew your Ignorance, and destroy the
Workmanship. This has often made me compare the Virtues of great Men to your
large _China_ Jars: they make a fine Shew, and are Ornamental even to a Chimney;
one would by the Bulk they appear in, and the Value that is set upon 'em, think
they might be very useful, but look into a thousand of them, and you'll find
nothing in them but Dust and Cobwebs.
