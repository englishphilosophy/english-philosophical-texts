{#1} IN the Education of _Youth,_ in order to their getting of a _Livelihood_
when they shall be arrived at _Maturity,_ most People look out for some
warrantable Employment or other, of which there are whole _Bodies_ or
_Companies,_ in every large _Society of Men._ By this means all _Arts_ and
_Sciences,_ as well as _Trades_ and _Handicrafts,_ are perpetuated in the
_Commonwealth,_ as long as they are found useful; the Young ones that are daily
brought up to 'em, continually supplying the loss of the Old Ones that die. But
some of these Employments being vastly more Creditable than others, according to
the great difference of the Charges required to set up in each of them, all
prudent _Parents_ in the Choice of them chiefly consult their own _Abilities_
and the _Circumstances_ they are in. A Man that gives Three or Four Hundred
Pounds with his _Son_ to a great _Merchant,_ and has not Two or Three Thousand
Pounds to spare against he is out of his Time to begin the World with, is much
to blame not to have brought his _Child_ up to something that might be follow'd
with less _Money._

{#2} There are abundance of _Men_ of a _Genteel_ Education, that have but very
small _Revenues,_ and yet are forced, by their Reputable _Callings,_ to make a
greater _Figure_ than ordinary People of twice their _Income._ If these have any
_Children,_ it often happens, that as their _Indigence_ renders them incapable
of bringing them up to Creditable _Occupations,_ so their Pride makes 'em
unwilling to put them out to any of the mean laborious _Trades,_ and then, in
hopes either of an Alteration in their _Fortune,_ or that some Friends, or
favourable _Opportunity_ shall offer, they from time to time put off the
disposing of them, 'till insensibly they come to be of _Age,_ and are at last
brought up to nothing. Whether this Neglect be more barbarous to the Children,
or prejudicial to the Society, I shall not determine. At _Athens_ all _Children_
were forced to assist their _Parents,_ if they came to _Want:_ But _Solon_ made
a Law, that no _Son_ should be oblig'd to relieve his _Father,_ who had not bred
him up to any _Calling._

{#3} Some Parents put out their Sons to good _Trades_ very suitable to their
then present Abilities, but happen to dy, or fail in the World, before their
Children have finish'd their _Apprenticeships,_ or are made fit for the
_Business_ they are to follow: A great many Young Men again on the other hand
are handsomely provided for and set up for themselves, that yet (some for want
of _Industry_ or else a sufficient _Knowledge_ in their _Callings,_ others by
indulging their _Pleasures,_ and some few by _Misfortunes)_ are reduced to
Poverty, and altogether unable to maintain themselves by the Business they were
brought up to. It is impossible but that the Neglects, Mismanagements and
Misfortunes I named, must very frequently happen in Populous Places, and
consequently great Numbers of People be daily flung unprovided for into the wide
World, how Rich and Potent a Commonwealth may be, or what Care soever a
Government may take to hinder it. How must these People be disposed of? The Sea,
I know, and Armies, which the World is seldom without, will take off some. Those
that are honest Drudges, and of a laborious Temper, will become _Journey-men_ to
the Trades they are of, or enter into some other Service: Such of them as
study'd and were sent to the University, may become Schoolmasters, Tutors, and
some few of them get into some Office or other: But what must become of the
_Lazy_ that care for no manner of working, and the _Fickle_ that hate to be
confin'd to any Thing?

{#4} Those that ever took Delight in Plays and Romances, and have a spice of
Gentility, will, in all probability, throw their Eyes upon the _Stage,_ and if
they have a good Elocution with tolerable Mien, turn _Actors._ Some that love
their Bellies above any thing else, if they have a good Palate, and a little
Knack at Cookery, will strive to get in with _Gluttons_ and _Epicures,_ learn to
cringe and bear all manner of Usage, and so turn _Parasites,_ ever flattering
the Master, and making Mischief among the rest of the _Family._ Others, who by
their own and Companions Lewdness judge of People's Incontinence, will naturally
fall to Intriguing, and endeavour to live by Pimping for such as either want
Leisure or Address to speak for themselves. Those of the most abandon'd
Principles of all, if they are sly and dextrous, turn Sharpers, Pick-pockets, or
Coiners, if their Skill and Ingenuity give them leave. Others again, that have
observ'd the Credulity of simple Women, and other foolish People, if they have
Impudence and a little Cunning, either set up for Doctors, or else pretend to
tell Fortunes; and every one turning the Vices and Frailties of others to his
own Advantage, endeavours to pick up a Living the easiest and shortest way his
Talent and Abilities will let him.

{#5} These are certainly the Bane of Civil Society; but they are Fools, who not
considering what has been said, storm at the Remisness of the Laws that suffer
them to live, while wise Men content themselves with taking all imaginable Care
not to be circumvented by them, without quarrelling at what no human Prudence
can prevent.
