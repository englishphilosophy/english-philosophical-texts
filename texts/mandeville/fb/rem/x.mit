{#1} THIS perhaps might be done where People are contented to be poor and hardy;
but if they would likewise enjoy their Ease and the Comforts of the World, and
be at once an opulent, potent, and flourishing, as well as a Warlike Nation, it
is utterly impossible. I have heard People speak of the mighty Figure the
_Spartans_ made above all the Commonwealths of _Greece,_ notwithstanding their
uncommon Frugality and other exemplary Virtues. But certainly there never was a
Nation whose Greatness was more empty than theirs: The Splendor they lived in
was inferior to that of a Theatre, and the only thing they could be proud of,
was, that they enjoy'd nothing. They were indeed both feared and esteemed
Abroad: They were so famed for Valour and Skill in Martial Affairs, that their
Neighbours did not only court their Friendship and Assistance in their Wars, but
were satisfied and thought themselves sure of the Victory, if they could but get
a _Spartan_ General to command their Armies. But then their Discipline was so
rigid, and their manner of living so Austere and void of all Comfort, that the
most temperate Man among us would refuse to submit to the Harshness of such
uncouth Laws. There was a perfect Equality among them: Gold and Silver Coin were
cried down; their current Money was made of Iron, to render it of a great Bulk
and little Worth: To lay up twenty or thirty Pounds, required a pretty large
Chamber, and to remove it nothing less than a Yoke of Oxen. Another Remedy, they
had against Luxury, was, that they were obliged to eat in common of the same
Meat, and they so little allowed any body to Dine or Sup by himself at home,
that _Agis,_ one of their Kings, having vanquished the _Athenians,_ and sending
for his Commons at his return home (because he desired privately to eat with his
Queen) was refused by the _Polemarchi._

{#2} In training up their Youth, their chief Care, says _Plutarch,_ was to make
them good Subjects, to fit them to endure the Fatigues of long and tedious
Marches, and never to return without Victory from the Field. When they were
twelve Years old, they lodg'd in little Bands, upon Beds made of the Rushes
which grew by the Banks of the River _Eurotas;_ and because their Points were
sharp, they were to break them off with their Hands without a Knife: If it were
a hard Winter, they mingled some Thistle-down with their Rushes to keep them
warm (see _Plutarch_ in the Life of _Lycurgus_.) From all these Circumstances it
is plain, that no Nation on Earth was less effeminate; but being debarred from
all the Comforts of Life, they could have nothing for their Pains but the Glory
of being a Warlike People inured to Toils and Hardships, which was a Happiness
that few People would have cared for upon the same Terms: And though they had
been Masters of the World, as long as they enjoyed no more of it, _Englishmen_
would hardly have envy'd them their Greatness. What Men want now-a-days has
sufficiently been shewn in Remark (O.) where I have treated of real Pleasures.
