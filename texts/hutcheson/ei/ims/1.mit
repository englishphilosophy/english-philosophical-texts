£3 _Concerning the Character of Virtue, _agreeable to Truth or Reason_._ £3

{#1} SINCE Reason is understood to denote our _Power of finding out true
Propositions_, Reasonableness must denote the same thing, with _Conformity to
true Propositions, or to Truth_.

{#2} ^Reasonableness^ in an Action is a very common Expression, but yet upon
inquiry, it will appear very confused, whether we suppose it the Motive to
_Election_, or the Quality determining _Approbation_.

{#3} #Conformity to Truth examined.# ^There^ is one sort of _Conformity to
Truth_ which neither determines to the one or the other; _viz._ that _Conformity
which is between every true Proposition and its Object_. This sort of Conformity
can never make us _chuse_ or _approve_ one Action more than its contrary, for it
is found in all Actions alike: Whatever _Attribute_ can be ascribed to a
_generous kind Action_, the _contrary Attribute_ may as _truly_ be ascribed to a
_selfish cruel Action_: Both Propositions are equally _true_, and the two
contrary Actions, the Objects of the two _Truths_ are equally _conformable_ to
their several Truths, with that sort of _Conformity_ which is between a Truth
and its Object. This _Conformity_ then cannot make a Difference among Actions,
or recommend one more than another either to _Election_ or _Approbation_, since
any Man may make as many Truths about Villany, as about Heroism, by ascribing to
it contrary _Attributes_.

{#4} ^For^ Instance, these are _Truths_ concerning the _Preservation_ of
_Property_. "It tends to the Happiness of human Society: It incourages Industry:
It shall be rewarded by God." These are also _Truths_ concerning _Robbery_. "It
disturbs Society: It discourages Industry: It shall be punished by God." The
former _three Truths_ have the _Preservation of Property_ for their _Object_:
the _latter three_ have _Robbery_. And each Class of Truths hath that sort of
_Conformity_ to its Objects, which is common to all Truths with their Objects.
The _moral Difference_ cannot therefore depend upon this _Conformity_, which is
common to both.

{#5} ^The^ _Number_ of Truths in both cases may be plainly the same; so that a
good Action cannot be supposed to agree to _more Truths_ than an evil one, nor
can an evil Action be disagreeable to any _Truth_ or _Compages of Truths_ made
about it; for whatever Propositions do not agree with their Objects are not
Truths.

{#6} ^If^ _Reasonableness_, the Character of Virtue, denote some other sort of
_Conformity_ to Truth, it were to be wished that these Gentlemen, who make it
the original Idea of moral Good, antecedent to any _Sense_ or _Affections_,
would explain it, and shew how it determines us antecedently to a Sense, either
to _Election_ or _Approbation_.

{#7} ^They^ tell us, "we must have some _Standard_antecedently to all _Sense_ or
_Affections_, since we judge even of our Senses and Affections themselves, and
approve or disapprove them: This Standard must be our _Reason_, Conformity to
which must be the original Idea of moral Good."

{#8} #Reasons either justifying or exciting.# ^But^ what is this _Conformity of
Actions to Reason_? When we ask the Reason of an Action we sometimes mean,
"_What Truth shews a Quality in the Action, exciting the Agent to do it?_" Thus,
why does a _Luxurious_ Man pursue _Wealth_? The Reason is given by this Truth,
"Wealth is useful to purchase Pleasures." Sometimes for a Reason of Actions we
shew the _Truth expressing a Quality, engaging our Approbation_. Thus the
_Reason_ of hazarding Life in just War, is, that "it tends to preserve our
honest Countrymen, or evidences publick Spirit:" The _Reason_ for _Temperance_,
and against _Luxury_ is given thus, "Luxury evidences a selfish base Temper."
The former sort of Reasons we will call _exciting_, and the latter
_justifying_.[n1] Now we shall find that all _exciting Reasons_ pre-suppose
_Instincts_ and _Affections_; and the _justifying_ pre-suppose a _Moral Sense._

{#9} #Exciting Reasons suppose Affections.# ^As^ to _exciting Reasons_, in every
calm rational Action some _end_ is desired or intended; no end can be intended
or desired previously to some one of these Classes of Affections, _Self‐Love_,
_Self‐Hatred_, or desire of private Misery, (if this be possible) _Benevolence_
toward others, or _Malice_: All Affections are included under these; no _end_can
be previous to them all; there can therefore be no _exciting Reason_ previous to
_Affection_.

{#10} ^We^ have indeed many confused Harangues on this Subject, telling us, "We
have two Principles of Action, _Reason_, and _Affection_ or _Passion_: the
_former_ in common with Angels, the _latter_ with Brutes: No Action is wise, or
good, or reasonable, to which we are not excited by _Reason_, as distinct from
all _Affections_; or, if any such Actions as flow from _Affections_ be good, it
is only by _chance_, or _materially_ and not _formally_." As if indeed _Reason_,
or the Knowledge of the Relations of things, could excite to Action when we
proposed no _End_, or as if _Ends_ could be intended without _Desire or
Affection_.

{#11} ^Writers^ on these Subjects should remember the common Divisions of the
Faculties of the Soul. That there is 1. _Reason_ presenting the natures and
relations of things, antecedently to any Act of _Will_ or _Desire_: 2. The
_Will_, or $Appetitus Rationalis$, or the disposition of the Soul to pursue what
is presented as good, and to shun Evil. Were there no other Power in the Soul,
than that of mere contemplation, there would be no _Affection_, _Volition_,
_Desire_, _Action_. Nay without some motion of _Will_ no Man would voluntarily
persevere in Contemplation. There must be a _Desire_ of Knowledge, and of the
Pleasure which attends it: this too is an Act of _Willing_. Both these Powers
are by the Antients included under the $Δόγος$ or $λογιχόν μέρος$. Below these
they place two other powers dependent on the Body, the $Sensus$, and the
$Appetitus Sensitivus$, in which they place the particular Passions: the former
answers to the _Understanding_, and the latter to the _Will_. But the Will is
forgot of late, and some ascribe to the _Intellect_, not only _Contemplation_ or
Knowledge, but _Choice_, _Desire_, _Prosecuting_, _Loving_. Nay some are grown
so ingenious in uniting the Powers of the Soul, that _contemplating with
Pleasure_, Symmetry and Proportion, an Act of the _Intellect_ as they plead, is
the same thing with _Goodwill_ or the virtuous _Desire_ of publick Happiness.

{#12} #No exciting Reasons for ultimate Ends.# ^But^ are there not also exciting
Reasons, even previous to any end, moving us to propose one end rather than
another? To this =_Aristotle_= long ago answered, "that there are _ultimate
Ends_ desired without a view to any thing else, and _subordinate Ends_ or
Objects desired with a view to something else." To _subordinate Ends_ those
_Reasons_ or _Truths_ excite, which shew them to be conducive to the _ultimate
End_, and shew _one Object_ to be more effectual than another: thus _subordinate
Ends_ may be called _reasonable_. But as to the _ultimate Ends_, to suppose
_exciting Reasons_ for them, would infer, that there is no _ultimate End_, but
that we desire one thing for another in an infinite Series.

{#13} ^Thus^ ask a Being who desires _private Happiness_, or has _Self‐Love_
"what Reason excites him to desire Wealth?" He will give this Reason, that
"Wealth tends to procure Pleasure and Ease." Ask his Reason for desiring
Pleasure or Happiness: One cannot imagine what Proposition he could assign as
his _exciting Reason_. This Proposition is indeed true, "There is an _Instinct_
or _Desire_ fixed in his Nature, determining him to pursue his Happiness;" but
it is not this _Reflection_ on his own Nature, or this _Proposition_ which
excites or determines him, but the _Instinct itself_. This is a Truth,
"_Rhubarb_ strengthens the Stomach:" But it is not a _Proposition_ which
strengthens the Stomach, but the _Quality_ in that Medicine. The Effect is not
produced by _Propositions_ shewing the _Cause_, but by the _Cause_ itself.

{#14} ^In^ like manner, what _Reason_ can a benevolent Being give, as exciting
him to hazard his Life in just War? This perhaps, "such Conduct tends to the
Happiness of his Country." Ask him, "why he serves his Country?" he will say,
"His Country is a very valuable Part of Mankind." Why does he study the
Happiness of Mankind? If his Affections be really _disinterested_, he can give
no _exciting Reasons_ for it: The Happiness of Mankind in general, or of any
valuable Part of it, is an _ultimate End_ to that Series of Desires.

{#15} #Men have many ultimate Ends.# ^We^ may transiently observe one Mistake
which many fall into, who in their Philosophical Inquiries have learned to form
very _abstract general Ideas_: They suppose, because they have formed some
Conception of an _infinite Good_, or _greatest possible Aggregate_, or _Sum of
Happiness_, under which all _particular Pleasures_ may be included; that there
is also some _one great ultimate End_, with a view to which every _particular
Object_ is desired; whereas, in truth, each _particular Pleasure_ is desired
without farther view, as an ultimate End in the _selfish Desires_. It is true,
the _Prospect_ of a greater inconsistent Pleasure may surmount or stop this
Desire; so may the _Fear_ of a prepollent Evil. But this does not prove, that
"all Men have formed Ideas of _infinite Good_, or _greatest possible Aggregate_,
or that they have any _Instinct_ or _Desire_, without an Idea of its Object."
Just so in the _benevolent_ Affections, the Happiness of any one Person is an
_ultimate End_, desired with no farther view: And yet the observing its
_Inconsistency_ with the Happiness of another more beloved, or with the
Happiness of _many_, though each one of them were but equally beloved, may
overcome the former Desire. Yet this will not prove, that in each _kind Action_
Men do form the abstract Conception of _all Mankind_, or the _System of
Rationals_. The forming such large Conceptions is indeed useful, that so we may
gratify either our _Self‐Love_ or _kind Affections_ in the fullest manner, as
far as our Power extends; and may not content our selves with smaller Degrees
either of _private_ or _publick Good_, while greater are in our power: But when
we have formed these _Conceptions_, we do not serve the _Individual_ only from
Love to the _Species_, no more than we desire _Grapes_ with an Intention of the
_greatest Aggregate_ of Happiness, or from an Apprehension that they make a Part
of the _General sum_ of our Happiness. These Conceptions only serve to suggest
_greater Ends_ than would occur to us without Reflection; and by the
_Prepollency_ of one Desire toward the _greater Good_, either private or
publick, to stop the Desire toward the _smaller Good_, when it appears
inconsistent with the greater.

{#16} #The common Reasons examined.# ^Let^ us examine the Truths assigned as
_exciting_ to the Pursuit of publick Good, even by those, who, though they allow
_disinterested Affections_, and a _moral Sense_, yet suppose something
_reasonable_ in it antecedently. They assign such as these "publick Good is the
End proposed by the ^Deity^." Then what _Reason_ excites Men to concur with the
^Deity^? Is it this, "Concurring with the ^Deity^ will make the Agent _happy_?"
This is an _exciting Reason_ indeed, but plainly supposes _Self‐Love_: And let
any one assign the _exciting Reason_ to the Desire of Happiness. Is the Reason
exciting to concur with the ^Deity^ this, "The ^Deity^ is our _Benefactor_?"
Then what _Reason excites_ to concur with Benefactors? Here we must recur to an
_Instinct_. Is it this Truth, "The divine Ends are _reasonable Ends_?" Then what
means the Word _reasonable_? Does it mean, that "the Deity has _Reasons_
exciting him to promote the publick Good?" What are these _Reasons_? Why,
perhaps "we do not know them particularly, but in general are sure that the
^Deity^ has Reasons for them." Then the Question recurs, What Reason excites us
to _implicit Concurrence_ with the Ends of the ^Deity^? The Reasons which excite
_one Nature_ may not excite another: The Tendency of an Action to the _Happiness
of one Agent_ may excite him, but will not excite another _Agent_ to concur,
unless there appears a like Tendency to the Happiness of that _other_. They may
say, "they are sure the _divine Ends_ are good." What means _Goodness_? Is it
_moral_ or _natural_? If the divine Ends be _natural Good_, i.e. _pleasant_, or
the _Cause of Pleasure_, to whom is this _Pleasure_? If to the ^Deity^, then why
do we study the Happiness or the pleasing of the ^Deity^? What _Reason_ excites
us? All the possible Reasons must either presuppose some _Affection_, if they
are exciting; or some _moral Sense_, if they are justifying.—Is the divine End
naturally good to us? This is an exciting Reason, but supposes _Self‐Love_. If
we say the divine Ends are _morally Good_, we are just where we began. What is
_moral Goodness_? _Conformity to Reason_. What are the _Reasons exciting_ or
_justifying_?

{#17} ^If^ any alledge as the Reason _exciting_ us to pursue publick Good, this
Truth, that "the Happiness of a _System_, a _Thousand_, or a _Million_, is a
greater Quantity of Happiness than that of _one Person_: and consequently, if
Men desire Happiness, they must have stronger Desires toward the _greater Sum_,
than toward the _less_." This Reason still supposes an _Instinct toward
Happiness_ as previous to it: And again, To _whom_ is the Happiness of a System
a greater Happiness? To one _Individual_, or to the _System_? If to the
Individual, then his Reason exciting his Desire of a _happy System_ supposes
_Self‐Love_: If to the _System_, then what _Reason_ can excite to desire the
greater _Happiness of a System_, or any _Happiness_ to be in the Possession of
_others_? None surely which does not presuppose _publick Affections_. Without
such _Affections_ this Truth, "that an hundred Felicities is a greater Sum than
one Felicity," will no more excite to study the Happiness of the _Hundred_, than
this Truth, "an hundred Stones are greater than one," will excite a Man, who has
no _desire of Heaps_, to cast them together.

{#18} ^The^ same may be observed concerning that _Proposition_, assigned by some
as the _ultimate Reason_ both _exciting_ to, and _justifying_ the Pursuit of
publick Good, _viz._ "_It is best that all should be happy._" _Best_ is most
good: Good to whom? To the _Whole_, or to each _Individual_? If to the _former_,
when this Truth excites to Action, it must presuppose _kind Affections_; if it
is good to each _Individual_, it must suppose _Self‐Love_.

{#19} #The true Meaning of Reasons exciting to Actions, and reasonable Actions.#
^Let^ us once suppose _Affections_, _Instincts_ or _Desires_ previously
implanted in our Nature: and we shall easily understand the _exciting Reasons_
for Actions, _viz._ "These Truths which shew them to be conducive toward some
_ultimate End_, or toward the _greatest End_ of that kind in our Power." He acts
_reasonably_, who considers the various Actions in his Power, and forms _true
Opinions_ of their _Tendencies_; and then chuses to do that which will obtain
the highest Degree of _that_, to which the _Instincts_ of his Nature incline
him, with the smallest Degree of those things to which the _Affections_ in his
Nature make him averse.

{#20} ^More^ particularly, the _exciting Reasons_ to a Nature which had only
_selfish Affections_, are those Truths which shewed "what Object or Event would
occasion to it the greatest Quantity of _Pleasure_:" these would excite to the
Prosecution of it. The _exciting Truths_ about _Means_, would be only those
which pointed out some Means as more certainly effectual than any other, or with
less _Pain_ or _Trouble_ to the _Agent_. _Publick Usefulness_ of _Ends_ or
_Means_, or _publick Hurtfulness_ would neither excite nor dissuade, farther
than the _publick State_ might affect _that_ of the Agent.

{#21} ^If^ there is any Nature with _publick Affections_: The Truths exciting to
any _End_ in this Order, are such as shew, "that any Event would promote the
Happiness of others." That _End_ is called most _reasonable_, which our Reason
discovers to contain a greater Quantity of _publick Good_, than any other in our
power.

{#22} ^When^ any Event may affect both the _Agent_ and _others_, if the Agent
have both _Self‐Love_ and _publick Affections_, he acts according to that
Affection which is _strongest_, when there is any _Opposition_ of Interests; if
there be no Opposition, he follows both. If he discovers this Truth, that "his
constant pursuit of _publick Good_ is the most probable way of promoting his
_own Happiness_," then his Pursuit is truly reasonable and constant; thus both
Affections are at once gratifyed, and he is consistent with himself. Without
knowledge of that Truth he does not act _reasonably_ for his own Happiness, but
follows it by _Means_ not tending effectually to this _End_: and must
frequently, from the Power of _Self‐Love_, neglect or counteract his other
_End_, the _publick Good_. If there be also a _moral Sense_ in such an Agent,
while yet he is inadvertent to the _Connexion_ of _private Happiness_ with the
_Study of the publick_; he must be perpetually yet more uneasy, either through
the apprehended _Neglect of private Interest_  when he serves the Publick; or
when he pursues only _private Interest_, he will have perpetual _Remorse_ and
_Dissatisfaction_ with his own Temper, through his _moral Sense_. So that the
Knowledge of this _Connexion_ of private Interest, with the Study of publick
Good, seems absolutely necessary to preserve a constant _Satisfaction_ of Mind,
and to prevent an _alternate Prevalence_ of seemingly contrary Desires.

{#23} ^Should^ any one ask even concerning these two _ultimate Ends_, _private
Good_ and _publick_, is not the latter more _reasonable_ than the former?—What
means the Word _reasonable_ in this Question? If we are allowed to presuppose
_Instincts_ and _Affections_, then the Truth just now supposed to be
discoverable concerning our State, is an _exciting Reason_ to _serve the publick
Interest_, since this Conduct is the most _effectual Means_ to obtain both ends.
But I doubt if any Truth can be assigned which _excites_ in us either the Desire
of _private Happiness_ or _publick_. For the _former_ none ever alledged any
_exciting Reason_: and a _benevolent Temper_ finds as little _Reason exciting_
him to the latter; which he desires without any view to _private Good_. If the
meaning of the Question be this, "does not every _Spectator approve_ the Pursuit
of publick Good more than private?" The Answer is obvious that he does: but not
for any _Reason_ or _Truth_, but from a _moral Sense_.

{#24} ^This^ leads to consider _Approbation_ of Actions, whether it be for
_Conformity to any Truth_, or _Reasonableness_, that Actions are ultimately
approved, independently of any _moral Sense_? Or if all _justifying Reasons_ do
not presuppose it?

{#25} #Justifying Reasons suppose a moral Sense.# ^If^ _Conformity to Truth_, or
_Reasonable_, denote nothing else but that "an Action is the _Object of a true
Proposition_," it is plain, that all Actions should be approved equally, since
as many Truths may be made about the worst, as can be made about the best. See
what was said above about exciting Reasons.

{#26} ^But^ let the _Truths_ commonly assigned as _justifying_ be examined. Here
it is plain, "_A Truth shewing an Action to be fit to attain an End,_" does not
justify it; nor do we approve a _subordinate End_ for any Truth, which only
shews it to be fit to promote the _ultimate End_; for the worst Actions may be
conducive to their _Ends_, and _reasonable_ in that Sense. The _justifying
Reasons_ then must be about the _Ends_ themselves, especially the _ultimate
Ends_. The Question then is, "Does a _Conformity to any Truth_ make us _approve_
an _ultimate End_, previously to any _moral Sense_?" For example, we approve
_pursuing the publick Good_. For what _Reason_? or what is the _Truth_ for
Conformity to which we call it a _reasonable End_? I fancy we can find none in
these Cases, more than we could give for our liking any _pleasant Fruit_.[n2]

{#27} ^The^ Reasons assigned are such as these; "_It is the End proposed by the
^Deity^._" But why do we _approve_ concurring with the divine Ends? This Reason
is given, "_He is our Benefactor_:" But then, for what _Reason_ do we approve
_Concurrence with a Benefactor_? Here we must recur to a _Sense_. Is this the
Reason moving to _Approbation_, "_Study of publick Good tends to the Advantage
of the Approver_?" Then the Quality moving us to _approve_ an Action, is its
being _advantageous to us_, and not _Conformity to a Truth_. This Scheme is
intelligible, but not true in fact. Men _approve_ without Perception of _private
Advantage_; and often do not _condemn or disapprove_ what is plainly pernicious;
as in the Execution of a _just Sentence_, which even the Criminal may _approve_.

{#28} ^If^ any allege, that this is the _justifying Reason_ of the _Pursuit of
publick Good_, "_that it is best all be happy_," then we approve Actions for
their _Tendency to that State which is best_, and not for _Conformity to
Reason_. But here again, what means _best_? _morally best_, or _naturally best_?
If the _former_, they explain the same Word by itself in a Circle: If they mean
the _latter_, that "it is the most happy State where all are happy;" then, _most
happy_, for whom? the _System_, or the _Individual_? If for the _former_, what
Reason makes us _approve the Happiness of a System_? Here we must recur to a
_Sense_ or _kind Affections_. Is it most happy for the _Individual_? Then the
Quality moving _Approbation_ is again _Tendency to private Happiness_, not
_Reasonableness_.

{#29} #Obligation supposes either Affections or a moral Sense.# ^There^ are some
other _Reasons_ assigned in Words differing from the former, but more confused,
such as these: "_It is our Duty to study publick Good. We are obliged to do it.
We owe Obedience to the Deity. The whole is to be preferred to a Part._" But let
these Words _Duty_, _Obligation_, _Owing_, and the meaning of that Gerund or
Participle, _is to be preferred_, be explained; and we shall find ourselves
still at a Loss for _exciting Reasons_ previously to _Affections_, or
_justifying Reasons_ without recourse to a _moral Sense_.

{#30} #The meaning of Obligation.# ^When^ we say one is obliged to an Action, we
either mean, 1. _That the Action is necessary to obtain Happiness to the Agent,
or to avoid Misery_: Or, 2. _That every Spectator, or he himself upon
Reflection, must approve his Action, and disapprove his omitting it, if he
considers fully all its Circumstances_. The former Meaning of the Word
_Obligation_ presupposes _selfish Affections_, and the _Senses of private
Happiness_: The latter Meaning includes the _moral Sense_. =Mr. _Barbeyrac_=, in
his Annotations upon =_Grotius_=,[n3] makes _Obligation_ denote an
_indispensable Necessity to act in a certain manner_. Whoever observes his
Explication of this _Necessity_, (which is not _natural_, otherwise no Man could
act against his Obligation) will find that it denotes only "such a Constitution
of a powerful Superior, as will make it impossible for any Being to obtain
_Happiness_, or avoid _Misery_, but by such a Course of Action." This agrees
with the former Meaning, though sometimes he also includes the latter.

{#31} ^Many^ other confused Definitions have been given of Obligation, by no
obscure Names in the learned World. But let any one give a distinct Meaning,
different from the two above‐mentioned. To pursue them all would be endless;
only let the _Definitions_ be substituted in place of the Word ^Obligation^, in
other parts of each Writer, and let it be observed whether it makes good Sense
or not.[n4]

{#32} #Arguments for some Standard of Morals prior to a Sense considered.#
^Before^ we quit this Character _Reasonableness_, let us consider the Arguments
brought to prove that there must be some Standard of moral Good antecedent to
any Sense. Say they, "_Perceptions of Sense_ are deceitful, we must have some
Perception or Idea of _Virtue_ more stable and certain; this must be _Conformity
to Reason_: _Truth_ discovered by our _Reason_ is certain and invariable: _That_
then alone is the Original Idea of Virtue, _Agreement with Reason_." But in like
manner our _Sight_ and _Sense of Beauty_ is deceitful, and does not always
represent the true _Forms_ of Objects. We must not call that _beautiful_ or
_regular_, which pleases the _Sight_, or an _internal Sense_; but Beauty in
external Forms too, consists in _Conformity_ to _Reason_. So our _Taste_ may be
vitiated: we must not say that _Savour_ is perceived by _Taste_, but must place
the original Idea of _grateful Savours_ in _Conformity to Reason_, and of
_ungrateful_ in _Contrariety to Reason_. We may mistake the real _Extent_ of
Bodies, or their _Proportions_, by making a Conclusion upon the first sensible
Appearance: Therefore _Ideas of Extension_ are not originally acquired by a
_Sense_, but consist in _Conformity to Reason_.

{#33} ^If^ what is intended in this Conformity to Reason be this, "That we
should call no Action _virtuous_, unless we have some _Reason_ to conclude it to
be virtuous, or some _Truth_ shewing it to be so." This is very true; but then
in like manner we should count no Action _vicious_, unless we have some _Reason_
for counting it so, or when it is _Truth_ "that it is vicious." If this be
intended by _Conformity to Truth_, then at the same rate we may make _Conformity
to Truth_ the original Idea of _Vice_ as well as _Virtue_; nay, of every
Attribute whatsoever. That _Taste_ alone is _sweet_, which there is _Reason_ to
count _sweet_; that Taste alone is _bitter_, concerning which it is _true_ that
it is _bitter_; that Form alone is _beautiful_, concerning which it is true that
it is _beautiful_; and that alone _deformed_, which is truly _deformed_. Thus
_Virtue_, _Vice_, _Sweet_, _Bitter_, _Beautiful_, _or Deformed_, originally
denote _Conformity to Reason_, antecedently to Perceptions of any _Sense_. The
_Idea of Virtue_ is particularly that concerning which it is _Truth_, that it is
_Virtue_; or _Virtue_ is _Virtue_; a wonderful Discovery!

{#34} ^So^ when some tell us, "that Truth is naturally pleasant, and more so
than any _sensible Perception_; this must therefore engage Men more than any
other Motive, if they attend to it." Let them observe, that as much _Truth_ is
known about _Vice_ as _Virtue_. We may _demonstrate_ the publick _Miseries_
which would ensue upon _Perjury_, _Murder_, and _Robbery_. These Demonstrations
would be attended with that _Pleasure_ which is peculiar to _Truth_; as well as
the Demonstrations of the publick Happiness to ensue from _Faith_, _Humanity and
Justice_. There is equal Truth on both sides.

{#35} #Whence it is that Virtue is called reasonable and not Vice.# ^We^ may
transiently observe what has occasioned the Use of the Word _reasonable_, as an
Epithet of only _virtuous Actions_. Tho' we have _Instincts_ determining us to
desire _Ends_, without supposing any previous _Reasoning_; yet it is by use of
our _Reason_ that we find out the Means of obtaining our _Ends_. When we do not
use our Reason, we often are disappointed of our End. We therefore call those
Actions which are _effectual_ to their Ends, _reasonable_ in one Sense of that
Word.

{#36} ^Again^, in all Men there is probably a _moral Sense_, making publickly
useful Actions and kind Affections _grateful_ to the Agent, and to every
Observer: Most Men who have thought of human Actions, agree, that the _publickly
useful_ are in the whole also _privately useful_ to the Agent, either in this
Life or the next: We conclude, that all Men have the _same Affections and
Senses_: We are convinced by our Reason, that it is by publickly useful Actions
alone that we can promote _all our Ends_. Whoever then acts in a contrary
manner, we presume is _mistaken_, _ignorant of_, or _inadvertent_ to, these
Truths which he might know; and say he acts _unreasonably_. Hence some have been
led to imagine, some _Reasons_ either exciting or justifying previously to all
_Affections_ or a _moral Sense_.

{#37} #Objections from our judging even of our Affections and Senses
themselves.# ^Two^ Arguments are brought in defense of this Epithet, as
antecedent to any Sense, _viz._ "That we judge even of our _Affections_ and
_Senses_ themselves, whether they are _morally Good_or _Evil_."

{#38} ^The^ second Argument is, that "if all _moral Ideas_ depend upon the
_Constitution_ of our _Sense_, then all _Constitutions_ would have been alike
reasonable and good to the ^Deity^, which is absurd."

{#39} #1. That we judge our Senses themselves.# ^As^ to the first Argument, it
is plain we judge of our own _Affections_, or those of others by our _moral
Sense_, by which we approve kind Affections, and disapprove the contrary. But
none can apply _moral Attributes_ to the very _Faculty_ of perceiving _moral
Qualities_; or call his _moral Sense_ _morally Good_ or _Evil_, any more than he
calls the _Power of Tasting_, _sweet_, or _bitter_; or of _Seeing_, _strait_ or
_crooked_, _white_ or _black_.

{#40} #Answered.# ^Every^ one judges the _Affections_ of others by his own
_Sense_; so that it seems not impossible that in these _Senses_ Men might differ
as they do in _Taste_. A _Sense approving Benevolence_ would disapprove _that
Temper_, which a _Sense approving Malice_ would delight in. The _former_ would
judge of the _latter_ by his _own Sense_, so would the _latter_ of the _former_.
Each one would at first view think the _Sense_ of the other perverted. But then,
is there no difference? Are both Senses equally _good_? No certainly, any _Man_
who observed them would think the _Sense_ of the _former_ more desirable than of
the _latter_; but this is, because the _moral Sense_ of every _Man_ is
constituted in the former manner. But were there any Nature with no _moral
Sense_ at all observing these two Persons, would he not think the State of the
_former_ preferable to that of the _latter_? Yes, he might: but not from any
Perception of _moral Goodness_ in the one _Sense_ more than in the other. Any
rational Nature observing two Men thus constituted, with _opposite Senses_,
might by reasoning see, not _moral Goodness_ in one _Sense_ more than in the
contrary, but a _Tendency to the Happiness of the Person himself_, who had the
former _Sense_ in the one Constitution, and a _contrary Tendency_ in the
opposite _Constitution_: nay, the Persons themselves might observe this; since
the _former Sense_ would make these Actions grateful to the Agent which were
useful to others; who, if they had a like Sense, would _love_ him, and return
_good Offices_; whereas the _latter Sense_ would make all such Actions as are
_useful to others_, and apt to engage their _good Offices_, ungrateful to the
Agent; and would lead him into _publickly hurtful Actions_, which would not only
procure the Hatred of others, if they had a _contrary Sense_, but engage them
out of their _Self‐Love_ to study his _Destruction_, tho' their _Senses_ agreed.
Thus any _Observer_, or the _Agent_ himself with this _latter Sense_, might
perceive that the _Pains_ to be feared, as the Consequence of _malicious
Actions_, did over‐ballance the _Pleasures_ of this _Sense_; so that it would be
to the Agent's _Interest_ to counteract it. Thus one Constitution of the _moral
Sense_ might appear to be more _advantageous_ to those who had it, than the
contrary; as we may call that Sense of Tasting _healthful_, which made wholesome
Meat pleasant; and we would call a contrary _Taste_ _pernicious_. And yet we
should no more call the moral Sense _morally good_ or _evil_, than we call the
_Sense of Tasting_ _savoury_ or _unsavoury_, _sweet_ or _bitter_.

{#41} ^But^ must we not own, that we judge of all our _Senses_ by our _Reason_,
and often correct their _Reports_ of the _Magnitude_, _Figure_, _Colour_,
_Taste_ of Objects, and pronounce them _right_ or _wrong_, as they agree or
disagree with _Reason_? This is true. But does it then follow, that _Extension_,
_Figure_, _Colour_, _Taste_, are not _sensible Ideas_, but only denote
_Reasonableness_, or _Agreement with Reason_? Or that these Qualities are
perceivable antecedently to any _Sense_, by our _Power of finding out Truth_?
Just so a _compassionate Temper_ may rashly imagine the _Correction of a Child_,
or the _Execution of a Criminal_, to be cruel and inhuman: but by _reasoning_
may discover the _superior Good_ arising from them in the whole; and then the
same _moral Sense_ may determine the Observer to approve them. But we must not
hence conclude, that it is any _reasoning_ antecedent to a _moral Sense_, which
determines us to _approve_ the Study of publick Good, any more than we can in
the former Case conclude, that we perceive _Extension_, _Figure_, _Colour_,
_Taste_, antecedently to a Sense. All these Sensations are often corrected by
_Reasoning_, as well as our _Approbations_ of Actions as _Good_ or _Evil_:[n5]
and yet no body ever placed the _Original Idea_ of _Extension_, _Figure_,
_Colour_, _or Taste_, in _Conformity to Reason_.

{#42} ^'Tis^ manifest we have in our _Understanding_ _moral Ideas_, or they are
Perceptions of the Soul: we reason about them, we compare, we judge; butwhen we
do all the same Acts about _Extension_, _Figure_, _Colour_, _Taste_, _Sound_,
which Perceptions all Men call _Sensations_. All our Ideas, or the materials of
our reasoning or judging, are received by some immediate Powers of Perception
internal or external, which we may call _Senses_; by these too we have Pleasure
and Pain. All Perception is by the Soul, not by the Body, tho' some Impressions
on the bodily Organs are the Occasions of some of them; and in others the Soul
is determined to other sorts of _Feelings_ or _Sensations_, where no bodily
Impression is the immediate Occasion. A certain _incorporeal Form_, if one may
use that Name, a _Temper_ observed, _a Character_, _an Affection_, _a State_ of
a sensitive Being, known or understood, may raise _Liking_, _Approbation_,
_Sympathy_, as naturally from the very Constitution of the Soul, as any bodily
Impression raises external Sensations. Reasoning or _Intellect_ seems to raise
no new Species of Ideas, but to discover or discern the _Relations_ of those
received. Reason shews what Acts are conformable to a _Law_, a _Will_ of a
Superior; or what Acts tend to Private Good, or to Publick Good: In like manner,
Reason discovers contrary Tendencies of contrary Actions. Both Contraries are
alike the Object of the Understanding, and may give that sort of Pleasure which
arises upon Discovery of Truth. A Demonstration that certain Actions are
detrimental to Society is attended with the peculiar _Pleasure of new
Knowledge_, as much as a like Demonstration of the Benefit of Virtue. But when
we _approve_ a kind beneficent Action, let us consider whether this _Feeling_,
or _Action_, or _Modification_ of the Soul more resembles an Act of
_Contemplation_, such as this _when strait Lines intersect each other, the
vertical Angles are equal_; or that _Liking_ we have to a beautiful Form, an
harmonious Composition, a grateful Sound.

{#43} ^Thus^ tho' no Man can immediately either _approve_ or _disapprove_ as
_morally good or evil_ his own _moral Sense_, by which he approves only
_Affections_ and _Actions_ consequent upon them; yet he may see whether it be
_advantageous_ to him in other respects, to have it constituted _one way_ rather
than another. _One Constitution_ may make these Actions grateful to this Sense
which tend to procure _other Pleasures_ also. A _contrary Constitution_ may be
known to the very Person himself to be _disadvantageous_, as making these
Actions _immediately grateful_, which shall occasion all _other sorts_ of
Misery. His _Self‐Love_ may excite him, tho' with _Dissatisfaction_, to
counteract this Sense, in order to avoid a greater _Evil_. =Mr. _Hobbes_= seems
to have had no better Notions of the _natural State_ of Mankind. An Observer,
who was _benevolent_, would desire that all had the former sort of _Sense_; a
_malicious Observer_, if he feared no _Evil to himself_, from the Actions of the
Persons observed, would desire the _latter Constitution_. If this Observer had a
_moral Sense_, he would think that _Constitution_ which was contrary to _his
own_, _strange_ and _surprizing_, or _unnatural_. If the Observer had no
_Affections_ toward others, and were disjoined from Mankind, so as to have
neither _Hopes_ nor _Fears_ from their Actions, he would be indifferent about
their _Constitutions_, and have no _Desire_ or _Preference_ of one above
another; tho' he might see which were _advantageous_ to them, and which
pernicious.

{#44} #The 2d Objection, that all Constitutions would have been alikereasonable,
answered.# ^As^ to the second Argument, What means _alike reasonable or good to
the ^Deity^_? Does it mean, "that the ^Deity^ could have had no _Reasons
exciting_ him to make one Constitution rather than another?" 'Tis plain, if the
^Deity^ had nothing _essential to his Nature_, corresponding to our _sweetest_
and _most kind Affections_, we can scarce suppose he could have any _Reason
exciting_ him to any thing he has done: but grant such a _Disposition_ in the
^Deity^, and then the manifest _Tendency of the present Constitution to the
Happiness of his Creatures_ was an exciting Reason for chusing it before the
contrary.[n6] Each sort of Constitution might have given Men an equal _immediate
Pleasure_ in present _Self-Approbation_ for any sort of Action; but the Actions
approved by the _present Sense_, procure all _Pleasures_ of the _other Senses_;
and the Actions which would have been approved by a _contrary moral Sense_,
would have been productive of all _Torments of the other Senses_.

{#45} ^If^ it be meant, that "_upon this Supposition, that all our Approbation
presupposes in us a moral Sense, the ^DDeity^ could not have approved one
Constitution more than another_:" where is the Consequence? Why may not the
Deity have something of a superior Kind, analogous to our _moral Sense_,
essential to him? How does any Constitution of the _Senses of Men_ hinder the
^Deity^ to reflect and judge of his own Actions? How does it affect the divine
Apprehension, which way soever _moral Ideas_ arise with Men?

{#46} ^If^ it means "_that we cannot approve one Constitution more than another,
or approve the ^Deity^ for making the _present Constitution__:" This Consequence
is also false. The _present Constitution_ of our _moral Sense_ determines us to
approve all _kind Affections_: This Constitution the ^Deity^ must have foreseen
as _tending_ to the _Happiness_ of his Creatures; it does therefore evidence
_kind Affection_ or _Benevolence_ in the ^Deity^, this therefore we must
_approve_.

{#47} #The meaning of _antecedent Reasonableness_.# ^We^ have got some strange
Phrases, "_that some things are antecedently reasonable in the Nature of the
thing_," which some insist upon: "That otherwise, say they, if before Man was
created, any Nature _without a moral Sense_ had existed, this Nature would not
have approved as morally good in the Deity, his constituting our Sense as it is
at present." Very true; and what next? If there had been no _moral Sense_ in
that Nature, there would have been no _Perception of Morality_. But "could not
such Natures have seen something _reasonable_ in one Constitution more than in
another?" They might no doubt have _reasoned_ about the various _Constitutions_,
and foreseen that the _present one_ would tend to the _Happiness_ of Mankind,
and would evidence _Benevolence_ in the ^Deity^; So also they might have
_reasoned_ about the _contrary Constitution_, that it would make Men miserable,
and evidence _Malice_ in the Deity. They would have _reasoned_ about _both_, and
found out _Truths_: are both Constitutions alike _reasonable_ to these
Observers? No, say they, "the _benevolent_ one is _reasonable_, and the
_malicious_ _unreasonable_:" And yet these Observers _reasoned_ and _discovered
Truths_ about both: An Action then is called by us _reasonable_ when it is
_benevolent_, and _unreasonable_ when _malicious_. This is plainly making the
Word _reasonable_ denote whatever is _approved_ by our moral Sense, without
Relation to _true Propositions_. We often use that Word in such a confused
Manner: But these _antecedent Natures_, supposed without a _moral Sense_, would
not have _approved_ one Constitution of the ^Deity^ as _morally_ better than
another.

{#48} ^Had^ it been left to the Choice of these _antecedent Minds_, what _manner
of Sense_ they would have desired for Mankind; would they have seen no
_difference_? Yes they would, according to their _Affections_ which are
presupposed in all _Election_. If they were _benevolent_, as we suppose the
^Deity^, the _Tendency of the present Sense to the Happiness of Men_ would have
excited their Choice. Had they been _malicious_, as we suppose the Devil, the
_contrary Tendency_ of the _contrary Sense_ would have excited their _Election_
of it. But is there nothing _preferable_, or _eligible_ antecedently to all
_Affections_ too? No certainly, unless there can be _Desire_ without
_Affections_, or _superior Desire_, _i.e._ Election antecedently to all
_Desire_.

{#49} #Reasons for Election different from those for Approbation.# ^Some^ do
farther perplex this Subject, by asserting, that "the same _Reasons_ determining
_Approbation_, ought also to excite to _Election_." Here, 1. We often see
_justifying Reasons_ where we can have no _Election_; _viz._ when we observe the
_Actions of others_, which were even prior to our _Existence_. 2. The Quality
moving us to _Election_ very often cannot excite _Approbation_; viz. _private
usefulness_, not publickly pernicious. This both does and _ought_ to move
_Election_, and yet I believe few will say, "they _approve_ as virtuous the
_eating a Bunch of Grapes_, taking a _Glass of Wine_, or _sitting down_ when one
is tired." _Approbation_ is not what we can _voluntarily_ bring upon ourselves.
When we are contemplating Actions, we do not _chuse_ to approve, because
_Approbation_ is pleasant; otherwise we would always approve, and never condemn
any Action; because this is some way uneasy. _Approbation_ is plainly a
_Perception_ arising without previous _Volition_, or Choice of it, because of
any _concomitant Pleasure_. The Occasion of it is the _Perception of benevolent
Affections_ in ourselves, or the discovering the like in others, even when we
are incapable of any _Action_ or _Election_. The _Reasons_ determining
_Approbation_ are such as shew that an Action evidenced _kind Affections_, and
that in _others_, as often as in _ourselves_. Whereas, the _Reasons_ moving to
Election are such as shew the _Tendency of an Action to gratify some Affection_
in the Agent.

{#50} ^The^ _Prospect_ of the Pleasure of _Self‐Approbation_, is indeed often a
Motive to _chuse_ one Action rather than another; but this supposes the _moral
Sense_, or Determination to _approve_, prior to the _Election_. Were Approbation
_voluntarily_ chosen, from the Prospect of its concomitant Pleasure, then there
could be no _Condemnation_ of our own Actions, for that is unpleasant.

{#51} As to that confused Word _ought_ it is needless to apply to it again all
that was said about _Obligation_.

{#n1} Thus =_Grotius_= distinguishes the Reasons of War, into the
$Justific{ae}$, and $Suasori{ae}$, or these, $sub ratione utilis$.

{#n2} This is what =_Aristotle_= so often asserts that the $προαιρετὸν or
βουλεντὸν$ is not the End, but the Means.

{#n3} [_Lib J. Chap. 1. Sect. 10._]

{#n4} The common Definition, $Vinculum Juris que necessitate aastringimur
alicujus rei praestandae$, is wholly metaphorical, and can settle no Debate
precisely.

{#n6} A late Author on [_the Foundation of Moral Goodness,_ _&c._ p. 9._]
thus argues: "If such a Disposition is in the Deity, is it a Perfection, or is
it not? is it better than the contrary, more worthy of his Nature, more
agreeable to his other Perfections? If not, let us not ascribe it to him: If it
be, then for what Reason, Account, or Ground is it better? That Reason, Account,
or Ground, must be the Foundation of moral Goodness. If there be no Reason why
it is better, then God is acted by a blind unaccountable Impulse." In Answer,
one may first ask the precise Meaning of these vague Words, _Perfection_,
_Betterness_, _Worthiness_, _Agreement_. If these Terms denote "whatever makes
the Being possessed of them happier, than he would be without them;" then, 1. It
is plain, kind Dispositions are Perfections to Men in our present Frame; are
better for us than the contrary, and agree better with our other Powers; _i.e._
they tend to preserve them, and procure us many Enjoyments. 2. Our apprehending
such Dispositions in God, according to our Frame makes us esteem and love him.
3. Our Knowledge of God is so imperfect, that it is not easy to prove that such
Dispositions tend to make or preserve him happy, or to procure him other
Enjoyments. And yet, 4. We may have good Reason, Ground, or Evidence, from his
Works and Administration to believe him Benevolent. 5. If he has real Good‐will
to his Creatures, their Perfection or Happiness is to him an ultimate End,
intended without farther View or Reason: And yet, 6. He is not _acted by a blind
Impulse_: the ultimate End is known to him, and the best Means chosen; which
never happen in what we call blind Impulses; unless one calls _willing any
ultimate End_ a blind Impulse. For thus each Man should desire his own Happiness
by a blind Impulse: And God's willing to regard the _Fitness of Things_, must be
a blind Impulse, unless he have a _prior Reason_ why he wills what his
Understanding represents as _fit_, rather than what is _unfit_; for his
Understanding represents both. And there must be a prior _Fitness_ or
_Reasonableness_ that he should will what is _fit_, and a yet prior _Fitness_
that he should regard the _Fitness_ of willing what is fit, and so on. If in
these Questions is meant, not by what Argument do we prove that the Deity is
benevolent? but, "what is the efficient Cause of that Disposition in God?" Those
Gentlemen must answer for us, who tell us also of the _Reason or Ground of the
Divine Existence_; and that not as a Proof that he does exist, or the $Causa
Cognoscendi$, as the Schoolmen speak; but the $Causa Essendi$ of that Being
which they acknowledge uncaused and independent. See [Dr. _Sam. Clarke's Boyle's
Lectures_].
