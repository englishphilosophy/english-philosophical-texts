£3 _Concerning some _Powers_ of _Perception_, distinct from what is generally
understood by _Sensation_._ £3

{#1} TO make the following Observations understood, it may be necessary to
premise some _Definitions_, and _Observations_, either universally acknowledg'd,
or sufficiently prov'd by many Writers both antient and modern, concerning our
Perceptions called _Sensations_, and the Actions of the Mind consequent upon
them.

{#2} #Sensation.# ^Those^ _Ideas_ which are rais'd in the Mind upon the presence
of external Objects, and their acting upon our Bodys, are call'd _Sensations_.
We find that the Mind in such Cases is passive, and has not Power directly to
prevent the Perception or Idea, or to vary it at its Reception, as long as we
continue our Bodys in a state fit to be acted upon by the external Object.

{#3} #Different Senses.# ^When^ two Perceptions are intirely different from each
other, or agree in nothing but the general Idea of _Sensation_, we call the
Powers of receiving those different Perceptions, _different Senses_. Thus
_Seeing_ and _Hearing_ denote the different Powers of receiving the Ideas of
Colours and Sounds. And altho' Colours have great Differences among themselves,
as also have Sounds; yet there is a greater Agreement among the most opposite
Colours, than between any Colour and a Sound: Hence we call all Colours
Perceptions of the same Sense. All the several Senses seem to have their
distinct Organs, except _Feeling_, which is in some degree diffus'd over the
whole Body.

{#4} #The Mind how active.# ^The^ Mind has a Power of _compounding_ Ideas, which
were receiv'd separately; of _comparing_ their Objects by means of the Ideas,
and of observing their _Relations_ and _Proportions_; of _enlarging_ and
_diminishing_ its Ideas at pleasure, or in any certain _Ratio_, or Degree; and
of considering _separately_ each of the simple Ideas, which might perhaps have
been impress'd jointly in the Sensation. This last Operation we commonly call
_Abstraction_.

{#5} #Substances.# ^The^ Ideas of _Corporeal Substances_ are compounded of the
various simple Ideas jointly impress'd, when they presented themselves to our
Senses. We define Substances only by enumerating these sensible Ideas: And such
Definitions may raise a clear enough Idea of the Substance in the Mind of one
who never immediately perceiv'd the Substance; provided he has separately
receiv'd by his Senses all the simple Ideas which are in the Composition of the
complex one of the Substance defin'd: But if there be any simple Ideas which he
has not receiv'd, or if he wants any of the Senses necessary for the Perception
of them, no Definition can raise any simple Idea which has not been before
perceived by the _Senses_.

{#6} #Education. Instruction.# ^Hence^ it follows, "That when _Instruction_,
_Education_, or _Prejudice_ of any kind, raise any Desire or Aversion toward an
Object, this Desire or Aversion must be founded upon an Opinion of some
Perfection, or of some Deficiency in those _Qualitys_, for Perception of which
we have the proper Senses." Thus, if _Beauty_ be desir'd by one who has not the
Sense of _Sight_, the Desire must be rais'd by some apprehended Regularity of
_Figure_, _Sweetness_ of _Voice_, _Smoothness_, or _Softness_, or some other
Quality perceivable by the other Senses, without relation to the Ideas of
_Colour_.

{#7} #Pleasure. Pain.# ^Many^ of our sensitive Perceptions are pleasant and many
painful, immediately, and that without any Knowledge of the Cause of this
Pleasure or Pain, or how the Objects excite it, or are the Occasions of it; or
without seeing to what further Advantage or Detriment the Use of such Objects
might tend: Nor would the most accurate Knowledge of these things vary either
the Pleasure or Pain of the Perception, however it might give a rational
Pleasure distinct from the sensible; or might raise a distinct Joy, from a
prospect of further Advantage in the Object, or Aversion, from an apprehension
of Evil.

{#8} #Different Ideas.# ^The^ _simple Ideas_ rais'd in different Persons by the
same Object, are probably some way different, when they disagree in their
Approbation or Dislike; and in the same Person, when his _Fancy_ at one time
differs from what it was at another. This will appear from reflecting on those
Objects, to which we have now an Aversion, tho' they were formerly agreeable:
And we shall generally find that there is some accidental _Conjunction_ of a
disagreeable Idea, which always recurs with the Object; as in those Wines to
which Men acquire an Aversion, after they have taken them in an Emetick
Preparation: In this case we are conscious that the _Idea_ is alter'd from what
it was when that Wine was agreeable, by the Conjunction of the Ideas of Loathing
and Sickness of Stomach. The like Change of _Idea_ may be insensibly made by the
Change of our Bodys as we advance in Years, or when we are accustomed to any
Object, which may occasion an Indifference toward Meats we were fond of in our
Childhood; and may make some Objects cease to raise the disagreeable Ideas,
which they excited upon our first use of them. Many of our simple Perceptions
are disagreeable only thro' the too great _Intenseness_ of the Quality: thus
moderate Light is agreeable, very strong Light may be painful; moderate Bitter
may be pleasant, a higher Degree may be offensive. A Change in our Organs will
necessarily occasion a Change in the Intenseness of the Perception at least; nay
sometimes will occasion a quite contrary Perception: Thus a warm Hand shall feel
that Water cold, which a cold hand shall feel warm.

{#9} ^We^ shall not find it perhaps so easy to account for the Diversity of
Fancy about more _complex Ideas_ of Objects, including many Ideas of different
Senses at once; as in some Perceptions of those call'd _primary Qualitys_, and
some _secondary_, as explain'd by =Mr. ^Locke^=: for instance, in the different
Fancys about _Architecture_, _Gardening_, _Dress_. Of the two former we shall
offer something in [Sect. VI.] As to _Dress_, we may generally account for the
Diversity of Fancys from a like Conjunction of Ideas: Thus, if either from any
thing in Nature, or from the Opinion of our Country or Acquaintance, the
fancying of _glaring Colours_ be look'd upon as an evidence of Levity, or of any
other evil Quality of Mind; or if any _Colour or Fashion_ be commonly us'd by
Rusticks, or by Men of any disagreeable Profession, Employment, or Temper; these
additional Ideas may recur constantly with that of the _Colour_ or _Fashion_,
and cause a constant Dislike to them in those who join the additional Ideas,
altho' the Colour or Form be no way disagreeable of themselves, and actually do
please others who join no such Ideas to them. But there appears no Ground to
believe such a Diversity in human Minds, as that the same simple Idea or
Perception should give pleasure to one and pain to another, or to the same
Person at different times; not to say that it seems a Contradiction, that the
same simple Idea should do so.

{#10} #Complex Ideas.# ^The^ only Pleasure of Sense, which many Philosophers
seem to consider, is that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation: But
there are far greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of Objects, which obtain
the Names of _Beautiful_, _Regular_, _Harmonious_. Thus every one acknowledges
he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture, than with the View of any
one Colour, were it as strong and lively as possible; and more pleas'd with a
Prospect of the Sun arising among settled Clouds, and colouring their Edges,
with a starry Hemisphere, a fine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear
blue Sky, a smooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify'd by Woods, Hills,
Waters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are not quite _simple_.
So in Musick, the Pleasure of _fine Composition_ is incomparably greater than
that of any one Note, how sweet, full, or swelling soever.

{#11} #Beauty.# ^Let^ it be observ'd, that in the following Papers, the Word
_Beauty_ is taken for _the Idea rais'd in us_, and a _Sense_ of Beauty for _our
Power of receiving this Idea_. #Harmony.# _Harmony_ also denotes _our pleasant
Ideas arising from Composition of Sounds_, and a _good Ear_ (as it is generally
taken) a _Power of perceiving this Pleasure_. In the following Sections, an
Attempt is made to discover "what is the immediate Occasion of these pleasant
Ideas, or what real Quality in the Objects ordinarily excites them."

{#12} #Internal Sense.# ^It^ is of no consequence whether we call these Ideas of
_Beauty_ and _Harmony_, Perceptions of the _External Senses_ of Seeing and
Hearing, or not. I should rather chuse to call our Power of perceiving these
Ideas, an ^Internal Sense^, were it only for the Convenience of distinguishing
them from other Sensations of Seeing and Hearing, which men may have without
Perception of _Beauty_ and _Harmony_. It is plain from Experience, that many Men
have, in the common meaning, the Senses of Seeing and Hearing perfect enough;
they perceive all the _simple Ideas_ separately, and have their Pleasures; they
distinguish them from each other, such as one Colour from another, either quite
different, or the stronger or fainter of the same Colour, when they are plac'd
beside each other, altho' they may often confound their _Names_, when they occur
apart from each other; as some do the Names of _Green_ and _Blue_: they can tell
in separate Notes the _higher_, _lower_, _sharper or flatter_, when separately
sounded; in Figures they discern the _Length_, _Breadth_, _Wideness_ of each
Line, Surface, Angle; and may be as capable of hearing and seeing at great
Distances as any Men whatsoever: And yet perhaps they shall find no Pleasure in
Musical Compositions, in Painting, Architecture, natural Landskip; or but a very
weak one in comparison of what others enjoy from the same Objects. This greater
Capacity of receiving such pleasant Ideas we commonly call a _fine Genius_ or
_Taste_: In Musick we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct
Sense from the External one of Hearing, and call it a _good Ear_; and the like
Distinction we should probably acknowledge in other Objects, had we also got
distinct Names to denote these _Powers_ of Perception by.

{#13} #Different from External.# ^We^ generally imagine the brute Animals
endowed with the same sort of Powers of Perception as our _External Senses_, and
having sometimes greater Acuteness in them: but we conceive few or none of them
with any of these sublimer Powers of Perception here call'd _Internal Senses_;
or at least if some of them have them, it is in a Degree much inferior to ours.

{#14} ^There^ will appear another Reason perhaps afterwards, for calling this
Power of perceiving the Ideas of _Beauty_, an _Internal Sense_, from this, that
in some other Affairs, where our _External Senses_ are not much concern'd, we
discern a sort of Beauty, very like, in many respects, to that observ'd in
sensible Objects, and accompany'd with like Pleasure: Such is that _Beauty_
perceiv'd in _Theorems_, or universal Truths, in _general Causes_, and in some
_extensive Principles_ of Action.

{#15} ^Let^ one consider, first, That 'tis probably a Being may have the full
Power of External Sensation, which we enjoy, so as to perceive each Colour,
Line, Surface, as we do; yet, without the Power of _comparing_, or of discerning
the _Similitudes_ or Proportions: Again, It might discern these also, and yet
have no _Pleasure_ or Delight accompanying these Perceptions. The bare Idea of
the Form is something separable from Pleasure, as may appear from the different
_Tastes_ of Men about the Beauty of Forms, where we don't imagine that they
differ in any Ideas, either of the Primary or Secondary Qualities. _Similitude_,
_Proportion_, _Analogy_, or _Equality_ of Proportion, are Objects of the
Understanding, and must be actually known before we know the natural Causes of
our Pleasure. But _Pleasure_ perhaps is not necessarily connected with the
Perception of them: and may be felt where the Proportion is not known or
attended to: and may not be felt where the Proportion is observed. Since then
there are such different Powers of Perception, where what are commonly called
the _External Senses_ are the same; since the most accurate Knowledge of what
the External Senses discover, may often not give the Pleasure of Beauty or
Harmony, which yet one of a _good Taste_ will enjoy at once without much
_Knowledge_; we may justly use another Name for these higher and more delightful
Perceptions of Beauty and Harmony, and call the _Power_ of receiving such
Impressions, and _Internal Sense_: The Difference of the Perceptions seems
sufficient to vindicate the Use of a different Name, especially when we are told
in what Meaning the Word is applied.

{#16} #Its Pleasures necessary and immediate.# ^This^ superior Power of
Perception is justly called a _Sense_, because of its Affinity to the other
Senses in this, that the Pleasure does not arise from any _Knowledge_ of
Principles, Proportions, Causes, or of the Usefulness of the Object; we are
struck at the first with the Beauty: nor does the most accurate _Knowledge_
increase this Pleasure of Beauty, however it may superadd a distinct rational
Pleasure from prospects of _Advantage_, or may bring along that peculiar kind of
Pleasure, which attends the Increase of Knowledge[n1].

{#17}  ^And^ further, the Ideas of Beauty and Harmony, like other sensible
Ideas, are _necessarily_ pleasant to us, as well as immediately so; neither can
any Resolution of our own, nor any _Prospect_ of Advantage or Disadvantage, vary
the Beauty or Deformity of an Object: For as in the external Sensations, no View
of _Interest_ will make an Object grateful, nor View of _Detriment_, distinct
from immediate _Pain_ in the Perception, make it disagreeable to the Sense; so
propose the whole World as a _Reward_, or _threaten_ the greatest Evil, to make
us approve a deform'd Object, or disapprove a beautiful one; Dissimulation may
be procur'd by Rewards or Threatnings, or we may in external Conduct abstain
from any _Pursuit_ of the Beautiful, and pursue the Deform'd; but our
_Sentiments_ of the Forms, and our _Perceptions_, would continue invariably the
same.

{#18} #This Sense antecedent to and distinct from prospects of interest.#
^Hence^ it plainly appears, "that some Objects are _immediately_ the Occasions
of this Pleasure of Beauty, and that we have Senses fitted for perceiving it;
and that it is distinct from that _Joy_ which arises upon Prospect of
Advantage." Nay, do not we often see Convenience and Use neglected to obtain
Beauty, without any other prospect of _Advantage_ in the Beautiful Form, than
the suggesting the pleasant Ideas of Beauty? Now this shews us, that however we
may _pursue_ beautiful Objects from Self-love, with a view to obtain the
Pleasures of Beauty, as in Architecture, Gardening, and many other Affairs; yet
there must be a _Sense_ of Beauty, antecedent to Prospects even of this
Advantage, without which Sense these Objects would not be thus _advantageous_,
nor excite in us this Pleasure which constitutes them advantageous. Our _Sense_
of Beauty from Objects, by which they are constituted good to us, is very
distinct from our _Desire_ of them when they are thus constituted: Our _Desire_
of Beauty may be counter-balanc'd by Rewards or Threatnings, but never our
_Sense_ of it; even as Fear of Death may make us desire a bitter Potion, or
neglect those Meats which the Sense of Taste would recommend as pleasant; but
cannot make that Potion agreeable to the _Sense_, or Meat disagreeable to it,
which was not so antecedently to this Prospect. The same holds true of the Sense
of Beauty and Harmony; that the _Pursuit_ of such Objects is frequently
neglected, from Prospects of Advantage, Aversion to Labour, or any other Motive
of Interest, does not prove that we have no _Sense_ of Beauty, but only that our
Desire of it may be counter-balanc'd by a stronger Desire.

{#19} ^Had^ we no such _Sense_ of Beauty and Harmony; Houses, Gardens, Dress,
Equipage, might have been recommended to us as convenient, fruitful, warm, easy;
but never as _beautiful_: And yet nothing is more certain, than that all these
Objects are recommended under quite different _Views_ on many Occasions: 'Tis
true, what chiefly pleases in the Countenance, are the Indications of _Moral
Dispositions_; and yet were we by the longest Acquaintance fully convinc'd of
the best Moral Dispositions in any Person, with that Countenance we now think
deform'd, this would never hinder our immediate Dislike of the Form, or our
liking other Forms more: And Custom, Education, or Example, could never give us
_Perceptions_ distinct from those of the Senses which we had the Use of before,
or recommend Objects under another _Conception_ than grateful to[n2] them. But
of the Influence of Custom, Education, Example, upon the Sense of Beauty, we
shall treat below[n3].

{#20} #Beauty, Original or Comparative.# ^Beauty^ is either _Original_ or
_Comparative_; or, if any like the Terms better, _Absolute_, or _Relative_: Only
let it be observ'd, that by _Absolute_ or _Original_ Beauty, is not understood
any Quality suppos'd to be in the Object, which should of itself be beautiful,
without relation to any Mind which perceives it: For Beauty, like other Names of
sensible Ideas, properly denotes the _Perception_ of some Mind; so _Cold_,
_Hot_, _Sweet_, _Bitter_, denote the Sensations in our Minds, to which perhaps
there is no resemblance in the Objects, which excite these Ideas in us, however
we generally imagine otherwise. The Ideas of Beauty and Harmony being excited
upon our _Perception_ of some _primary Quality_, and having relation to _Figure_
and _Time_, may indeed have a nearer resemblance to Objects, than these
Sensations, which seem not so much any _Pictures_ of Objects, as _Modifications_
of the perceiving Mind; and yet were there no Mind with a _Sense_ of Beauty to
contemplate Objects, I see not how they could be call'd _Beautiful_. We
therefore by[n4] _Absolute_ Beauty understand only that Beauty which we perceive
in Objects without _Comparison_ to any thing external, of which the Object is
suppos'd an Imitation, or Picture; such as that Beauty perceiv'd from the _Works
of Nature_, _artificial Forms_, _Figures_. _Comparative_ or _Relative_ Beauty is
that which we perceive in Objects, commonly considered as _Imitations_ or
_Resemblances_ of something else. These two Kinds of Beauty employ the three
following Sections.

{#n1} See above, [Art. 6.]

{#n2} See [Art. 5.]

{#n3} [Sect. 7.]

{#n4} _This division of _Beauty_ is taken from the different _Foundations_ of
Pleasure to our Sense of it, rather than from the Objects themselves: for most
of the following Instances of relative Beauty have also absolute Beauty; and
many of the Instances of absolute Beauty, have also relative Beauty in some
respect or other. But we may distinctly consider these two _Fountains_ of
Pleasure, _Uniformity_ in the Object it self, and _Resemblance_ to some
Original._
