£2 LETTER V. £2
£2 _To_ =_Mr._ Norris=. £2

{#1} SO candid and condescending a Treatment of a Stranger, a Woman, and so
inconsiderable an one as my self, shews you to be as much above the Generality
of the World in your Practice, as you are in your Theory and Speculation.
Hitherto I have courted Truth with a kind of Romantick Passion, in spite of all
Difficulties and Discouragements: for knowledge is thought so unnecessary an
Accomplishment for a Woman, that few will give themselves the Trouble to assist
them in the Attainment of it. Not considering that the meliorating of one single
Soul is an Employment more worthy of a wise Man, than most of those things to
which Custom appropriates the Name of Business and Affairs. But now, since you
have so generously put into my Hand an Opportunity of obtaining what I so
greedily long after, that I may make the best Improvement of so great an
Advantage, I give up my self entirely to your Conduct, so far as is consistent
with a rational not blind Obedience, bring a free and unprejudiced Mind to
receive from your Hand such Gravings and Impressions as shall seem most
convenient, and though I can't engage for a prompt and comprehensive Genius, yet
I will for a docible Temper.

{#2} The Esteem I have for those necessary and useful Rules you have already
prescribed, shall appear by my strict Observation of them. For indeed the Span
of Life is too short to be trifled away in unconcerning and unprofitable
Matters; and that Soul who has any Sense of a better Life, can't chuse but
desire that every Minute of her Time may be employed in the regulating of her
Will with the most critical Exactness, and the extending her Understanding to
its utmost Stretch, that so she may obtain the most enlarg'd Knowledge and ample
Fruition of _GOD_ her only Good, that her Nature is capable of. I will therefore
pass on to explain a little what I asserted in my last, next add a few Thoughts
concerning Divine Love, and in the last place a Proposal or two for the better
Prosecution of those you have already made.

{#3} Now in order to the first, I am very well satisfied that _GOD_ is the Cause
of Mental as well as Bodily Pain, if by mental Pain you understand Grief, my
Mistake lying in this, that I confounded Sin and mental Pain. 'Tis indeed
evident that Sin and Grief are two distinct things; yet I cannot form to my self
any Idea of Sin which does not include in it the greatest Pain and Misery. For
as Sin is the meritorious Cause of all Misery, so it seems to me that the
Punishment of Sin is concomitant to the Act; Misery is inseparable from Sin, and
the Sinner is _ipso~facto_ punished. When therefore I said that mental Pain is
the same with Sin, I meant no more than this, that as a musical Instrument, if
it were capable of Sense and Thought`, wou'd be uneasie and in pain when harsh
discordant Notes are plaid upon it, so Man, when he breaks the Law of his Nature
and runs counter to those Motions his Maker has assign'd him, when he
contradicts the Order and End of his Being must needs be in Pain and Misery. And
as the Health and Perfection, Ease and Pleasure, Good and Happiness (or whatever
you will call it) of a Creature consists in its Conformity to the End of its
Creation, and the being in such Circumstances as are agreeable to its Nature,
from which when in the least it deviates it loses both its Beauty and its
Pleasure; so the Soul of Man being made on purpose for the Contemplation and
Love of _GOD_ whensoever it ceases to pursue that End, must needs be put out of
the Order of its Nature, and consequently depriv'd of all Pleasure and
Perfection, whilst it stands rightly affected towards _GOD_ it cannot be
destitute of Pleasure, but whatsoever sets it in Opposition to him does by that
Act deprive it of all Delight.

{#4} So that my Hypothesis will lie thus: That although _GOD_ only has Power to
modifie the Soul of Man, and to affect it with Pain and Grief, yet since these
are rather _Uneasinesses_ than Evils strictly so call'd (nothing according to my
Notion being the proper Evil of Man but Sin, of which more anon) since they are
design'd by _GOD_ as Mediums to good, and are, if not formally, yet at least
consequentially Occasions of Pleasure; since the wilful and affected Ignorance
of the Understanding and Pravity of the Will, or in other Words Sin is the true
and proper Evil of a Man, because Sin only is absolutely and directly opposite
to the Essence of Goodness; and seeing _GOD_ can no way be said to be the Author
of Sin, consequently his being the Cause of our uneasie Sensations, can be no
just Bar to our Love, much less any Motive to our Aversion.

{#5} As for the Distinction of the Soul into inferiour and superiour Part, I am
as little satisfied with it as you can be, and do confess to you ingeniously
that I have no clear Idea of that which is properly my self, nor do I well know
how to distinguish its Powers and Operations: For the usual Accounts that are
given of the Soul are very unsatisfactory, that in your Letter being the best I
have met with and therefore for want of better Expressions, I made use of this
Distinction, which I did the more readily because I learned it from your
[_Christian Blessedness_, P. 158.] All the remaining Difference therefore lies
in this Question, _whether Sin be the only Evil?_ And in order to the removing
it, I shall first shew you my Design in affirming that it is, and then the
Reasons that incline me to it, and when I have done so I will refer all to your
better Judgment.

{#6} First, for what I aim at, I have observ'd that most of the Folly and
Mischief that is in the World proceeds from false Notions of Pain and Pleasure,
and Mistakes concerning the Nature of good and evil. For would Men be perswaded
that GOD is their only good, so they might enjoy him they would not much regret
the Absence of other things; neither would they so greedily pursue the Shell of
Pleasure, nor fix their Hearts on sensible Objects which can never satisfie. And
were they but convinced that nothing is so evil as Sin, they would not _choose
Iniquity rather than Affliction._ As therefore your Account of Pleasure does
rectifie the Errors of our Love, so I could wish that our Aversions were better
regulated than they usually are; and that Sin, which though it be not the
_efficient,_ is yet the _moral Cause_ of all our Evils and Displeasures, were so
represented as that it might appear the only proper and adequate Object of our
intire Hatred and Aversion. This is my Design.

{#7} Now for the Reasons (besides what are already intimated) which incline me
to think that Sin is the only Evil. I grant that whatever is contrary to the
Pleasure and Good of Man in any of his Capacities, may in some Sense be call'd
an Evil, and in this Latitude no doubt but that both mental and sensible Pain
are Evils. But because, when we speak of Evil we usually understand something
that in its own Nature is the proper Object of our Aversion, evil as evil being
no way eligible; and since mental and bodily Pain are not so far evil but that
in some Circumstances they may become eligible, which yet they could not be
without assuming the Nature of good, and therefore they are not pure and
absolute Evils. And further, though 'tis easie in our Contemplations and
Retirements to distinguish between greater and lesser Evils, to compare and
weigh them together, and to allot to each its due Proportion of Choice or
Aversion, yet since good and evil do frequently present themselves to our Minds
in common Conversation and Business, when we have neither Time nor Appetite to
abstract and consider, but are determin'd by this short and obvious Sillogism,
"Evil is not eligible, but such a thing is Evil, therefore it is not to be
chosen": Whereas perhaps that which we refuse as evil (suppose bodily or mental
Pain) though formally, and in the greatest Latitude of the Word it be an Evil,
yet comparatively and $pro hic & nunc$, in may be a Good, and so the proper
Object of our Choice. To avoid which common Occasion of Mistake, and because the
Nature of Man has so strong an Aversion to every thing that bears the Name of
Evil, I wou'd rather call Grief and Pain _Uneasinesses_ than Evils, and wholly
appropriate the Name of Evil to Sin, which is[n1] essentially and absolutely
Evil and the only entire Object of a rational Creatures Hatred and Aversion.

{#8} But not to contend about Words, admitting that Pain and Grief are Evils, it
is but in a comparative and lower Sense; if they were essentially Evil, they
could not in some Circumstances become good, which you your self allow them to
be _occasionally_ and _consequentially,_ and as they may be a Means to avoid a
greater Evil. Whereas the very[n1] Essence of Sin is evil, it can never in any
Circumstance be eligible, which is a Sign it is never good. We may not commit a
lesser Sin under Pretence to avoid a greater, but we _may,_ nay we _ought_ to
endure the greatest Pain and Grief rather than commit the least sin. For (not to
dispute what Good _GOD_ may bring out of the Sins of Men, or how he does it,
which are Questions I will not now meddle with) I have always thought that the
least moral Evil is not to be chosen, no not in order to the greatest Good, as I
think may be inferred from the Apostles arguing, [_Rom._ 3. 8.] there is a
certain Peculiarity of Evil in Sin, which (though you will not allow it the only
Evil, yet at least) renders it an Evil paramont to all other Evils, and excludes
it from the least degree of Eligibility. For though Pain and Grief put the Soul
into uneasie Circumstances, yet they don't withdraw her from her true Good, they
rather excite her more strongly to cleave to him, and that Trouble which
sensible things occasion, and which she feels through the Disorder of her own
Thoughts, stirs her up to fix more firmly on him, whose Comforts in this Case
are her only Refreshment, whereas Sin quite alienates the Soul from her only
true Good, and thereby deprives her of the sole Prop she has to rest on, and
consequently puts her in the most wretched, helpless and evil Condition. Every
thing but Sin has something of good in it, because every thing else proceeds
from _GOD;_ but Sin is all over perfect Deformity, an uncompounded Evil, and a
direct Contradiction to Order and Perfection, and consequently to Pleasure, and
therefore is, or ought to be, set at the greatest Opposition to the Nature of
Man, and to be the proper Object of his intire Hatred and Aversion. This is the
Point I drive at, and if it may be gained am very indifferent whether it be by
mine, or some other Way of arguing.

{#9} But before I proceed to the next Particular I have two Requests, one is,
That you would please to oblige me with a Definition of Pleasure; and the other,
That you would a little explain the Idea of Pain, for I don't well understand
your Meaning when you say, _That Pain anticipates all Thought` or Reflection;_ I
did suppose it to be an _uneasie Thought`_, and how then can it anticipate all
Thought`? The Bodily Impression indeed prevents Thought`, but that is not
properly the Pain but the Occasion of it.

{#10} Now in the next place to gratifie your Desire which falls in so much with
my own Inclinations, _That I should further communicate my Thoughts concerning
divine Love;_ a Subject on which 'tis easie to be endless, and yet impossible to
say too much: I take it to be the Sum and Substance of all Religion, to which
all other Duties are reducible, which are but so many different Modifications of
this Soul that animates the Christian Life: And therefore such Discourses as
serve to lay its Foundation deep, and raise its superstructure high, such as
bring it Fuel by rational Motives, and fan its Flame by devout and relishing
Expressions, do the Work of Religion all at once; for were this Divine Principle
but once firmly rooted in our Hearts, and suffered to display it self in all its
necessary Effects and Consequences, 'twould supercede all other Instructions,
and be instead of a Thousand Monitors.

{#11} The Love of _GOD_ is both the best Preservative against Evil (in its
greatest Latitude) and the strongest Impellent to good. 'Tis the best Antidote
against Sin, in that it disarms Temptations of all their Force, they cannot
fasten upon the Soul that entirely loves its Maker. He who believes _GOD_ to be
his only Good, if he attend at all to that Conviction, can never wilfully sin
against him. For Sin being a Disconformity to _GOD,_ a willing something
contrary to his Nature and Will, 'tis not possible for a Man to chuse that which
he believes to be contrary to his only Good, and which will therefore
consequently deprive him of it. And it being nothing else but the false
Appearance of some seeming Good that inclines a Man to chuse amiss, he who
considers _GOD_ as his only Good, and loves him with an Entireness of Affection,
has shut up all the Avenues of his Soul from that _Syren_ apparent Good, and is
not capable of being bewitch'd by it. Indeed if we allow the Creature to be in
any degree our good, 'tis hard to keep our selves from desiring it, and if we
permit Desire, we can never be secure from irregular Love, that Shame and Misery
of Mankind, it being easier not to desire at all than to desire with Moderation.
For Love is an insinuating Passion, and where-ever 'tis admitted, will spread
and make its Way. And though the Charms of the Creature be infinitely unworthy
to rival those of the Creator, yet they have this Advantage, that they
perpetually press upon the outward Man, and constantly present themselves to our
Senses, so that if we allow them the least Share in our Hearts, 'tis odds but
that at last they wholly withdraw it from him who only has a Right to it.

{#12} And as the Love of _GOD_ secures our Innocence, so it makes the best
Provision for our Pleasure. The Soul of Man may as well cease to _be_ as cease
to love; something or other it must desire, but so long as it moves towards the
Creature, it may amuse its Cravings but can never satisfie them. How often will
the Objects of our Love be wanting? How often will the Objects of our Love be
wanting? How often will they be unkind? And suppose them as present and as kind
as we can wish them, shall we not be as sick of our Fruitions as we were of our
Desires? For what is there in the Creature but Emptiness, Vanity and Vexation?
But the Object of Divine Love is always essentially present, nothing can hide
him from us but our own Neglect; if we do but fix the Eyes of our Understanding
on, and direct the Motions of our Will towards him, we may always contemplate
and enjoy his Beauty; may always asswage our Thirst at this Fountain, and feast
our hungry Souls upon his never-failing Charms, which though they will still
draw us on to pursue a further Enjoyment, because of their infinite Amability
and Perfection, yet all along they will satisfie and fill our Souls with
unspeakable Delight; though they don't extinguish all Desire, yet they will
remove all Emptiness, and at once replenish our Faculties and enlarge them! But
these ravishing Delights which the enamoured Soul feels in every Approach to her
Divine Lover are better felt than expressed, and when we have once tasted of
these most sapid Pleasures, we shall for ever disdain the muddy Streams of
sensual Delights!

{#13} Thus the Love of _GOD_ defends us from the Uneasiness of Pain and Grief,
as well as from the Evil of Sin, and makes us happy in all our Capacities. It is
so Divine a Cordial, that the least Drop of it is able to sweeten and outweigh
all the Troubles of this present State, and render the most Calamitous Condition
not only _easie_ but _joyous._ For it gives an Anticipation of those Joys in
which it will at last invest us, brings down Heaven into our Bosoms e're it
carries us up thither; and were it but largely shed abroad in our Hearts, we
should be out of the Reach of Fortune, might slight and trample on all
Afflictions. Though the Arrows of Pain and Grief should ruffle our Skin, they
could not touch our Hearts; or they might touch but could not hurt us!

{#14} Finally, to what Heights of Piety will not this Divine Principle elevate
the amorous Soul! For what can be too difficult to do to acquire a more perfect
Enjoyment of what we love? What can be too hard to suffer for the sake of that
Object that hath won our Heart? 'Tis nothing else that cramps our Endeavours,
and slackens our Industry after one of the brightest Crowns of Glory, but the
dividing our Love between _GOD_ and Mammon. If a foolish ill-grounded Passion
can many times excite the Soul in which it dwells to do things beyond it self,
If the Love of dirty Clay, or popular Breath can reconcile us to Fatigues and
Distresses, and many things very uneasie to our Animal Nature, shall not the
most rational and becoming Love, that Love which is the End and Perfection of
our Beings, which is secured from Disappointment, Jealousie, and all that long
Train of Pain and Grief which attends Desire when it moves towards the Creature,
set us above all Difficulties, render our Obedience regular constant and
vigorous, refine and sublimate our Natures, and make us become Angels even
whilst we dwell on Earth?

{#15} In the last Place for the Proposals I am to make. When you think we have
sufficiently examined the Subject we are upon, I desire the Favour of you to
furnish me with such a System of Principles as I may relie on, and to give me
such Rules as you judge most convenient to initiate a raw Disciple in the Study
of Philosophy; least for want of laying a good Foundation, I give you too much
Trouble, by drawing Conclusions from false Premises, and making use of improper
Terms.

{#16} I have no more to add but my repeated Thanks for that great Condescention
you continue to shew to __(Worthy Sir,) ____Your most obliged #December 12.
1693.# ______and humble Servant.

{#n1} The Reader is desired to take Notice that no more is meant by these
Phrases, than that Sin in its own Nature or Formality is entirely evil, it has
neither Form nor Beauty that we should desire it, can never be ordinable to a
good End, is none of GOD's Creatures, and therefore has not any the least Degree
of Goodness in it, is neither eligible for its own sake, nor upon any other
Account whatsoever.
