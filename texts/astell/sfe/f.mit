£1 AN ESSAY OF Friendship. BEING A Letter to a Friend, who was in Distress. £1

{#1} I Am extreamly concerned to see you have so ill an opinion of me, as to
hide your self from me in your misfortune, and let me hear it by another hand; I
know not how to interpret this shyness in you, it makes me fear you never
esteemed me worthy of your friendship, if you could imagin the change of your
Circumstances should alter my Love; I had a different notion of our mutual
obligations, and should have thought it a wrong to your generous temper, to have
concealed any thing of consequence that had hapned to me, tho it had been to
lessen me never so much in the world (which respects people according to the
port they live in); I hoped till now you had put the same confidence me, who had
nothing to recommend me to your favour, but the plain sincerity of Soul; if you
should not be welcome to me in the meanest habit, I could not deserve your
company at all; but far be such mercenary base inclinations from my breast, who
have more pleasure in dividing a small fortune with my friends, then in hoarding
up, or injoying the greatest treasures without them; and since I never valued
any person for having a splendid equipage, I am extreamly confounded to find I
have appeared so unlike my self to you, (for what else can make you avoid me,
when it is in my power to be serviceable to you, unless you question my will to
do it) I dare not quarrel with you now, lest it confirms your design of breaking
our correspondence, which is as dear to me as ever, yet give me leave to
complain of a greater loss then yours, the loss of my Friend; for now I perceive
it is in the power of adverse fortune, to draw you from me; and let me tell you,
those apprehensions that made you estrange your self, must at the same time
accuse me of Pride and Coveteousness, as well as ingratitude, the first of which
sins would be more unpardonable in me, then the rest of my Sex; but I always
knew my own defects well enough to stifle any such suggestions; nor could I ever
boast of any advantage so much, as being made happy by your kindness; and since
every Soul is not capable of faithfulness, the Character you gave of me for
being so, together with your distinguishing me in your confidence, above the
rest of your friends, did indeed elevate me with joy (tho not to ostentation)
but you have sufficiently mortifyed me now, by shewing me your trust was not
absolute; and that you believed I loved you only as long as you were in humor
for Diversions, or else I had some sinister ends, which are disappointed by this
turn in your affairs; I think I can scarce be charged with crimes I have a much
greater antipathy to then these I have mentioned, as Coveteousness is the root
of all Evil, it is an Enemy to all good, (which I must ever account Friendship
to be) that person that delights only in money can have no lasting satisfaction,
for as it is the nature of riches to make themselves wings, and fly away, the
miser that locks them never so fast in his trunk, is so sensible of their
fleeting qualities, that he has as many racking meditations about them, as if
they were already out of his reach, his sleep is interrupted and all tyes of
nature are broke; he regards a poor relation with as much aversion and caution
as he can do a theif; as for Fendship he has not the impudence (or as he thinks
weakness) to pretend to it, lest he bring in a partner to his wealth; for many
of those sordid wretches, will acknowledge such an intimacy does oblige us to
the utmost of our powers, to help each other, and therefore they not being
desirous to give a title to any part of their Estate, will keep out of the
temptation; by which means, they want the chiefest comfort of humane life; a
Coveteous Man after many years denying himself all Conveniencies (as well as
duties) if he gets the reputation of being rich, may be courted by them who have
an expectation from him, but he receives their addresses very warily, being
conscious to himself, that he deserves nothing of civility, and jealous still of
a design upon his Coffers, where he knows his only attraction lies; if he gets
any presents upon trust of a double return at his Death, this _Janus_ may look
with smiles upon his Benefactors, but his affectionate face is always fixt
towards his Gold; which yet he knows not how soon he must leave, if it does not
leave him first; but sometimes the miserable wretch meets a disappointment in
his darling hopes; and by an unforeseen fate is reduced to the real want, which
his greedy desire of money imposed upon him, even in the midst of plenty; he may
then too late wish he had made himself friends, with the Mammon of
unrighteousness, for he finds no body willing to receive him, and does in vain
groan for that blessing which he declined in his prosperity, and would have
proved of more advantage then all his ill got treasure; I mean a true friend,
for they will not be wanting to help and to assist one another, in all
exigencies, with their purse and advise; but they that will know no body when it
is in their power to oblige, will find no body know them in their extremity; as
a late _French_ Author well observes, out of whose ingenious writings I have
collected some choice remarks, which I hope may be not only an entertainment,
but an assistance to you in your present circumstances. The world is grown so
very bad, that there is little faith left amongst us; nor gratitude for any
kindness, the best services are too often the worst requited; we should
therefore observe peoples behaviour, in their Correspondencies with others, not
to imitate their treachery, but to stand so much upon our guard that we may not
be sufferers by it; Those that are too easy to believe, do many times when it is
too late find themselves mistaken, yet we ought to be cautious in shewing a
distrust of the truth of another, that being an unnecessary rudeness unto them,
and if it amounts to the degree of suspecting every body, it is an indication of
falsehood in our selves, for a lyer can neither believe nor be believed; but
upon the first report of any thing, it is most prudent to suspend our Judgment,
unless we know the integrity of him that speaks it; yet the safest way of all to
avoid being partial, is not to make any conclusion till we hear both sides; how
unjust are they, whose understandings are so ingaged towards one party, that
truth can make no impression on them; but continue wedded to their opinion,
beyond the power of reason to separate them from it; the best interpretation
that can possibly be put upon such pernicious practises, is a defect in their
capacity; tho 'tis ten to one their honesty is chiefly suspected and most in
fault: The greatest part of our life is spent in information, and that which is
visible to us is least essential; we take most things on the words of others,
and that makes us generally imposed upon; we commonly know the truth of what we
see, but seldom of what we hear, especially if it come from far (which should
make us more circumspect in what we give credit to) for when a relation of a
thing has passed through several hands, it has so many glosses put upon it by
the passions, or interest of them that recount it, as makes it never arrive pure
and unmixt to our ears; Let us therefore consider, whether they which speak of
any person, or thing are unbyass'd; and if they are not, we must give grains of
allowance for their praises, and much more for their dispraises, since the
depraved temper of most men is stronglier inclined to be spightful, then good
natured; it is those slanders that are spoken behind our backs (to undiscerning
men) that does us mischief, for a wise person will gain a greater advantage from
the censure of their enemies, for what they do amiss, if they hear it, then a
fool will take from the advice of his friends, which seldom prevails with him;
the envious holds a glass to shew us our faults, and we ought to correct them in
our selves, and not retaliate their railings.

{#2} We should indeavour to live peaceable with every body, and disoblige none
willingly; for any person is capable of being an enemy, but not all of doing
friendships; nor is it prudent to be over forward in ingaging our selves in any
tyes, either in Love or Friendship (more then what Christianity commands us to
have for all men) yet when we have made a Protestation of Amity, no generous
Soul will brake the correspondence, tho they meet some inconveniencies in it;
but if the division is inevitable, will be sure it shall be justifyable on their
sides; however, both parties will be condemned, where there is a rupture betwixt
friends, either for want of consideration in the beginning, or of constancy in
the end; the spectators of their differences do every one represent it as they
please, (or at least as they think), and they Judge according as they Love; it
is better to decline making a promise then to repent of it afterwards; a
disobliged friend often proves the worst of enemies, and where you find a
disappointment in them, a coldness is better then a quarrel; for contention
generally ruines our reputation, emulation causing people to discover those
failings, that our civility had made them overlook; the heat of dispute Animates
the Spirits, and raises up that infamy which was dead before; our Antagonists
thinking to confound if they cannot confute us, begin with a _manifesto_ of
invectives, (that is supposing them as ill as they set us forth to be) for those
are Arms unworthy a vertuous person to make use of; Let us therefore strive to
have a concern with none that are not so, their goodness being a defence against
ill language as well as falsehood; for they would always act like themselves;
but there is no security, when we treat with those that are not guided by Reason
nor Justice▪ with such we should not have a difference, and much less contract a
friendship, for whatsoever affection we must express, we must remember all is
not Gold that glisters, and theirs is subject to a base alloy, which is apparent
enough to make us fly them, that have no Principles of honour, for honour is the
truest pledge of faithfulness, and we can be safe with none without it.

{#3} The greatest benefit we can receive from riches, is their enabling us to do
more good then those that have less; a good estate is a charge that we must give
an account of, and leads us into many inconveniencies, if we have no friend to
regulate our unruly Appetites. A person that is rich is certainly flattered, and
they must love us very well, that will venture their own interests to represent
us truly to our selves; which is the most requisite of any knowledge, tho it is
unwillingly received by most people; a proud Man is hurried into many other
vices, because none dares show him the odiousness of his carriage; for he that
keeps all his acqaintance at a distance, if he is falling down a precipice has
no body near enough to stop him; but a friend will kindly advertise us of those
evils, for the which an enemy would expose us, and perhaps the very people who
have betrayed us into it, shall be the first to trumpet our disgrace; such
treatment is absolutely against the Laws of Friendship, since that injoyns us to
conceal, as well as strive to rectify each others errors; and is a chain that
proves of greater security to us, the more firmly it is linked; he that stands
alone, cannot be so strong as he that is supported, nor is any help (from this
world) so ready and substantial, as that which proceeds from a true affection;
tho alas, there is but little of that to be found in the age we live in, and it
is this decay of kindness, which occasions the ruine of so many families, for if
there are several branches, it is not likely they should all be prosperous, but
where they are united they seldom fall; we were born, next to serving God, to
serve our Neighbours, and especially those of our own blood, which may be Policy
as well as Duty, since we all want assistance in our turns, and a rich person
has as much need of Counsel as one in a meaner Station has of relief; but
whatsoever our Circumstances are, we should omit no opportunity of being
serviceable to the rest of mankind; those that have a considerable fortune to
dispose of, should let their friends injoy a necessary share of it so easily,
that it may not appear like a gift, but as if they had an equal Title to it; and
in all conditions we should aid the distressed to the utmost of our power, never
following their examples, who are morose to all about them, not only to avoid
the trouble of obliging, but from an Antipathy they have to all good nature;
directly opposite to the Divine goodness, who is incessantly communicating his
benefits to us; we ought in prudence to manage our Conversation with such an
agreeable pleasantness (bounded by discretion) that people may delight in our
companies; for all the goods of this life would be worth nothing, if we were to
possess them alone, but we are sure to have either friends or enemies about us;
and almost every day ingages the world to be more or less kind to us; let us
therefore carry our selves so, that tho we do not desire to make many
confidents, we may at least gain the esteem of all that know us; for with
friends all things are well accepted that are meant so; they put no ill
constructions upon each others words; kindness sweetens all our cares, and takes
away the constraint we are in before them, that are indifferent or spightful to
us; as in Summer we must provide against Winter, we should make our selves so
well beloved in prosperity, as to reap the fruit of it in adversity; if we have
an alteration in our affairs, which are subject to mutation as long as we
continue upon Earth, and some have been forced to crouch to those they once
disdained to smile on; Humility and Complacensy have this reward, that they
never fail to bring glory to those that exercise them, they add a lustre to the
brightest ornaments, and if a change of fortune happens, their beauty is not
sullied by Poverty; for the honour of an humble person remains, tho all their
other circumstances are altered, and an obliging word or look costs us nothing;
therefore we may afford that; when we are reduced never so low, it will not only
procure us esteem whilst we live, but make us be lamented when we die; a mild
and charitable person imprints such Love, such Reverence in all that know him,
as will not end with his life, but his memory will be respected; and when he
goes from this world, it will be to his own comfort and other peoples grief;
whilst a severe haughty man, tho he hugs himself with the conceit of keeping
others in awe, will not only fall unpittied, but being considered for nothing
besides his power to do mischief, if his Station alters, will find that fear
turned into hatred; nor can his death be regretted, it being for the publick
good to have so ill an example removed.

{#4} If incivility proceeds from Pride, it is a base effect from a worse cause,
which never proves of advantage to those that nourish it; if it is from
ignorance, we shall be dispised for not informing our selves better, since those
who have not had an opportunity of fine breeding, may learn a civil
candescention; and that we owe to every body, even our very enemies, for we must
pity and assist them in their necessities, and neither affront them nor proclaim
their failings; it is a sign of our leading an ill life, if we carry a register
of the wicked actions of others, and it is the consolation of fools only to be
satisfyed with their own sins, because another's are of something a deeper dye;
yet too many are as violent in decrying those debaucheries they imitate, as if
they were provoked by the steps they made in Vice beyond themselves, and whilst
they rail, still run to overtake them.

{#5} Let us on the contrary, be strict in observing our own ways, and easy in
the interpretation we put upon others.

{#6} A generous person will speak well of those that are not his friends, as far
as truth permits, and where he cannot, will be silent; since it is much better
to be so, then to say that which will prostitute our Neighbours reputation; but
to magnify his faults with all the severity we can invent, is to make our
tongues like the poison of a Serpent, whose bite is mortal, and will render us
as detestable as they are.

{#7} A wise man will be moderate to all his discourses, and particularly in
giving the Character of others, not being transported into a heat, whether they
are friends or enemies he mentions; nor hyperbolizing in the commendation of
people that are deserving, for excessive praise awakens curiosity, and provokes
envy to look into their failings; and every one appears the worse that has been
too much extolled before hand; but besides the disadvantage we bring upon our
friends, in having so mighty expectations to satisfy, if they fall short of what
we have represented them, we must bring our own sincerity or Judgment in
question; but we should least of all describe our selves, since we are so unable
to Judge rightly in that point, to commend our selves in an abominable vanity;
and to discommend our selves, is to beg a complement, and both ways we put the
company in pain, either to forbear laughing at our conceitedness, or to find
something to say, which they think will answer our expectations, tho they do not
believe one word of it themselves, but they who delight to hear no bodies tongue
in motion, but their own, are liable to these and many other errors; and the
most watchful may sometimes need a friend to reprimand them; for tho
Conversation is the ordinary exercise of life, we must consider how small a slip
in it may ruine our reputation, which is of inestimable price, and is never in
more danger then when we keep company with those that have none of their own to
lose; whatsoever charms they possess, if vertue is wanting, our fame will
quickly be like theirs, and friendship will then divide the ill, as well as the
good of this world betwixt us; why should we for any diversions incourage a
reprobate person, and run the risque of being esteemed so our selves.

{#8} It is every bodies happiness to have wise friends, if they have wit enough
to be advised by them; they which love truly are firm as a Diamond, and as hard
to break; but some capricious people are like glass, so brittle and dangerous to
touch, that it is impossible to have a correspondence with them, without being
in constraint; the least _punctilio_ that you omit, makes a flaw in the
acquaintance, they are continual discontents to themselves and others; they who
would keep their favour must study their humors, and dares scarce stir before
them, lest they should be offended at their motions; they are fond of nothing
but themselves, and being slaves to their own wills, expect their friends should
be so too; we should be careful whom we receive into that intimacy; if they are
well principled, the correspondency will be mingled with pleasure and profit;
but amongst the generallity of people, freedom in discourse is of ill
consequence, lest we furnish them with Arms to destroy us, if they become our
Enemies; and we often see those that express kindness to us to day, are most
ready to do us an injury to morrow, and they are capable of making the more
cruel war upon us, if they know our weakness: Tho we may be sensible when we are
treated ill, and shew a reasonable resentment, yet in all quarrels, we should
leave a door open for reconciliation, and put a curb to all thoughts of revenge;
for if we give liberty to such inclinations, we may do that in our passion that
may out-ballance the delight of punishing another; and a religious person finds
a greater satisfaction in pardoning, then in returning an affront, rejoicing
when they have an opportunity to overcome evil with good.

{#9} But some are very far from this temper, who will take part with those that
are in the wrong, if their enemies have a dispute with him, only to oppose the
man they hate, not reflecting that they hurt themselves most, if he has the
sense to espouse the right side; they show great folly that are against him,
only for contradiction sake, which would be more inexcusable then if they did
it, through a defect in their understandings; but those who are guided by virtue
and goodness, will act quite otherways, knowing a positive spightfulness makes
all conversation uneasy, and many times those that think to show their wit by
disputing, proclaime their ill nature only, and give their adversary cause to
triumph; we should rather imitate the Bee then the Spider, as the Bee
industriously sucks the sweets from every flower, so let us make the best of all
cross accidents, and then the counsels of our friends will prove as honey to us;
but they whose envious disposition observe the worst they can in every
discourse, are like the Spider that swells with the Venom, he extracts where're
he goes: they that cannot bear a private, friendly reproof, are as big with
conceitedness, as any of those insects I mentioned, can be with the most
Poysonous Exhalation: It is a misfortune to be allied to such a Person, but when
we fall into his Hands, we must not spend our Time in _Fruitless Lamentations_;
For Complaints do often cause Disdain, and the _World_ is so Inhumane, that
instead of moving Compassion, the Injuries we Receive from one, encourages
another (of as ill a principle) to accumulate our wrongs; it is best to conceal
the rudenesses we suffer, and cannot remedy, and acknowledge the favours that
are conferr'd upon us; which is Policy, as well as Gratitude, since it many
times excites those that hear us to be as kind; but that proud heart who will
not own his obligations to his friends, does justly deserve to be contemned by
every body; and when he finds himself slighted upon that score, it must be an
aggravation to his misery, to consider how much his own insensibility
contributed to his ruine.

{#10} They who do their duties, are the best prepared to undergo what we call
the frowns of fortune, and making a good use of their afflictions, will find a
happy end of them; and enable us to be serene in those hurricanes of life, that
are apt to shock the steddiest brain, where we can meet no haven of safety, but
in the hand of Divine Providence; let us therefore wait patiently upon him, till
he pleases to make a turn in our affairs, knowing that we can as much calm the
raging of the Seas as alter his will.

{#11} Fretting at our Circumstances renders our Judgment less able to Act, and
decays our health, a troubled water may grow clear without, but never with
stirring in it; yet sorrow is scarce supportable alone, therefore they are
doubly wretched that have none to ease their mind in trouble; and tho other
people may be so barbarous to neglect, or use them worse for what they suffer
already, if they have made a good choice in placing their friendship, they need
not apprehend such a treatment; tho indeed there is so much baseness in this
age, that they ought to know them very well in whom they confide.

{#12} Some are incapable of keeping a secret, their minds being like an unsealed
letter, it is not prudence to commit any thing of Consequence to them; these are
quickly to be found out, and are as certainly dispised; a cunning person, is yet
more dangerous, for they pretend to design our interests, whilst they promote
their own, tho it be to our destruction.

{#13} But religious persons will preserve their Faith inviolable to their
friend, and never disclose what they are intrusted with, which gains them the
esteem of all that knows it; but if they had nothing paid them, in return they
will not fail to discharge a good conscience, and not only conceal their friends
concerns, but account it a great felicity to be serviceable to them (as without
all doubt it is a much more substantial pleasure to give, then to receive a
favour) a compassionate temper never sees another in discontent, without bearing
a part with him; but friendship should carry us yet further, and divide the care
and grief equally betwixt us.

{#14} Nor shall you ever find me wanting in demonstrating the truth of what I
have so often professed; for I did not instance these maxims as things of
course; but because many of the rules suited with my own thoughts, and I shall
omit no opportunity to convince you, that according to the strictest rules of
Friendship, //
~~~~_I am Yours._
