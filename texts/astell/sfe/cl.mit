£1 AN ESSAY UPON Crosses in Love, IN A Letter to a Friend, whose Lover Married
another and left her Basely. £1

{#1} OUR Expectation of happiness is (generally) so ill placed from all things
in this Life, that it is no wonder we find perpetual Disappointments in them;
but when passion makes our choice, we have so very blind a guide as will
inevitably lead us to Destruction, and tho Love appears then gentlest and best
natured of all those Troops, which daily rises in Rebellion against Religion and
Reason; yet our affections are so much the right of our Almighty Creator, that
as often as we fix them immoderately upon any of the fading objects here below
(how tempting soever they seem to us) we are certainly guilty of Sacriledge
towards the Divine Goodness, which fault is commonly punished by the very thing
we doat upon.

{#2} This (my dear Friend,) I doubt has been your Case, and not yours alone; for
soon or late, few escape that mischief, especially amongst our weaker Sex, whose
tender Nature leaves them most exposed to Ruine, and tho' they see other
Ship-wreck'd before their Eyes, will venture out to Sea on the same bottom,
insensible of danger till themselves perish and sometimes fall unpitied.

{#3} Men have a thousand advantages over us, but in the affair of Court-ship
they add cunning to all their other Accomplishments, and are as truly Zealous to
deceive us, as if their Lives (and Souls too) would be made happy by the cheat;
a sad mistake I doubt they will find it at the Last (if perjury is to be
accounted for) tho your false Traytor like many others, looks upon that time of
reckoning at a great distance. Yet since he is not sure it is so, I wish for his
own sake at least he would reflect how he could receive that sentence, Thou
fool, this night thy perjur'd Soul shall be required of thee, but I suppose he
thinks himself excused as being more knave than fool, which Title indeed is so
highly due to him, that I believe none (that knows him) will do him such
manifest wrong as to dispute it; and I am sure, the blacker he appears, the
greater cause you have to bless that Providence, which permited him to break the
Contract (since you were not in the least accessory to the parting) for without
doubt, he, that proved so ill a Lover to the best of Mistresses, would have made
an intolerable husband to the best of wives, and his ill usage would have cost
you more tears than his Infidelity (I hope) will do; tho I am sensible a heart,
so generous and constant as yours, cannot easily efface the deep impression he
has made in it; that must be the work of time with God's assistance, which I
hope will never fail you, but my weak Arguments can avail little; yet I beg you
to accept them kindly as they are meant, and pardon this Freedom, since it
proceeds from a Friendship as sincere as your own thoughts; For I do assure you,
I am deeply touched with every thing that concern you, nor is it without great
regret, that I submit to my unhappy Circumstances detaining me from being the
Companion of your saddest hours, which I should indeavour with all my power, to
divert from so ill a subject; you say it is a daily aggravation to your trouble,
to think you suffered your self to be so blindly imposed on, but that as I told
you before is but our common, alas, too common fate, tho all Impostours are not
so industriously wicked, and you ought not to condemn your own Judgment, for
want of discovering a cheat, that blinded all the witnesses of his pretensions
to you; they must be well versed in Villany that could imagine a Man should take
such extraordinary pains to gain your kindness, for no other end but only to
make you miserable in this world, and himself so in the next; 'tis true, when a
Man of no fortune Courts a woman that is very Rich, prudence obliges her to
stand upon her Guard, and to be well informed of her Lover's Principles, before
she gives Credit to his Vows; for she that is content to lessen her self in
Gratitude to a Man's affections, and neglect her own Advancement, ought to take
particular care she does not sell her Estate and person for nothing; yet after
all the caution she can possibly use, she may (too late) find her self deceived,
for he that seeks his own Establishment seldom wants Hypocrisie to act what part
he pleases.

{#4} I have lately seen a deplorable instance of this in poor old _Delia,_ who
at fourscore married young _Strephon_ in pitty to his sufferings, being
convinced by a thousand proofs that he could not live without her (tho she has
since had aboundant cause to repent of her Charity) but he was at the trouble of
Counterfeiting a good while, and had the art to look pale, sigh and languish
violently for her, her money I mean (the only charm she was mistress of) which
so dazled his Eyes, that he had been married to her three days before he
perceived she wanted an Eye; however, his apprehension is grown much quicker
since, and now he discovers so many Imperfections in her, as he fancies will
justify all his ill usage, which is indeed sufficient to need a greater excuse.

{#5} When she reproaches him with his perfidiousness, he tells her, if her
understanding had not been as blind as her left Eye, she must have discerned
what he aimed at; when she scolds he laughs, and says, she had better forbear
barking now she has no teeth to bite; those that are near her tells me, he has
made her distracted; but I believe he found her so, or else she would never have
entertained him upon that account; he is just going to send her into the Country
to meditate upon her good Conduct, (thinking sallads and pudding a very
convenient diet for her gums) which will give him an opportunity to injoy his
own pleasures, and her Estate with the greater freedom.

{#6} When a woman is Courted by a Man whose Circumstances are much a¦bove hers,
she should be very reserved, for it is ten to one his design is not honourable,
or if it be a modest denial will make him the more eager, as love was always
observed to increase by opposition; nor can we be too tender in the point which
concerns our reputation; these Sparks are generally more dangerous Enemies than
the last I mentioned, both as our Souls are of infinite consequence, more than
our well beings in this world and our own ambition, joining with their flattery,
helps to undo us; this bait perhaps did first insnare half the lewd women about
the Town, amongst the rest _Cloe,_ our Neighbour, is now a sufferer by it.

{#7} When _Philander_ began to visit her, all her friends gave her warning not
to trust any fair promises, nor permit her vertue so much as to be once
attempted; since as a learned pious Man says, he advances too far that comes to
be denied, for those inclinations may be check't in the beginning by a look,
that upon small incouragement will appear in the highest impudence; (as she
found by sad experience) but she was so besotted by the gaudy prospect, that she
soon forgot to keep her due distance and (consequently) he as soon lost his
respect; she feared _Coyness_ would obstruct her Grandeur which she valued
beyond all things, and had that confidence in his vows to love her Eternally,
that she believed her self the mistress of his life and fortune; but he took so
much advantage of her security as to compass his own ends, and has since got an
opportunity (by the way of wheadle) to tare those papers he had given her as a
proof of his good intentions; which, if she had preserved till now, might have
obliged him to make her some small reparation for the wrong he had done her, tho
he was too cunning to write any thing that would absolutely have bound him to
marriage (however she did falsely understand it) but she was not so nice in
keeping this writing as she ought to have been, thinking she had a stricter tye
upon him, by the mighty passion he pretended; which she now finds, is, vanisht
into Air.

{#8} When he first avoided her Conversation she raved, and was almost ready to
destroy her self, she found all the ways she tryed to recal him were
ineffectual, till at last quite tired with her importunities to return, he
plainly sent her word he was going to marry a Lady that was Rich and Vertuous,
that since she could pretend to neither of those Qualifications, she ought not
to complain; this message struck her with a sence of her own weakness, and the
good advice she had neglected; Oh, how happy such a bauk in her first amour,
might have proved, if she had grace enough to consider her Eternal good, and to
make a right use of her afflictions, but instead of imploring the mercy of that
God, whom she had so highly offended, she railed and cursed, accusing even th'
Almighty Powers of Injustice, for not being more propitious to her folly and
wickedness, when she had pass'd a month in fruitless grief, upon examining her
own heart, she discovered that in spite of her Satyrs against mankind, she could
not live without them, nor leave that wretched course of life she was entred
into; therefore her looking-glass informing her, that tears had been a very
great enemy to her beauty, she immediately resolved to use all her Art to repair
that fault, and soon after appeared in the Box at the Play-House, with as much
assurance as if she had no crime to blush for; it was there _Pamphilus_ saw her,
_Pamphilus,_ who was never insensible to the advances a Coquet made him, became
her humble admirer, and his pretensions agreeing extreamly with her designs,
they quickly contracted a close Correspondence; she expecting nothing beyond the
present Injoyment, made the most of her Diversions and his purse, and they
seemed as fond of one another as if their Souls had been united, but alass,
Love, which is built upon such a Foundation, can never continue long, and
accordingly theirs is already at an end, without much disturbance on either
side, their parting was so easy no body can tell which was weary first, they
both pretend to the Glory of Inconstancy, and to their comforts, are both
ingaged in fresh intriegues.

{#9} Pardon me Dear Madam, for this Digression, in giving you an account of
those you have some knowledge of, tho their Actions shew how little they
improved by good Acquaintance; a Letter from _London_ ought to have some News,
and I shall think my self happy, if mine can amuse your thoughts for a small
time, all the world knows their cases are not in the least parallel to yours,
yet if another's greater errors can justify our failings, their want of
foresight, to so high a Degree, should make you esteem it a less weakness in
your self, to be deluded by a person, that seemed to every one (as well as you)
to be so very good, so very faithful; it was those well Counterfeited
Accomplishments that made him master of your Affections, but since you find him,
that you took for an Angel of light, was in reality a Devil, as the cause is
removed, the effect should cease; and nothing now appearing of what you valued,
you should never more remember him but with abhorrence, nor can you envy her who
has the misfortune to be his Wife; for besides his ill Temper which is unmasked
(and has been plentifully shown in his Carriage to you of late) all these
terrible Imprecations which he used to remove your suspicions of his Integrity,
hang heavy o're his head, and will, I fear, involve his Family in Ruin;
especially since she knew, before she received him, what deep Engagements he
must break through to marry her: and I can scarce believe she could be so
conceited of her own Merits, to think he preferr'd her before you, upon any
other account but having a little more Money (though yours was equal to his
Estate, if it had been what he represented it when he first treated with your
Relations): Had she made use of her Reason, she would have hated so Mercenary a
Lover; and had she consulted either that or her Conscience, both would have
joined in warning her to flye a Serpent who had so barbarously bit another only
for cherishing him, in pity to his pretended pain: but hereafter she may see her
Error, and smart for the Wound she has helped to give you; yet as none of these
things come by Chance, and you know by whose permission they are transacted; I
doubt not you will look up to the (first) hand by whom the Blow was directed,
and yield quietly to it; I wish you could so far overcome your passion as to do
it thankfully; for all your Friends look upon it as a great Deliverance, and
time may convince you that it is so; but this I am confident you are sensible of
already, that it is designed for your good, and are so much a Christian, that
you will endeavour to make a right use of it; for whatever Idea, you have
entertained of Felicity in being his, will be abundantly greater as well as
surer, in your Contemplation of the Love and Goodness of God, who suffers us to
meet with Disappointments in this Life to make us seek our Happiness in another.
He only can give us true content, whom we seldom regard but when we are driven
to it by necessity: how remiss then should we be in doing our Duties, if all our
Undertakings were attended with success, which makes us so eager in the pursuit
of pleasure, that we can think of nothing else; tho almost every day's
Experience informs us, that it is impossible to find any delight without a
mixture of bitterness and sorrow, which one would imagin were sufficient to
drive us from placing our satisfactions in those things that perish in the
using; and the truer perfection we fancy to be in them, the more sensible shock,
each change, each deprivation gives us, what sordid poor wretches must we then
be, who, after the paying so dear for our knowledge, are still ignorant, that
what we covet incessantly is but vanity and vexation of Spirit; this we are told
by him, who had tryed all the alluring Charms of Love and Beauty, whose Quality
and Riches gave him the opportunity to gratify every Inclination, and set no
bounds to his wishes; if he found such emptiness in possession of them, it is no
wonder every one of us, must discover the same truth to our own cost, if we will
mistake it upon his experience, let us therefore resolve upon all occasions, to
submit our wills as much as we can to the will of our Heavenly Father; and then
we need not fear but he will repair all our Losses, and Redress all our wrongs,
and in lieu of a deceitful Lover whom you have lost, You will find a most
Gracious God who is constant to all those that are true to him, and severe upon
all those that are false to others.

{#10} Your Humble Servant.
