{#1} IT is evident to any one who takes a Survey of the Objects of Human
Knowledge, that they are either Ideas actually imprinted on the Senses, or else
such as are perceiv'd by attending to the Passions and Operations of the Mind,
or lastly Ideas formed by help of Memory and Imagination; either compounding,
dividing, or barely representing those originally perceiv'd in the aforesaid
ways. By Sight I have the Ideas of Light and Colours with their several Degrees
and Variations. By Touch I perceive Hard and Soft, Heat and Cold, Motion and
Resistance, _&c._ and of all these more and less either as to Quantity or
Degree. Smelling furnishes me with Odors; the Palate with Tastes, and Hearing
conveys Sounds to the Mind in all their variety of Tone and Composition. And as
several of these are observ'd to accompany each other, they come to be marked by
one Name, and so to be reputed as one Thing. Thus, for Example, a certain
Colour, Taste, Smell, Figure and Consistence having been observ'd to go
together, are accounted one distinct Thing, signified by the name _Apple_. Other
Collections of Ideas constitute a Stone, a Tree, a Book and the like sensible
Things; which as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the Passions of Love,
Hatred, Joy, Grief, _&c._

{#2} But besides all that endless variety of Ideas or Objects of Knowledge,
there is likewise something which knows or perceives them, and exercises divers
Operations, as Willing, Imagining, Remembering, _&c._ about them. This
perceiving, active Being is what I call _Mind, Spirit, Soul_ or _my Self_. By
which Words I do not denote any one of my Ideas, but a thing intirely distinct
from them, wherein they Exist, or, which is the same thing, whereby they are
Perceiv'd, for the Existence of an Idea consists in being Perceiv'd.

{#3} That neither our Thoughts, nor Passions, nor Ideas formed by the
Imagination, Exist without the Mind, is what every Body will allow. And to me it
is no less evident that the various Sensations or Ideas imprinted on the Sense,
however Blended or Combin'd together (that is whatever Objects they compose)
cannot Exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving them. I think an intuitive
Knowledge may be obtain'd of this, by any one that shall attend to what is meant
by the Term _Exist_ when apply'd to sensible Things. The Table I Write on, I
say, Exists, _i. e._ I See and Feel it, and if I were out of my Study I shou'd
say it Existed, meaning thereby that if I was in my Study I might perceive it,
or that some other Spirit actually does perceive it. There was an Odor, _i. e._
it was Smelt; There was a Sound, _i. e._ it was Heard; a Colour or Figure and it
was perceiv'd by Sight or Touch. This is all that I can understand by these and
the like Expressions. For as to what is said of the Absolute Existence of
unthinking Things without any relation to their being perceiv'd, that is to me
perfectly Unintelligible. Their _Esse_ is _Percipi_, nor is it possible they
shou'd have any Existence, out of the Minds or thinking Things which perceive
them.

{#4} It is indeed an Opinion strangely prevailing amongst Men, that Houses,
Mountains, Rivers and in a word all sensible Objects have an Existence Natural
or Real, distinct from their being perceiv'd by the Understanding. But with how
great an Assurance and Acquiescence soever, this Principle may be entertained in
the World: Yet whoever shall find in his Heart to call it in Question may, if I
mistake not, perceive it to involve a manifest Contradiction. For what are the
foremention'd Objects but the things we perceive by Sense, and what, I pray you,
do we perceive besides our own Ideas or Sensations, and is it not plainly
repugnant that any one of these or any Combination of them shou'd Exist
unperceiv'd?

{#5} If we throughly examine this Tenent, it will, perhaps, be found at Bottom
to depend on the Doctrine of _Abstract Ideas_. For can there be a nicer Strain
of Abstraction then to distinguish the Existence of sensible Objects from their
being Perceiv'd, so as to conceive them Existing Unperceiv'd? Light and Colours,
Heat and Cold, Extension and Figures, in a word the Things we See and Feel what
are they but so many Sensations, Notions, Ideas or Impressions on the Sense, and
is it possible to separate, even in thought, any of these from Perception? For
my part I might as easily divide a Thing from it Self. I may, indeed, divide in
my Thoughts or conceive apart from each other those Things which, perhaps, I
never perceiv'd by Sense so divided. Thus I imagine the Trunk of a Human Body
without the Limbs, or conceive the Smell of a Rose without thinking on the Rose
it self. So far I will not deny I can Abstract, if that may properly be called
_Abstraction_, which extends only to the conceiving separately such Objects, as
it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder. But my
conceiving or imagining Power does not extend beyond the possibility of real
Existence or Perception. Hence as it is impossible, for me to See or Feel any
Thing without an actual Sensation of that Thing, so is it impossible for me to
conceive in my Thoughts any sensible Thing or Object distinct from the Sensation
or Perception of it. In truth the Object and the Sensation are the same thing,
and cannot therefore be Abstracted from each other.

{#6} Some Truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a Man need only
open his Eyes to see 'em. Such I take this Important one to be, _viz._ that all
the Choir of Heaven and Furniture of the Earth, in a word all those Bodies which
compose the mighty Frame of the World, have not any Subsistence without a Mind,
that their _Esse_ is to be Perceiv'd or Known; that consequently so long as they
are not actually Perceiv'd by Me, or do not Exist in my Mind or that of any
other Created Spirit, they must either have no Exsistence at all, or else
subsist in the Mind of some Eternal Spirit: It being perfectly unintelligible
and involving all the Absurdity of Abstraction, to attribute to any single part
of them an Existence independent of a Spirit. To make this appear with all the
Light and Evidence of an Axiom, it seems sufficient if I can but awaken the
Reflexion of the Reader, that he may take an impartial View of his own Meaning,
and turn his Thoughts upon the Subject it self, free and disengaged from all
Embarras of Words and Prepossession in favour of received Mistakes.

{#7} From what has been said, 'tis evident, there is not any other Substance
than _Spirit_ or that which perceives. But for the fuller Demonstration of this
Point, let it be consider'd, the sensible Qualities are Colour, Figure, Motion,
Smell, Taste, _&c. i. e._ the Ideas perceiv'd by Sense. Now for an Idea to
Exist in an unperceiving Thing is a manifest Contradiction, for to have an Idea
is all one as to perceive, that therefore wherein Colour, Figure, _&c._
Exist must perceive them; Hence 'tis clear there can be no unthinking Substance
or _Substratum_ of those Ideas.

{#8} But say you, though the Ideas themselves do not Exist without the Mind yet
there may be Things like them whereof they are Copies or Resemblances, which
Things Exist without the Mind, in an unthinking Substance I answer an Idea can
be like nothing but an Idea, a Colour, or Figure, can be like nothing but
another Colour or Figure. If we look but never so little into our Thoughts, we
shall find it impossible for us to conceive a Likeness except only between our
Ideas. Again, I ask whether those suppos'd Originals or External Things, of
which our Ideas are the Pictures or Representations, be themselves Perceivable
or no? If they are, then they are Ideas and we have gain'd our Point; but if you
say they are not, I appeal to any one whether it be Sense, to assert a Colour is
like something which is invisible; Hard or Soft, like something which is
Intangible, and so of the rest.

{#9} Some there are who make a distinction betwixt _Primary_ and _Secondary_
Qualities: By the former, they mean Extension, Figure, Motion, Rest, Solidity or
Impenetrability and Number: By the latter they denote all other Sensible
Qualities as Colours, Sounds, Tastes, _&c._ the Ideas we have of these they
acknowledge not to be the Resemblances, of any thing existing without the Mind
or unperceiv'd, but they will have our Ideas of the Primary Qualities to be
Patterns or Images of things which exist without the Mind, in an unthinking
Substance which they call _Matter_. By Matter, therefore, we are to understand
an Inert, Senseless Substance, in which Extension, Figure, Motion, _&c._ do
actually subsist, But it is evident from what we have already shewn, that
Extension, Figure and Notion are only Ideas existing in the Mind, and that an
Idea can be like nothing but another Idea. and that consequently neither They
nor their Archetypes can Exist in an unperceiving Substance. Hence it is plain,
that the very Notion of what is called _Matter_ or _Corporeal Substance_,
involves a Contradiction in it. Insomuch that I shou'd not think it necessary to
spend more time in exposing it's Absurdity. But because the Tenent of the
Existence of Matter seems to have taken so deep a Root in the Minds of
Philosophers, and draws after it so many ill Consequences, l chuse rather to be
thought Prolix and Tedious, than omit any thing that might conduce to the full
Discovery and Extirpation of that Prejudice.

{#10} They who assert that Figure, Motion, and the rest of the Primary or
Original Qualities do Exist without the Mind, in unthinking Substances, do at
the same time acknowledge that Colours, Sounds, Heat, Cold, _&c._ do not,
which they tell us are Sensations existing in the Mind alone, that depend on and
are occasion'd by the different Size, Texture, Motion, _&c._ of the minute
Particles of Matter. This they take for an undoubted Truth, which they can
demonstrate beyond all Exception. Now if it be certain, that those Original
Qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible Qualities, and not,
even in Thought, capable of being Abstracted from them, it plainly follows that
they Exist only in the Mind. But I desire any one to reflect and try, whether he
can by any Abstraction of Thought, conceive the Extension and Motion of a Body,
without all other sensible Qualities. For my own part, I see evidently that it
is not in my power to frame an Idea of a Body Extended and Moving, but I must
withal give it some Colour or other sensible Quality which is acknowleg'd to
Exist only in the Mind. In short, Extension, Figure, and Motion, abstracted from
all other Qualities, are inconceivable. Where therefore the other sensible
Qualities are, there must these be also, _i. e._ in the Mind and no where else.

{#11} Again, _Great_ and _Small, Swift_ and _Slow_, are allow'd to Exist no
where without the Mind, being intirely relative and changing as the Frame or
Position of the Organs of Sense varies. The Extension therefore which Exists
without the Mind, is neither Great nor Small, the Motion, neither Swift nor
Slow, that is, they are nothing at all. But say you they are Extension in
General, and Motion in General: Thus we see how much the Tenent of extended,
moveable Substances Existing without the Mind depends on that strange Doctrine
of _Abstract Ideas_. And here I can't but remark, how nearly the Vague and
indeterminate Description of Matter or Corporeal Substance which the Modern
Philosophers are run into by their own Principles, resembles that antiquated and
so much ridicul'd Notion of _Materia Prima_, to be met with in _Aristotle_ and
his Followers. Without Extension Solidity cannot be conceiv'd; since therefore
it has been shewn that Extension Exists not in an unthinking Substance, the same
must also be true of Solidity.

{#12} That Number is intirely the Creature of the Mind, even though the other
Qualities be allow'd to Exist without, will be evident to whoever considers,
that the same thing bears a different Denomination of Number, as the Mind views
it with different respects, Thus, the same Extension is One or Three or Thirty
Six, according as the Mind considers it with reference to a Yard, a Foot, or an
Inch. Number is so visibly relative, and dependent on Mens Understanding, that
it is strange to think how any one shou'd give it an absolute Existence without
the Mind. We say one Book, one Page, one Line, _&c._ all these are equally
Unites, though some contain several of the others. And in each Instance 'tis
plain, the Unite relates to some particular Combination of Ideas arbitrarily put
together by the Mind.

{#13} Unity I know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded Idea,
accompanying all other Ideas into the Mind. That I have any such Idea answering
the Word _Vnity_, I do not find, and if I had, methinks, I cou'd not miss
finding it, on the contrary it shou'd be the most familiar to my Understanding
since if is said to accompany all other Ideas, and to be perceiv'd by all the
ways of Sensation and Reflexion. To say no more it is an _abstract Idea_.

{#14} I shall farther add, that after the same manner, as modern Philosophers
prove Colours, Tastes, _&c._ to have no Existence in Matter, or without the
Mind, the same thing may be likewise prov'd of all other sensible Qualities
whatsoever. Thus, for Instance, it is said that Heat and Cold, are Affections
only of the Mind, and not at all Patterns of real Beings, existing in the
Corporeal Substances which excite them, for that the same Body which appears
Cold to one Hand, seems Warm to another. Now why may we not as well argue that
Figure and Extension, are not Patterns or Resemblances of Qualities existing in
Matter, because to the same Eye at different Stations, or Eyes of a different
Texture at the same Station, they appear various, and cannot therefore be the
Images of any thing settled and determinate without the Mind? again, 'Tis prov'd
that Sweetness is not really in the Sapid Thing, because the thing remaining
unalter'd the Sweetness is changed into Bitter, as in case of a Fever or
otherwise vitiated Palate. Is it not as reasonable to say, that Motion is not
without the Mind, since if the Succession of Ideas in the Mind become Swifter,
the Motion, it is acknowledg'd, shall appear Slower without any external
Alteration.

{#15} In short, let any one consider those Arguments, which are thought
manifestly to prove that Colours, Tastes, _&c._ Exist only in the Mind, and
he shall find they may with equal force, be brought to prove the same thing of
Extension, Figure, and Motion. Thô it must be confess'd this method of Arguing
does not so much prove that there is no Extension, Colour, _&c._ in an
outward Object, as that we do not know by Sense which is the true Extension or
Colour of the Object. But the Arguments foregoing plainly shew it to be
impossible that any Colour or Extension at all, or other sensible Quality
whatsoever, shou'd Exist in an unthinking Subject without the Mind, or in truth,
that there shou'd be any such thing as an outward Object.

{#16} But let us examine a little the receiv'd Opinion: It is said Extension is
a mode or accident of Matter, and that Matter is the _Substratum_ that supports
it. Now I desire that you wou'd explain to me what is meant by Matter's
_supporting_ Extension: Say you, I have no Idea of Matter and therefore cannot
explain it. I answer, though you have no positive, yet if you have any meaning
at all, you must at least have a Relative Idea of Matter; though you know not
what it is, yet you must be supposed to know what Relation it bears to
Accidents, and what is meant by its supporting them. 'Tis evident _Support_
cannot here be taken in its usual or literal Sense, as when we say that Pillars
support a Building; in what Sense therefore must it be taken? For my part I am
not able to discover any Sense at all that can be applicable to it.

{#17} If we inquire into what the most accurate Philosophers declare themselves
to mean by _Material Substance_; we shall find them acknowledge, they have no
other meaning annexed to those Sounds, but the Idea of Being in general,
together with the Relative Notion of its supporting Accidents. The general Idea
of Being appeareth to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other,
and as for its supporting Accidents, this, as we have just now observ'd, cannot
be understood in the common Sense of those Words, it must therefore be taken in
some other Sense, but what that is they do not explain. So that when I consider
the two Parts or Branches which make the signification of the Words _Material
Substance_, I am convinced there is no distinct meaning annext to them. But why
shou'd we trouble our selves any farther, in discussing this Material
_Substratum_ or Support of Figure and Motion, _&c._ does it not suppose they
have an Existence without the Mind? And is not this a direct Repugnancy and
altogether Inconceivable?

{#18} But though it were possible that solid, Figur'd moveable Substances may
Exist without the Mind, corresponding to the Ideas we have of Bodies, yet how is
it possible for us to know this? Either we must know it by Sense or by Reason.
As for our Senses, by them we have the Knowledge only of our Sensations, Ideas,
or those things that are immediately perceiv'd by Sense, call 'em what you will:
But they do not inform us that things Exist without the Mind, or unperceiv'd,
like to those which are perceiv'd. This the Materialists themselves acknowledge.
It remains therefore that if we have any Knowledge at all of External Things, it
must be by Reason, inferring their Existence from what is immediately perceiv'd
by Sense. But I do not see what reason can induce us to believe the Existence of
Bodies without the Mind, from what we perceive, since the very Patrons of Matter
themselves do not pretend, there is any necessary Connexion betwixt them and our
Ideas. I say it is granted on all Hands (and what happens in Dreams, Frenzys and
the like puts it beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be affected with
all the Ideas we have now, though there were no Bodies Existing without
resembling them. Hence it is evident the Supposition of External Bodies is not
necessary for the producing our Ideas: Since it is granted they are produced
sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same Order, we see them
in at present, without their Concurrence.

{#19} But, though we might possibly have all our Sensations without them, yet
perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their
Production, by supposing External Bodies in their likeness rather than
otherwise, and so it might be at least probable there are such things as Bodies
that excite their Ideas in our Minds. But neither can this be said, for though
we give the Materialists their External Bodies, they by their one confession are
never the nearer knowing how our Ideas are produced: Since they own themselves
unable to comprehend in what manner Body can act upon Spirit, or how it is
possible it shou'd imprint any Idea in the Mind. Hence it is evident the
Production of Ideas or Sensations in our Minds, can be no reason why we shou'd
suppose Matter or Corporeal Substances, since that is acknowleg'd to remain
equally inexplicable with, or without this Supposition. If therefore it were
possible for Bodies to Exist without the Mind, yet to hold they do so, must
needs be a very precarious Opinion; since it is to suppose, without any reason
at all, that God has Created innumerable Beings that are intirely useless, and
serve to no manner of purpose.

{#20} In short, though there were External Bodies, 'tis impossible we shou'd
ever come to know it; and if there were not, we shou'd have the very same
Reasons to think there were that we have now. Suppose, what no one can deny
possible, an Intelligence to be affected with the same train of Sensations or
Ideas that you are, imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his
Mind. I ask whether that Intelligence hath not all the Reason to believe the
Existence of Corporeal Substances, represented by his Ideas, and exciting them
in his Mind, that you can possibly have for believing the same thing? Of this
there can be no Question, which one Consideration were enough to make any
reasonable Person, suspect the strength of whatever Arguments he may think
himself to have, for the Existence of Bodies without the Mind.

{#21} Where it necessary to add any farther Proof against the Existence of
Matter, after what has been said, I cou'd instance several of those Errours and
Difficulties (not to mention Impieties) which have sprung from that Tenent. It
has occasion'd numberless Controversies and Disputes in Philosophy, and not a
few of far greater moment in Religion. But I shall not enter into the detail of
them in this Place, as well because I think, Arguments _a~posteriori_ are
unnecessary for confirming what has been, if I mistake not, sufficiently
demonstrated _a~Priori_, as because I shall hereafter find occasion to speak
somewhat of them.

{#22} I am affraid I have given cause to think, I am needlesly Prolix in
handling this Subject. For to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be
demonstrated with the utmost Evidence in a Line or Two, to any one that's
capable of the least Reflexion? It is but looking into your own Thoughts, and so
trying whether you can conceive it possible for a Sound, or Figure, or Motion,
or Colour to Exist without the Mind, or Unperceiv'd. This easy Tryal may perhaps
make you see, that what you contend for, is a downright Contradiction. Insomuch
that I am content to put the whole upon this Issue; if you can but conceive it
possible for one Extended, moveable Substance, or in general, for any one Idea
or any thing like an Idea to Exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving it, I
shall readily give up the Cause: And as for all that _compages_ of External
Bodies you contend for, I shall grant you its Existence, though you cannot
either give me any Reason why you believe it Exists, or assign any use to it
when it is supposed to Exist. I say, the bare possibility of your Opinions being
true, shall pass for an Argument that it is so.

{#23} But say you, surely there's nothing easier than for me to imagine Trees,
for Instance, in a Park, or Books Existing in a Closet, and no Body by to
perceive them. I answer you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is
all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you
call _Books_ and _Trees_, and at the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any
one that may perceive them? But do not you your self Perceive or Think of them
all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: It only shews you have
the power of Imagining or Forming Ideas in your Mind; but it does not shew that
you can conceive it possible, the Objects of your Thought may Exist without the
Mind; to make out this, it is necessary that you conceive them Existing
unconceiv'd or unthought of, which is a manifest Repugnancy. When we do our
utmost to conceive the Existence of External Bodies, we are all the while only
Contemplating our own Ideas. But the Mind taking no notice of it self, is
deluded to think it can and does conceive Bodies Existing unthought of or
without the Mind; though at the same time they are apprehended by or Exist in it
self. A little Attention will discover to any one the Truth and Evidence of what
is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on any other Proofs against the
Existence of Material Substance.

{#24} Cou'd Men but forbear to amuse themselves with Words, we shou'd I believe,
soon come to an Agreement in this Point. It is very obvious upon the least
inquiry into our own Thoughts, to know whether it be possible for us to
understand what is meant, by the _absolute Existence of sensible Objects in
themselves, or without the Mind_. To me 'tis evident those Words mark out either
a direct Contradiction, or else nothing at all. And to convince others of this,
I know no readier or fairer way, than to intreat they wou'd calmly attend to
their own Thoughts: And if by this Attention, the Emptiness or Repugnancy of
those Expressions does appear, surely nothing more is requisite for their
Conviction. 'Tis on this therefore that I insist, _viz._ that the absolute
Existence of unthinking Things are Words without a Meaning, or which include a
Contradiction. This is what I repeat and inculcate, and earnestly recommend to
the attentive Thoughts of the Reader.

{#25} All our Ideas, Sensations, Notions or the things which we perceive by
whatsoever Names they may be distinguish'd, are visibly Inactive, there is
nothing of Power or Agency included in them. So that one Idea or Object of
Thought cannot Produce, or make any Alteration in another. To be satisfied of
the Truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare Observation of our
Ideas. For since they and every part of them Exist only in the Mind, it follows
that there is nothing in them but what is Perceiv'd: But whoever shall attend to
his Ideas, whether of Sense or Reflexion, will not perceive in them any Power or
Activity, there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little
Attention will discover to us that the very Being of an Idea implies Passiveness
and Inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an Idea to do any thing,
or, strictly speaking, to be the Cause of any thing: Neither can it be the
Resemblance or Pattern of any active Being, as is evident from _Sect._ VIII.
Whence it plainly follows that Extension, Figure and Motion, cannot be the Cause
of our Sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of Powers
resulting from the Configuration, Number, Motion, Size, _&c._ of Corpuscles
must certainly be false.

{#26} We perceive a continual Succession of Ideas, some are anew Excited, others
are Changed or totally Disappear. There is therefore some Cause of these Ideas
whereon they depend, and which produces and changes them. That this Cause cannot
be any Quality or Idea or Combination of Ideas, is clear from the preceding
Section. It must therefore be a Substance, but it has been shewn that there is
no Corporeal or Material Substance: It remains therefore that the Cause of Ideas
is an Incorporeal, active Substance or Spirit.

{#27} A Spirit is one Simple, Undivided, active Being, as it perceives Ideas, it
is called the _Understanding_, and as it produces or otherwise operates about
them, it is called the _Will_. Hence there can be no Idea formed of a Soul or
Spirit: For all Ideas whatever, being Passive and Inert, _vid. Sect._ XXV, they
cannot represent unto us, by way of Image or Likeness, that which Acts. A little
Attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an Idea which shall be
like that active Principle of Motion and Change of Ideas, is absolutely
impossible. Such is the Nature of _Spirit_ or that which Acts, that it cannot be
of it self Perceived, but only by the Effects which it produceth. If any Man
shall doubt of the Truth of what is here delivered, let him but reflect and try
if he can frame the Idea of any Power or active Being; and whether he has Ideas
of two Principal Powers, mark'd by the Names _Will_ and _Understanding_,
distinct from each other as well as from a third Idea of Substance or Being in
general, with a relative Notion of its supporting or being the Subject of the
aforesaid Powers, which is signified by the Name _Soul_ or _Spirit_. This is
what some hold; but so far as I can see, the Words _Will, Understanding, Mind,
Soul, Spirit_, do not stand for different Ideas, or in truth, for any Idea at
all, but for Something which is very different from Ideas, and which being an
Agent cannot be like unto, or represented by, any Idea whatsoever.

{#28} I find I can Excite Ideas in my Mind at pleasure, and vary and shift the
Scene as oft as I think fit. 'Tis no more than Willing, and straightway this or
that Idea arises in my Fancy: And by the same Power it is obliterated, and makes
way for another. This making and unmaking of Ideas doth very properly denominate
the Mind Active. Thus much is certain, and grounded on Experience: But when we
talk of unthinking Agents, or of exciting Ideas exclusive of Volition, we only
amuse our selves with Words.

{#29} But whatever Power I may have over my own Thoughts, I find the Ideas
actually perceiv'd by Sense have not a like Dependence on my Will. When in broad
Day-light I open my Eyes, 'tis not in my Power to chuse whether I shall See or
no, or to determine what particular Objects shall present themselves to my View;
And so likewise as to the Hearing and other Senses, the Ideas imprinted on them
are not Creatures of my Will. There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that
produces them.

{#30} The Ideas of Sense are more strong, lively and distinct than those of the
Imagination, they have likewise a Steddiness, Order and Coherence, and are not
excited at Random, as those which are the effects of Human Wills often are, but
in a regular Train or Series, the admirable Connexion whereof sufficiently
testifies the Wisdom and Benevolence of its Author. Now the set Rules or
establish'd Methods, wherein the Mind we depend on excites in us the Ideas of
Sense, are called the _Laws of Nature_: And these we learn by Experience, which
teaches us that such and such Ideas are attended with such and such other Ideas,
in the ordinary course of Things.

{#31} This gives us a sort of Foresight, which enables us to regulate our
Actions for the benefit of Life. And without this we shou'd be eternally at a
loss, we cou'd not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least
Pleasure, or remove the least Pain of Sense. That Food Nourishes, Sleep
Refreshes, and Fire Warms us; that to Sow in the Seed-time is the way to Reap in
the Harvest, and, in general, that to obtain such or such Ends, such or such
Means are conducive, all this we know, not by discovering any necessary
Connexion between our Ideas, but only by the Observation of the settled Laws of
Nature, without which we shou'd be all in Uncertainty and Confusion, and a grown
Man no more know how to manage himself in the Affairs of Life, than an Infant
just Born.

{#32} And yet this consistent, uniform Working which so evidently displays the
Goodness and Wisdom of that Governing Spirit whose Will constitutes the Laws of
Nature, is so far from leading our Thoughts to Him, that it rather sends 'em a
wandering after second Causes. For when we perceive certain Ideas of Sense
constantly follow'd by other Ideas, and we know this is not of our own doing, we
forthwith attribute Power and Agency to the Ideas themselves, and make one the
Cause of another, than which nothing can be more Absurd and Unintelligible.
Thus, for Example, having observ'd that when we perceive by Sight a certain
round, luminous Figure, we at the same time perceive by Touch the Idea or
Sensation called _Heat_, we do from thence conclude the Sun to be the cause of
Heat. And in like manner perceiving the Motion and Collision of Bodies to be
attended with Sound, we are inclined to think the latter the effect of the
former.

{#33} The ideas imprinted on the Senses by the Author of Nature are called _real
things_, and those excited in the Imagination being less Regular, Vivid and
Constant, are more properly termed _Ideas_, or _Images of Things_, which they
copy and represent. But then our Sensations, be they never so Vivid and
Distinct, are nevertheless _Ideas, i. e._ they Exist in the Mind, or are
perceived by it, as truly as the Ideas of its own framing. The Ideas of Sense
are allow'd to have more reality in them, _i. e._ to be more Strong, Orderly and
Coherent than the Creatures of the Mind; but this is no Argument that they Exist
without the Mind. They are also less dependent on the Spirit, or thinking
Substance which perceives them, in that they are excited by the Will of another
and more Powerful Spirit: yet still they are _Ideas_, and certainly no _Idea_,
whether Faint or Strong, can Exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving it.

{#34} Before we proceed any farther, it is necessary we spend some Time in
Answering Objections which may probably be made against the Principles we have
hitherto laid down. In doing of which, if I seem too Prolix to those of quick
Apprehensions, I desire I may be excused, since all Men do not equally apprehend
things of this Nature; and I am willing to be understood by every one. First,
then, it will be objected that by the foregoing Principles, all that is real and
substantial in Nature is banish'd out of the World: And instead thereof a
Chimerical Scheme of Ideas takes place. All things that Exist, Exist only in the
Mind, that is, they are purely Notional. What therefore becomes of the Sun, Moon
and Stars? What must we think of Houses, Rivers, Mountains, Trees, Stones; nay,
even of our own Bodies? Are all these but so many Chimeras and Illusions on the
Fancy? To all which, and whatever else of the same sort may be objected, I
Answer, that by the Principles premis'd, we are not deprived of any one thing in
Nature. Whatever we See, Feel, Hear, or any wise Conceive or Understand, remains
as secure as ever, and is as real as ever. There is a _rerum natura_, and the
Distinction between Realities and Chimeras retains its full force. This is
evident from _Sect._ XXIX, XXX, and XXXIII, where we have shewn what is meant by
_real Things_ in opposition to _Chimeras_, or Ideas of our own framing; but then
they both equally Exist in the Mind, and in that Sense are alike _Ideas_.

{#35} I do not Argue against the Existence of any one thing that we can
apprehend, either by Sense or Reflexion, That the things I see with my Eyes and
touch with my Hands do Exist, really Exist, I make not the least Question, The
only thing whose Existence we deny, is that which Philosophers call Matter or
Corporeal Substance. And in doing of this, there is no Damage done to the rest
of Mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it. The Atheist, indeed, will want
the Colour of an empty Name to support his Impiety; and the Philosophers may
possibly find, they have lost a great Handle for Trifling and Disputation. But
that's all the Harm that I can see done.

{#36} If any Man thinks we detract from the Existence or Reality of things, he
is very far from Understanding what has been premis'd in the plainest Terms I
cou'd think of. Take here an Abstract of what has been said. There are Spiritual
Substances, Minds or Human Souls which will or excite Ideas in themselves at
pleasure: but these are faint, weak, and unsteady in respect of others they
perceive by Sense, which being impress'd upon them according to certain Rules or
Laws of Nature, speak themselves the effects of a Mind more powerful and wise
than Human Spirits. These latter are said to have more _Reality_ in them than
the former: By which is meant that they are more affecting, orderly and
distinct, and that they are not Fictions of the Mind perceiving them. And in
this Sense, the Sun that I see by Day is the real Sun, and that which I imagine
by Night is the Idea of the former. In the Sense here given of _Reality_, 'tis
evident that every Vegetable, Star, Mineral, and in general each part of the
Mundane System, is as much a _Real Being_ by our Principles as by any other.
Whether others mean any thing by the Term _Reality_ different from what I do, I
intreat them to look into their own thoughts and see.

{#37} It will be urg'd that thus much at least is true, _viz._ that we take away
all Corporeal Substances. To this my Answer is, That if the word _Substance_ be
taken in the vulgar Sense, for a Combination of Sensible Qualities, such as
Extension, Solidity, Weight, _&c._ This we cannot be accused of taking away.
But if it be taken in a Phylosophic Sense, for the support of Accidents or
Qualities without the Mind: then, indeed, I acknowledge that we take it away, if
one may be said to take away that which never had any Existence, not even in the
Imagination.

{#38} But after all, say you, it sounds very harsh to say we Eat and Drink
Ideas, and are Cloathed with Ideas. I acknowledge it does so, the word _Idea_
not being used in common Discourse to signifie the several Combinations of
sensible Qualities, which are called _Things:_ and it is certain that any
Expression which varies from the familiar Use of Language will seem harsh and
ridiculous. But this does not concern the Truth of the Proposition, which in
other Words is no more than this, _viz._ we are Fed and Cloathed with those
Things which we perceive immediately by our Senses. The Hardness or Softness,
the Colour, Taste, Warmth, Figure, _&c._ which combin'd together constitute
the several sorts of Victuals and Apparel, have been shewn to Exist only in the
Mind that perceives them; and this is all that's meant by calling 'em _Ideas_,
which Word if it was as ordinarily used as _Thing_, wou'd sound no Harsher nor
more Ridiculous than it. I am not for disputing about the Propriety, but the
Truth of the Expression. If therefore you agree with me that we Eat, and Drink,
and are Clad with the immediate Objects of Sense which cannot Exist unperceiv'd
or without the Mind: I shall readily grant it is more proper or conformable to
Custom, that they shou'd be called Things rather than Ideas.

{#39} If it be demanded why I make use of the word Idea, and do not rather in
compliance with Custom call them Things. I answer, I do it for two Reasons:
First, because the Term _Thing_, in contradistinction to _Idea_, is generally
supposed to denote somewhat Existing, without the Mind; Secondly, because
_Thing_ hath a more comprehensive Signification than _Idea_, including Spirits
or thinking Things as well as Ideas. Since therefore the Objects of Sense Exist
only in the Mind, and are withal thoughtless and inactive, I chose to mark them
by the word _Idea_ which implies those Properties.

{#40} But say what we can, some one perhaps may be apt to Reply, he will still
believe his Senses, and never suffer any Arguments, how plausible soever, to
prevail over the Certainty of them. Be it so, assert the Evidence of Sense as
high as you please, we are willing to do the same. That what I See, Hear and
Feel doth Exist, _i. e._ is perceived by me, I no more doubt than I do of my own
Being. But I do not see how the Testimony of Sense can be alleg'd, as a proof
for the Existence of any Thing, which is not perceiv'd by Sense. We are not for
having any Man turn _Sceptic_, and disbelieve his Senses; on the contrary we
give them all the Stress and Assurance imaginable; nor are there any Principles
more opposite to Scepticisim, than those we have laid down, as shall be
hereafter clearly shewn.

{#41} Secondly, It will be objected that there is a great difference betwixt
real Fire, for Instance, and the Idea of Fire, betwixt dreaming or imagining
ones self Burnt, and actually being so: If you suspect it to be only the Idea of
Fire which you see, do but put your Hand into it, and you'll be convinced with a
witness. This and the like may be urged in opposition to our Tenents. To all
which the Answer is evident from what hath been already said, and I shall only
add in this place, that if real Fire be very different from the Idea of Fire, so
also is the real Pain that it occasions, very different from the Idea of the
same Pain, and yet no Body will pretend that real Pain either is, or can
possibly be, in an unperceiving Thing or without the Mind, any more than its
Idea.

{#42} Thirdly, It will be objected that we see things actually without or at a
distance from us, and which consequently do not Exist in the Mind, it being
absurd that those Things, which are seen at the Distance of several Miles,
shou'd be as near to us as our own Thoughts. In answer to this, I desire it may
be consider'd that in a Dream we do oft perceive Things, as Existing at a great
distance off, and yet for all that, those Things are acknowleg'd to have their
Existence only in the Mind.

{#43} But for the fuller clearing of this Point, it may be worth while to
consider, how it is that we perceive Distance and Things placed at a Distance by
Sight. For that we shou'd in truth see External Space, and Bodies actually
Existing in it, some nearer, others farther off, seems to carry with it some
Opposition to what hath been said, of their Existing no where without the Mind.
The Consideration of this Difficulty it was, that gave birth to my _Essay
towards a new Theory of Vision_, which was publish'd not long since. Wherein it
is shewn that _Distance_ or Outness is neither immediately of it self perceived
by Sight, nor yet apprehended or judged of by Lines and Angles, or any thing
that hath a necessary Connexion with it: But that it is only suggested to our
Thoughts, by certain visible Ideas and Sensations attending Vision, which in
their own Nature have no manner of Similitude or Relation, either with Distance,
or Things placed at a Distance. But by a Connexion taught us by Experience, they
came to signify and Suggest them to us, after the same manner that Words of any
Language Suggest the Ideas they are made to stand for. Insomuch that a Man Born
Blind, and afterwards made to see, wou'd not, at first Sight, think the things
he saw to be without his Mind, or at any Distance from him. _vid. Sect._ XLI. of
the forementioned Treatise.

{#44} The Ideas of Sight and Touch make two Species, intirely distinct and
heterogeneous. The former are Marks and Prognostics of the latter. That the
proper Objects of Sight neither Exist without the Mind, nor are the Images of
External Things, was shewn even in that Treatise. Thô throughout the same, the
contrary be supposed true of Tangible Objects: Not that to suppose that Vulgar
Error, was necessary for establishing the Notion therein laid down, but because
it was beside my Purpose to Examine and Refute it in a Discourse concerning
_Vision_. So that in strict Truth the Ideas of Sight, when we apprehend by them
Distance and Things placed at a Distance, do not Suggest or mark out to us
Things actually Existing at a Distance, but only admonish us what Ideas of Touch
will be imprinted in our Minds at such and such distances of Time, and in
consequence of such or such Actions. It is, I say, evident from what has been
said in the foregoing Parts of this Treatise, and in _Sect._ CXLVII and
elsewhere of the Essay concerning Vision, that Visible Ideas are the Language
whereby the governing Spirit, on whom we depend, informs us what Tangible Ideas
he is about to imprint upon us, in case we Excite this or that Motion in our own
Bodies. But for a fuller Information in this Point, I refer to the Essay it
self.

{#45} Fourthly, It will be objected that from the foregoing Principles it
follows, Things are every moment annihilated and created anew. The Objects of
Sense Exist only when they are Perceived: The Trees therefore are in the Garden,
or the Chairs in the Parlour, no longer than while there is some Body by to
perceive them. Upon shutting my Eyes all the Furniture in the Room is reduc'd to
nothing, and barely upon opening 'em it is again created. In answer to all
which, I refer the Reader to what has been said in _Sect._ III, IV, _&c._
and desire he will consider whether he means any thing, by the actual Existence
of an Idea, distinct from its being perceiv'd. For my part after the nicest
Inquiry I cou'd make, I am not able to discover that any thing else is meant by
those Words. And I once more intreat the Reader to sound his own Thoughts, and
not suffer himself to be imposed on by Words. If he can conceive it possible
either for his Ideas or their Archetypes to Exist without being perceived, then
I give up the Cause: But if he cannot, he will acknowledge it is unreasonable
for him to stand up in Defence of he knows not what, and pretend to charge on me
as an Absurdity, the not assenting to those Propositions which at Bottom have no
meaning in them.

{#46} It will not be amiss to observe, how far the receiv'd Principles of
Philosophy are themselves chargeable with those pretended Absurdities. It is
thought strangely Absurd that upon closing my Eye-lids, all the Visible Objects
round me shou'd be reduced to nothing; and yet is not this what Philosophers
commonly acknowledge, when they agree on all Hands that Light and Colours, which
alone are the proper and immediate Objects of Sight, are meer Sensations that
Exist no longer than they are perceiv'd? Again it may to some perhaps seem very
incredible, that things shou'd be every moment creating, yet this very Notion is
commonly taught in the Schools. For the _Schoolmen_, though they acknowledge the
Existence of Matter and that the whole mundane Fabrick is framed out of it, are
nevertheless of Opinion that it cannot subsist without the Divine Conservation,
which by them is expounded to be a continual Creation.

{#47} Farther, a little Thought will discover to us, that though we allow the
Existence of Matter or Corporeal Substance, yet it will unavoidably follow from
the principles which are now generally admitted, that the Particular Bodies of
what kind soever do none of them Exist whilst they are not perceived. For it is
evident from _Sect._ XI, _&c._ that the Matter Philosophers contend for is
an incomprehensible Somewhat which hath none of those particular Qualities,
whereby the Bodies falling under our Senses are distinguished one from another.
But to make this more plain, it must be remarked that the Infinite Divisibility
of Matter is now universally allow'd, at least by the most approv'd and
considerable Philosophers, who on the receiv'd Principles demonstrate it beyond
all exception. Hence it follows, there is an infinite number of Parts in each
Particle of Matter, which are not perceiv'd by Sense. The reason, therefore,
that any particular Body seems to be of a finite Magnitude, or exhibits only a
finite number of Parts to Sense, is, not because it contains no more, since in
it self it contains an infinite number of Parts, but because the Sense is not
acute enough to discern them. In proportion therefore as the Sense is render'd
more acute, it perceives a greater num-of Parts in the Object _i.e._ the Object
appears greater, and its Figure varies, those Parts in its Extremities which
were before unperceivable, appearing now to bound it in very different Lines and
Angles from those perceived by an obtuser Sense. And at length, after various
changes of Size and Shape, when the Sense becomes infinitely acute, the Body
shall seem infinite. During all which there is no alteration in the Body, but
only in the Sense. Each Body, therefore, consider'd in it self is infinitely
extended, and consequently void of all Shape or Figure. From which it follows
that though we shou'd grant the Existence of Matter to be never so certain, yet
it is withal as certain, the Materialists themselves are by their own Principles
forced to acknowledge, that neither the particular Bodies perceived by Sense,
nor any thing like them Exists without the Mind. Matter, I say, and each
Particle thereof is according to them Infinite and Shapeless, and it is the Mind
that frames all that variety of Bodies which compose the visible World, any one
whereof does not Exist longer than it is perceiv'd.

{#48} But after all, if we consider it, the Objection proposed in _Sect._ XLV;
will not be found reasonably charg'd on the Principles we have premised, so as
in truth to make any Ojection at all against our Notions. For though we hold
indeed the Objects of Sense to be nothing else but Ideas which cannot Exist
unperceiv'd: yet we may not hence conclude they have no Existence except only
while they are perceiv'd by us, since there may be some other Spirit that
perceives them though we do not. Wherever Bodies are said to have no Existence
without the Mind, I wou'd not be understood to mean this or that particular
Mind, but all Minds whatsoever. It does not therefore follow from the foregoing
Principles, that Bodies are annihilated and created every moment, or Exist not
at all during the Intervals between our perception of them.

{#49} Fifthly, it may perhaps be objected, that if Extension and Figure exist
only in the Mind, it follows that the Mind is extended and figured; since
Extension is a Mode or Attribute which (to speak with the Schools) is predicated
of the Subject in which it Exists. answer, Those qualities are in the Mind only
as they are perceiv'd by it, that not by way of _Mode_ or _Attribute_ but only
by way of _Idea_, and it no more follows the Soul or Mind is extended because
Extension Exists in it alone, than it does that it is Red or Blue because those
Colours are on all Hands acknowleg'd to Exist in it, and no where else. As to
what Philosophers say of Subject and Mode, that seems very groundless and
unintelligible. For instance, in this Proposition, a Die is Hard, Extended and
Square, they will have it that the word _Die_ denotes a Subject or Substance,
distinct from the Hardness, Extension, and Figure which are predicated of it,
and in which they Exist. This I can't comprehend: To me a Die seems to be
nothing distinct from those things which are termed its Modes or Accidents. And
to say a Die is Hard, Extended and Square, is not to attribute those Qualities
to a subject distinct from and supporting them, but only an Explication of the
meaning of the word _Die_.

{#50} Sixthly, you'll say there have been a great many things explain'd by
Matter and Motion, take away these and you destroy the whole Corpuscular
Philosophy, and undermine those Mechanical Principles which have been applied
with so much success to account for the _Phaenomena_. In short, whatever
Advances have been made, either by Ancient or Modern Philosophers, in the Study
of Nature do all proceed on the Supposition, that Corporeal Substance or Matter
doth really Exist. To this, I answer, that there is not any one _Phaenomenon_
explain'd on that Supposition, which may not as well be explain'd without it, as
might easily be made appear by an induction of Particulars. To Explain the
_Phenomena_, is all one as to shew why upon such and such Occasions, we are
affected with such and such Ideas. But how Matter shou'd Operate on a Spirit, or
produce any Idea in it, is what no Philosopher will pretend to explain. It is
therefore evident, there can be no use of Matter in Natural Philosophy. Besides,
they who attempt to account for Things, do it, not by Corporeal Substance but,
by Figure, Motion, _&c._ which are in truth no more than meer Ideas, and
therefore cannot be the cause of any thing, as hath been already shewn _vid.
Sect._ XXV.

{#51} Seventhly, it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem absurd,
to take away Natural Causes, and ascribe every thing to the immediate Operation
of Spirits? We must no longer say upon these Principles that Fire Heats, or
Water Cools, but that a Spirit Heats, _&c._ wou'd not a Man be deservedly
laught at, who shou'd talk after this manner? I answer he wou'd so, in such
Things we ought to _Think with the Learned, and Speak with the Vulgar_. They who
to demonstration are convinced of the truth of the Copernican System, do
nevertheless say the Sun Rises, the Sun Sets or comes to the Meridian: And if
they affected a contrary Stile, in common talk, it wou'd without doubt appear
very ridiculous. A little Reflexion on what is here said will make it manifest,
that the common use of Language wou'd receive no manner of Alteration or
Disturbance from the admission of our Tenents.

{#52} In the ordinary affairs of Life, any Phrases may be retain'd, so long as
they Excite in us proper Sentiments, or Dispositions to act in such a manner as
is necessary for our well-being, how false soever they may be, if taken in a
strict and Speculative Sense. Nay this is unavoidable since, Propriety being
regulated by Custom, Language is suited to the received Opinions which are not
always the truest. Hence it is impossible even in the most rigid, Philosophic
Reasonings, so far to alter the Bent and Genius of the Tongue we speak, as never
to give a handle for Cavillers to pretend Difficulties and Inconsistencies. But
a fair and ingenuous Reader will collect the Sense, from the Scope and Tenor and
Connexion of a Discourse, making allowances for those unaccurate Modes of
Speech, which use has made inevitable.

{#53} As to the Opinion that there are no Corporeal Causes, this has been
heretofore maintain'd by some of the Schoolmen, as it is of late by others among
the Modern Philosophers, who though they allow Matter to Exist, yet will have
GOD alone to be the immediate efficient Cause of all Things. These Men saw, that
amongst all the Objects of Sense there was none, which had any Power or Activity
included in it, and that by consequence this was likewise true, of whatever
Bodies they supposed to Exist without the Mind, like unto the immediate Objects
of Sense. But then, that they shou'd suppose an innumerable multitude of Created
Beings, which they acknowledge are not capable of producing any one effect in
Nature, and which therefore are made to no manner of purpose, since God might
have done every thing as well without them, this I say though we shou'd allow it
possible, must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant Supposition.

{#54} In the Eighth Place, the universal concurrent assent of Mankind may be
thought by some, an invincible Argument in behalf of Matter, or the Existence of
External Things. Must we suppose the whole World to be mistaken, and if so, what
cause can be assign'd of so wide-spread and predominant an Error? I answer,
First, that upon a narrow inquiry, it will not perhaps be found, so many as is
imagin'd do really believe the Existence of Matter, or Things without the Mind.
Strictly speaking, to believe that which involves a Contradiction, or has no
meaning in it, is impossible, and whether the foregoing Expressions are not of
that sort, I refer it to the impartial Examination of the Reader. In one Sense,
indeed, Men may be said to believe that Matter Exists, _i. e._ they act as if
the immediate Cause of their Sensations, which affects them every moment, and is
so nearly present to them, were some senseless unthinking Being. But that they
shou'd clearly apprehend any meaning marked by those Words, and form thereof a
Settled Speculative Opinion, is what I am not able to conceive. This is not the
only Instance wherein Men impose upon themselves, by Imagining they believe
those Propositions they have often heard, though at Bottom they have no meaning
in them.

{#55} But Secondly, Thô we shou'd grant a Notion to be never so universally and
stedfastly adhered to, yet this is but a weak Argument of its truth, to whoever
considers what a vast number of Prejudices and false Opinions are every where
embraced, with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting (which are the
far-greater) part of Mankind. There was a time when the _Antipodes_ and Motion
of the Earth, were look'd upon as monstrous Absurdities, even by Men of
Learning: And if it be consider'd what a small proportion they bear to the rest
of Mankind, we shall find that at this Day, those Notions have gain'd but a very
inconsiderable footing in the World.

{#56} But it is demanded, that we assign a cause of this Prejudice, and account
for its obtaining in the World. To this I answer, That Men knowing they
perceiv'd several Ideas, whereof they themselves were not the Authors, as not
being excited from within, nor depending on the operation of their Wills, this
made 'em maintain, those Ideas or Objects of Perception had an Existence
independent of, and without the Mind, without ever dreaming that a Contradiction
was involved in those Words. But Philosphers having plainly seen, that the
immediate Objects of Perception do not Exist without the Mind, they in some
degree corrected the mistake of the Vulgar, but at the same time run into
another which seems no less Absurd, _viz._ that there are certain Objects really
Existing without the Mind, or having a subsistence distinct from being
perceived, of which our Ideas are only Images or Resemblance, imprinted by those
Objects on the Mind. And this Notion of the Philosophers ows its Origine to the
same cause with the former, namely their being conscious that they were not the
Authors of their own Sensations, which they evidently knew were imprinted from
without, and which therefore must have some cause, distinct from the Minds on
which they are imprinted.

{#57} But why they shou'd suppose the Ideas of Sense to be excited in us, by
things in their likeness, and not rather have recourse to _Spirit_ which alone
can act, may be accounted for, First, because they were not aware of the
Repugnancy there is, as well in supposing things like unto our Ideas Existing
without, as in attributing to them Power or Activity. Secondly, because the
supreme Spirit which Excites those Ideas in our Minds, is not mark'd out and
limited to our view by any particular, finite Collection of sensible Ideas, as
Human Agents are by their Size, Complexion, Limbs, Motions, _&c._ And
Thirdly, because his Operations are regular and uniform. Whenever the Course of
Nature is interrupted by a Miracle, Men are ready to own the presence of a
Superiour Agent. But when we see things go on in the ordinary Course, they do
not Excite in us any Reflexion, their Order and Concatenation, though it be an
Argument of the greatest Wisdom, Power, and Goodness in their Creator, is yet so
constant and familiar to us, that we do not think 'em the immediate effects of a
_Free Spirit_: especially since Inconstancy and Mutability in acting, though it
be an Imperfection, is look'd on as a mark of _Freedom_.

{#58} \S 58 Tenthly, It will be objected, that the Notions we advance are
inconsistent with several sound Truths in Philosophy and Mathematics. For
Example, The Motion of the Earth is now universally admitted by Astronomers, as
a Truth grounded on the clearest and most convincing Reasons. But on the
foregoing Principles there can be no such thing. For Motion being only an Idea,
it follows that if it be not perceived it Exists not, but the Motion of the
Earth is not perceiv'd by Sense. I Answer, That Tenent, if rightly understood,
will be found to agree with the Principles we have premised: For the Question,
whether the Earth moves or no, amounts in reality to no more than this, _viz._
whether we have reason to conclude, from what hath been observ'd by Astronomers,
that if we were placed in such and such Circumstances, and such or such a
Position and Distance, both from the Earth and Sun, we shou'd perceive the
former to move among the Choir of the Planets, and appearing in all respects
like one of them: And this, by the Establish'd Rules of Nature, which we have no
reason to mistrust, is reasonably collected from the Phaenomena.

{#59} We may from the Experience we have had, of the Train and Succession of
Ideas in our Minds, often make, I will not say uncertain Conjectures, but, sure
and well grounded Predictions, concerning the Ideas we shall be affected with
pursuant to a great Train of Actions, and be enabled to pass a right Judgement
of what wou'd have appear'd to us, in case we were placed in Circumstances, very
different from those we are in at present. Herein consists the Knowledge of
Nature, which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what
hath been said. It will be easy, to apply this to whatever Objections of the
like sort may be drawn, from the Magnitude of the Stars, or any other
Discoveries in Astronomy or Nature.

{#60} In the eleventh Place, it will be demanded to what purpose serves that
curious Organization of Plants, and the admirable Mechanism in the Parts of
Animals; might not Vegetables grow, and shoot forth Leaves and Blossoms, and
Animals perform all their Motions, as well without, as with all that variety of
Internal Parts so elegantly contriv'd and put together, which being Ideas, have
nothing Powerful or Operative in them, nor have any necessary connexion with the
effects ascribed to them? If it be a Spirit that immediately produces every
effect by a _fiat_, or act of his will, we must think all that's fine and
artificial in the Works, whether of Man or Nature, to be made in vain. By this
Doctrine, though an Artist has made the Spring and Wheels, and every Movement of
a Watch, and adjusted them in such a manner, as he knew wou'd produce the
Motions he design'd; yet he must think all this done to no purpose, and that it
is an Intelligence which directs the Index, and points to the Hour of the Day.
If so, why may not the Intelligence do it, without his being at the pains of
making the Movements, and putting them together? Why does not an empty Case
serve as well as another; and how comes it to pass, that whenever there is any
Fault in the going of a Watch, there is some corresponding Disorder to be found
in the Movements, which being mended by a skilful Hand, all is right again? The
like may be said of all the Clock-work of Nature, great part whereof is so
wonderfully Fine and Subtile, as scarce to be discern'd by the best Microscope.
In short it will be ask'd, how upon our Principles any tolerable Account can be
given, or any final Cause assign'd of an innumerable multitude of Bodies and
Machines, fram'd with the most exquisite Art, which in the common Philosophy
have very apposite Uses assigned them, and serve to explain abundance of
Phaenomena.

{#61} To all which, I answer, First, That though there were some Difficulties
relating to the administration of Providence, and the Uses by it assign'd to the
several parts of Nature, which I cou'd not solve by the foregoing Principles,
yet this Objection cou'd be of small weight against the truth and certainty of
those Things, which may be prov'd _a~Priori_, with the utmost Evidence and Rigor
of Demonstration. Secondly, But neither are the receiv'd Principles free from
the like Difficulties; for it may still be demanded, to what end God shou'd take
those round-about Methods of effecting things by Instruments and Machines, which
no one can deny might have been effected by the meer command of his Will,
without all that _apparatus:_ Nay, if we narrowly consider it, we shall find the
Objection may be retorted with greater force, on those who hold the Existence of
those Machines without the Mind; for it has been made evident, that Solidity,
Bulk, Figure, Motion, _&c._ have no _Activity_ or _Efficacy_ in them, so as
to be capable of producing any one effect in Nature, _vid. Sect._ XXV. whoever
therefore supposes them to Exist (allowing the Supposition possible) when they
are not perceived, does it manifestly to no purpose, since the only use that is
assign'd to them, as they Exist unperceiv'd, is that they produce those
perceivable Effects which, in truth, cannot be ascrib'd to any thing but Spirit.

{#62} \S 62 But to come nigher the Difficulty, it must be observ'd, that though
the Fabrication of all those Parts and Organs be not absolutely necessary to the
producing any Effect, yet it is necessary to the producing of things in a
constant, regular way, according to the Laws of Nature. There are certain
general Laws, that run thrô the whole Chain of Natural Effects, these are
learn'd by the Observation and Study of Nature, and are by Men applied as well
to the framing artificial Things, for the Use and Ornament of Life, as to the
explaining the various _Phaenomena_, which Explication consists only in shewing
the Conformity, any particular Phaenomenon hath to the general Laws of Nature,
or, which is the same thing, in discovering the _Vniformity_, there is in the
Production of natural Effects, as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the
several Instances, wherein Philosophers pretend to account for Appearances. That
there is a great and conspicuous Use in these regular, constant Methods of
working, observ'd by the Supreme Agent, has been shewn in _Sect._ XXXI. and it
is no less visible, that a particular Size, Figure, Motion and Disposition of
Parts are necessary, though not absolutely to the producing any Effect yet to
the producing it according to the Standing, Mechanical Laws of Nature. Thus, for
Instance, It cannot be denied that God, or the Intelligence that sustains and
rules the ordinary course of Things, might if He were minded to produce a
Miracle, cause all the Motions on the Dial-plate of a Watch, though no Body had
ever made the Movements, and put them in it: But yet if he will act agreeably to
the Rules of Mechanism, by him for wise Ends establish'd and maintain'd in the
Creation, it is necessary that those Actions of the Watchmaker, whereby he makes
the Movements and rightly adjusts them, precede the production of the aforesaid
Motions, as also that any disorder in them be attended with the Perception of
some corresponding Disorder, in the Movements, which being once Corrected all is
right again.

{#63} It may, indeed, on some Occasions be necessary, that the Author of Nature
display his over-ruling Power, in producing some Appearance out of the ordinary
Series of Things. Such Exceptions from the general Rules of Nature, are proper
to surprise and awe Men into an acknowledgment of the of the Divine Being: But
then they are to be used but seldom, otherwise there is a plain reason, why they
shou'd fail of that Effect. Besides, God seems to choose the convincing our
Reason of his Attributes by the works of Nature, which discover so much Harmony
and Contrivance in their Make, and are such plain Indications of Wisdom and
Beneficence in their Author, rather than to astonish us into a belief of his
Being by anomalous and surprising Events.

{#64} To set this Matter in a yet clearer Light, I shall observe that what has
been objected in _Sect._ LX. amounts in reality to no more than this. Ideas are
not any how and at random produced, there being a certain Order and Connexion
between them, like to that of Cause and Effect: There are also several
Combinations of them, made in a very Regular and Artificial Manner, which seem
like so many Instruments in the hand of Nature, that being hid as it were behind
the Scenes, have a secret Operation in producing those Appearances, which are
seen on the Theatre of the World, being themselves discernible only to the
curious Eye of the Philosopher. But since one Idea cannot be the Cause of
another, to what purpose is that Connexion? And since those Instruments, being
barely _inefficacious Perceptions_ in the Mind, are not subservient to the
Production of Natural Effects; it is demanded why they are made, or, in other
Words, what reason can be assign'd, why God shou'd make us upon a close
inspection into His Works, behold so great variety of Ideas, so artfully laid
together, and so much according to Rule: It not being imaginable, that he'd be
at the Expence (if one may so speak) of all that Art and Regularity to no
purpose.

{#65} To all which my Answer is, First, That the Connexion of Ideas does not
imply the Relation of _Cause_ and _Effect_, but only of a Mark or _Sign_ with
the Thing _signified_. The Fire which I see, is not the Cause of the Pain I
suffer upon my approaching it, but the Mark that forewarns me of it. In like
manner the Noise that I hear is not the Effect of this or that Motion, or
collision of the ambient Bodies, but the Sign thereof. Secondly, The reason why
Ideas are form'd into Machines, _i. e._ artificial and regular Combinations, is
the same with that for combining Letters into Words. That a few Original Ideas
may be made to signifie, a great number of Effects and Actions, 'tis necessary
they be variously combin'd together: And to the end their Use be permanent and
universal, these Combinations must be made by _Rule_, and with _wise
Contrivance_. By this means abundance of Information is convey'd unto us,
concerning what we are to expect from such and such Actions, and what Methods
are proper to be taken, for the Exciting such and such Ideas: Which in effect,
is all that I conceive to be distinctly meant, when it is said that by
discerning the Figure, Texture, and Mechanism of the inward Parts of Bodies,
whether Natural or Artificial, we may attain to know the several Uses and
Properties depending thereon, or the Nature of the Thing.

{#66} Hence it is evident, that those Things, which under the Notion of a Cause
co-operating or concurring to the production of Effects, are altogether
inexplicable, and run us into great Absurdities, may be very naturally
explain'd, and have a proper and obvious Use assign'd 'em, when they are
consider'd only as Marks, or Signs for our Information. And it is the searching
after, and endeavouring to understand this Language (if I may so call it) of the
Author of Nature, that ought to be the Employment of the Natural Philosopher;
and not the pretending to explain Things by Corporeal Causes, which Doctrine
seems to have too much estranged the Minds of Men, from that active Principle,
that supreme and wise Spirit, _in whom we Live, Move, and have our Being_.

{#67} \S 67 In the Twelfth place, it may perhaps be objected, that though it be
clear from what has been said, that there can be no such thing as an Inert,
Senseless, Extended, Solid, Figured, Moveable Substance Existing without the
Mind, such as Philosophers describe Matter: Yet if any Man shall leave out of
his Idea of _Matter_, the positive Ideas of Extension, Figure, Solidity and
Motion, and say that he means only by that word, an Inert, Senseless Substance
that Exists without the Mind or unperceiv'd, which is the Occasion of our Ideas,
or at the presence whereof God is pleased to excite Ideas in us: It doth not
appear, but that Matter taken in this Sense may possibly Exist. In Answer to
which I say, First, That it seems no less Absurd to suppose a Substance without
Accidents, than it is to suppose Accidents without a Substance. But Secondly,
Thô we shou'd grant this unknown Substance may possibly Exist, yet where can it
be supposed to be? That it Exists not in the Mind is agreed, and that it Exists
not in Place is no less certain; since all Place or Extension Exists only in the
Mind as hath been already prov'd. It remains therefore that it Exists no where
at all.

{#68} Let us examine a little, the description that is here given us of
_Matter_. It neither acts, nor perceives, nor is perceiv'd: For this is all
that's meant by saying it is an Inert, Senseless, Unknown Substance, which is a
Definition intirely made up of Negatives, excepting only the relative Notion of
its standing under or Supporting: But then it must be observ'd that it
_Supports_ nothing at all; and how nearly this comes to the description of a
_non-entity_, I desire may be consider'd. But say you it is the _unknown
occasion_, at the presence of which, Ideas are Excited in us by the will of God.
Now I wou'd fain know, how any thing can be present to us, which is neither
perceivable by Sense nor Reflexion, nor capable of producing any Idea in our
Minds, nor is at all extended, nor hath any Form, nor Exists in any place. The
words _to be present_, when thus applied, must needs be taken in some abstract
and strange Meaning, and which I am not able to comprehend.

{#69} Again, let us examine what is meant by _Occasion:_ So far as I can gather
from the common Use of Language, that Word signifies, either the Agent which
produces any Effect, or else something that is observ'd to accompany, or go
before it, in the ordinary course of things. But when it is applied to Matter as
above described, it can be taken in neither of those Senses. For Matter is said
to be Passive and Inert, and so cannot be an Agent or Efficient Cause. It is
also unperceivable as being devoid of all Sensible Qualities, and so cannot be
the Occasion of our Perceptions in the latter Sense: As when the burning my
Finger, is said to be the Occasion of the Pain that attends it. What therefore
can be meant by calling Matter an _Occasion?_ This Term is either used in no
Sense at all, or else in some very distant from its receiv'd Signification

{#70} You will perhaps say that Matter, though it be not perceiv'd by us, is
nevertheless perceived by GOD, to whom it is the Occasion of Exciting Ideas in
our Minds. For, say you, since we observe our Sensations to be imprinted in an
orderly and constant manner, it is but reasonable to suppose, there are certain
Constant, and Regular Occasions of their being produced. That is to say, that
there are certain permanent, and distinct parcels of Matter, corresponding to
our Ideas, which though they do not excite them in our Minds, or any wise
immediately affect us, as being altogether Passive and Unperceivable to Us, they
are nevertheless to GOD, by whom they are Perceiv'd, as it were so many
Occasions, to remind him when and what Ideas, to imprint on our Minds: that so
things may go on in a constant, uniform manner.

{#71} In answer to this I observe, that, as the Notion of Matter is here Stated,
the Question is no longer concerning the Existence of a Thing distinct from
_Spirit_ and _Idea_, from Perceiving and being Perceiv'd: But whether there are
not certain Ideas, of I know not what Sort, in the Mind of GOD, which are so
many Marks or Notes, that direct him how to produce Sensations in our Minds, in
a constant and regular Method: Much after the same manner, as a Musician is
directed by the Notes of Music, to produce that harmonious train and composition
of Sound, which is called a _Tune_; though they who Hear the Music do not
Perceive the Notes, and may be intirely ignorant of them. But this Notion of
Matter (which after all is the only intelligible one that I can pick, from what
is said of unknown Occasions) seems too extravagant to deserve a Confutation.
Besides, it is in effect no Objection against what we have advanced, _viz._ that
there is no senseless, unperceiv'd _Substance_.

{#72} If we follow the Light of Reason, we shall, from the constant uniform
Method of our Sensations, collect the Goodness and Wisdom of the _Spirit_ who
excites them in our Minds. But this is all that I can see reasonably concluded
from thence. To me, I say, 'tis evident that the Being of a _Spirit infinitely
Wise, Good, and Powerful_ is abundantly sufficient, to explain all the
Appearances of Nature. But as for _Inert, Sensless Matter_, nothing that I
perceive has any the least Connexion with it, or leads to the Thoughts of it.
And I wou'd fain see any one Explain, any the meanest _Phaenomenon_ in Nature by
it, or shew any manner of Reason, though in the lowest Rank of Probability, that
he can have for its Existence; or even make any tolerable Sense or Meaning of
that Supposition. For as to its being an Occasion, we have, I think, evidently
shewn that with regard to us it is no Occasion: It remains therefore that it
must be, if at all, the Occasion to GOD of exciting Ideas in us; and what this
amounts to we have just now seen.

{#73} It is worth while to reflect a little, on the Motives which induced Men to
suppose the Existence of Material Substance; that so having observ'd the gradual
Ceasing, and Expiration of those Motives or Reasons, we may proportionably
withdraw the Assent that was grounded on them. First, therefore, it was thought
that Colour, Figure, Motion, and the rest of the Sensible Qualities or
Accidents, did really Exist without the Mind; and for this reason, it seem'd
needful to suppose some unthinking _Substratum_, or _Substance_ wherein they did
Exist, since they cou'd not be conceived to Exist by themselves. Afterwards, in
process of time, Men being convinced that Colours, Sounds, and the rest of the
Sensible, Secondary Qualities had no Existence without the Mind, they stripped
this _Substratum_ or material Substance of those Qualities, leaving only the
Primary Ones, Figure, Motion, _&c._ which they still conceived to Exist
without the Mind, and consequently, to stand in need of a material Support. But
it having been shewn, that none, even of these, can possibly Exist otherwise
than in a Spirit or Mind which perceives them, it follows, that we have no
longer any reason, to suppose the being of _Matter_. Nay, that it is utterly
impossible there shou'd be any such thing, so long as that Word is taken to
denote, an _unthinking Substratum_ of Qualities or Accidents, wherein they Exist
without the Mind.

{#74} But though it be allow'd by the _Materialists_, themselves, that Matter
was thought of only for the sake of supporting Accidents; and the reason
intirely ceasing, one might expect the Mind shou'd naturally, and without any
reluctance at all, quit the belief of what was solely grounded thereon. Yet the
Prejudice is riveted so deeply in our Thoughts, that we can scarce tell how to
part with it, and are therefore inclined, since the _Thing_ it self is
indefensible, at least to retain the _Name_; which we apply to, I know not what,
abstracted and indefinite Notions of _Being, Occasion_, &c. though without
any shew of Reason, at least so far as I can see. For what is there, I beseech
you, on our part, or what do we perceive amongst all the Ideas, Sensations,
Notions, which are imprinted on our Minds, either by Sense or Reflexion, from
whence may be infer'd the Existence of an inert, thoughtless, unperceiv'd
Occasion? and on the other hand, on the part of an _All-sufficient Spirit_, what
can there be that shou'd make us believe, or even suspect, he is _directed_ by
an inert Occasion to excite Ideas in our Minds?

{#75} It is a very extraordinary Instance of the force of Prejudice, and much to
be lamented, that the Mind of Man retains so great a Fondness, against all the
evidence of Reason, for a stupid, thoughtless _Somewhat_, by the interposition
whereof it wou'd, as it were, skreen it self, from the Providence of God, and
remove it farther off from the Affairs of the World. But though we do the utmost
we can, to secure the belief of _Matter_, though when Reason forsakes us, we
endeavour to support our Opinion on the bare possibility of the Thing, and
though we Indulge our selves in the full Scope, of an Imagination not regulated
by Reason, to make out that poor _Possibility_, yet the Up-shot of all is, that
there certain _unknown Ideas_ in the Mind of God; for this, if any thing, is all
that I conceive to be meant by _Occasion_ with regard to God. And this, at the
Bottom, is no longer contending for the _Thing_, but for the _Name_.

{#76} Whether therefore there are such Ideas in the Mind of GOD, and whether
they may be called by the name _Matter_ I shan't dispute. But if you stick to
the Notion of an unthinking Substance, or Support of Extension, Motion,
_&c._ then to me it is most evidently impossible, there shou'd be any such
thing. Since it is a plain Repugnancy, that those Qualities shou'd Exist in or
be supported by an unperceiving Substance.

{#77} But say you, though it be granted that there is no thoughtless support of
Extension, and the other Qualities or Accidents which we Perceive; yet there
may, perhaps, be some Inert, Unperceiving Substance, or _Substratum_ of some
other Qualities, as incomprehensible to us as Colours are to a Man born Blind,
because we have not a Sense adapted to them. But if we had a new Sense, we
shou'd possibly no more doubt of their Existence, than a Blind-man made to See
does of the Existence of Light and Colours. I answer, First, if what you mean by
the word _Matter_ be only the unknown Support of unknown Qualities, it's no
matter whether there is such a thing or no; since it no way concerns us: And for
my part, I do not see the Advantage there is in disputing about we know not
_what_, and we know not _why_.

{#78} But, Secondly, if we had a new Sense it cou'd only furnish us with new
Ideas or Sensations: And then we shou'd have the same reason, against their
Existing in an unperceiving Substance, that has been already offer'd with
relation to Figure, Motion, Colour, _&c._ Qualities, as hath been shewn, are
nothing else but _Sensations_ or _Ideas_, which Exist only in a _Mind_
perceiving them; and this is true not only of the Ideas we are acquainted with
at present, but likewise of all possible Ideas whatsoever.

{#79} But you will insist, what if I have no reason to believe the Existence of
Matter, what if I cannot assign any use to it, or explain any thing by it, or
even conceive what is meant by that Word? Yet still it is no Contradiction to
say that Matter Exists, and that this Matter is _in general_ a _Substance_, or
_Occasion of Ideas_; though, indeed, to go about to unfold the meaning, or
adhere to any particular Explication of those Words, may be attended with great
Difficulties. I answer, when Words are used without a Meaning, you may put them
together as you please, without danger of running into a Contradiction. You may
say, for Example, that _twice Two_ is equal to _Seven_, so long as you declare
you do not take the Words of that Proposition in their usual Acception, but for
Marks of you know not what. And by the same reason you may say, there is an
inert, thoughtless Substance without Accidents, which is the occasion of our
Ideas. And we shall understand just as much by one Proposition, as the other.

{#80} In the last place, you will say, What if we give up the Cause of material
Substance, and stand to it, that Matter is an unknown _Somewhat_, neither
Substance nor Accident, Spirit nor Idea, Inert, Thoughtless, Indivisible,
Immoveable, Unextended, Existing in no Place? For, say you, Whatever may be
urged against _Substance_ or _Occasion_, or any other positive or relative
Notion of Matter hath no place at all, so long as this _negative_ Definition of
Matter is adhered to. I answer you may, if so it shall seem good, use the word
_Matter_ in the same Sense, that other Men use _Nothing_, and so make those
Terms convertible in your Stile. For after all, this is what appears to me to be
the Result of that Difinition, the Parts whereof when I consider with Attention,
either collectively, or separate from each other, I do not find that there's any
kind of Effect or Impression made on my Mind, different from what is excited by
term _Nothing_.

{#81} Upon this, you'll Reply that in the foresaid Definition, is included, what
doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing, the positive, abstract Idea of
_Quiddity, Entity_, or _Existence_. I own indeed, that those who pretend to the
Faculty of framing Abstract, General Ideas, do talk as if they had such an Idea,
which is, say they, the most abstract and general Notion of all, that is, to me,
the most Incomprehensible of all Others. That there are a great variety of
Spirits of different Orders and Capacities, whose Faculties, both in Number and
Extent, are far exceeding those the Author of my Being has bestowed on me, I see
no reason to deny. And for me, to pretend to determine, by my own few, stinted,
narrow Inlets of Perception, what Ideas the inexhaustible Power of the SUPREME
SPIRIT may Imprint upon 'em, were certainly the utmost Folly and Presumption.
Since there may be, for ought that I know, innumerable sorts of Ideas or
Sensations, as different from one another, and from all that I have perceiv'd,
as Colours are from Sounds. But how ready soever I may be, to acknowledge the
Scantiness of my Comprehension, with regard to the endless variety of Spirits
and Ideas, that may possibly Exist, yet for any one to pretend to a Notion of
Entity or Existence, _abstracted_ from _Spirit_ and _Idea_, from Perceiving and
being Perceiv'd, is, I suspect, a downright Repugnancy nnd Trifling with Words.
It remains that we consider the Objections, which may possibly be made on the
part of Religion.

{#82} Some there are who think, that though the Arguments for the real Existence
of Bodies, which are drawn from Reason, be allow'd not to amount to
Demonstration, yet the Holy Scriptures are so clear in the Point, as will
sufficiently convince every good Christian, that Bodies do really Exist, and are
something more than meer Ideas; there being in Holy Writ innumerable Facts
related, which evidently suppose the reality of Timber, and Stone, Mountains,
and Rivers, and Cities, and Human Bodies, _&c._ To which I Answer, that no
sort of Writings, whatever Sacred or Profane, which use those and the like Words
in the Vulgar Acceptation, or so as to have a meaning in 'em, are in danger of
having their Truth call'd in question by our Doctrine. That all those Things do
really Exist, that there are Bodies, even Corporeal Substances, when taken in
the Vulgar Sense, has been shewn to be agreeable to our Principles: And the
difference betwixt _Things_ and _Ideas, Realities_ and _Chimeras_, has been
distinctly Explain'd, _vid. Sect._ XXIX, XXX, XXXIII, XXXVI, _&c._ And I do
not think, that either what Philosophers call _Matter_, or the Existence of
Objects without the Mind is any where mention'd in Scripture.

{#83} Again, whether there be, or be not External Things, it is agreed on all
hands, that the proper Use of Words, is the marking our Conceptions, or Things
only as they are Known and Perceiv'd by us; whence it plainly follows, that in
the Tenents we have laid down, there is nothing inconsistent with the right Use
and Significancy of _Language_ and that Discourse of what kind soever, so far as
it is Intelligible, remains Undisturb'd. But all this seems so very manifest,
from what hath been largely set forth in the Premises, that it is needless to
insist any farther on it.

{#84} But it will be urg'd, that Miracles do, at least, lose much of their
Stress and Import, by our Principles. What must we think of _Moses_'s Rod, was
it not _really_ turn'd into a Serpent, or was there only a Change of _Ideas_ in
the Minds of the Spectators? And can it be supposed, that our Saviour did no
more at the Marriage-Feast in _Cana_, than impose on the Sight, and Smell, and
Taste of the Guests, so as to create in them the Appearance or Idea only of
Wine? The same may be said of all other Miracles: Which, in consequence of the
foregoing Principles, must be look'd upon only as so many Cheats, or Illusions
of Fancy. To this I Reply, that the Rod was changed into a real Serpent, and the
Water into real Wine. That this does not, in the least, contradict what I have
elsewhere said, will be evident from _Sect._ XXXIV, and XXXV. But this Business
of _Real_ and _Imaginary_ has been already so plainly and fully Explain'd, and
so often Refer'd to, and the Difficulties about it are so easily Answer'd from
what has gone before, that it were an Affront to the Reader's Understanding, to
resume the Explication of it in this place. I shall only observe, that if at
Table all who were present shou'd See, and Smell, and Taste, and Drink Wine, and
find the effects of it, with me there cou'd be no doubt of it's Reality. So
that, at Bottom, the Scruple concerning real Miracles has no place at all on
ours, but only on the receiv'd Principles, and consequently makes rather _for_,
than _against_ what has been said.

{#85} Having done with the Objections, which I endeavour'd to propose in the
clearest Light, and gave them all the Force and Weight I cou'd, we proceed in
the next place to take a view of our Tenents in their Consequences. Some of
these appear at first Sight, as that several Difficult and obscure Questions, on
which abundance of Speculation has been thrown away, are intirely banish'd from
Philosophy. Whether Corporeal Substance can think: Whether Matter be infinitely
Divisible: And how it Operates on Spirit; these and the like Inquiries have
given infinite Amusement to Philosophers, in all Ages. But depending on the
Existence of _Matter_, they have no longer any place on our Principles. Many
other Advantages there are, as well with regard to _Religion_ as the _Sciences_,
which it is easy for any one to deduce, from what has been premised. But this
will appear more plainly in the Sequel.

{#86} From the Principles we have laid down, it follows, Human Knowledge many
naturally be reduced to two Heads, that of _Ideas_, and that of _Spirits_. Of
each of these I shall treat in Order. And first as to Ideas or Unthinking
Things, our Knowledge of these has been very much obscur'd, and confounded, and
we have been led into very dangerous Errors, by supposing a two-fold Existence
of the Objects of Sense, the one _Intelligible_, or in the Mind, the other
_Real_ and without the Mind: Whereby Unthinking Things are thought, to have a
natural Subsistence of their own, distinct from being perceiv'd by Spirits. This
which, if I mistake not, hath been shewn to be a most groundless and absurd
Notion, is the very Root of _Scepticism_; for so long as Men thought that Real
Things subsisted without the Mind, and that their Knowledge was only so far
forth _Real_ as it was conformable to _real Things_, it follows, they cou'd not
be certain, that they had any real Knowledge at all. For how can it be known,
that the Things which are Perceiv'd, are conformable to those which are not
Perceiv'd, or Exist without the Mind?

{#87} Colour, Figure, Motion, Extension and the like, consider'd only as so many
_Sensations_ in the Mind, are perfectly known, there being nothing in them which
is not Perceiv'd. But if they are look'd on as Notes or Images, refered to
_Things_ or _Archetypes_ Existing without the Mind, then are we involved all in
_Scepticism_. We see only the Appearances, and not the real Qualities of Things.
What may be the Extension, Figure, or Motion of any Thing really and absolutely,
or in it self, its impossible for us to know, but only the proportion or
relation they bear to our Senses. Things remaining the same, our Ideas vary, and
which of them, or even whether any of them at all, represent the true Quality
really Existing in the Thing, it is out of our Reach to determine. So that, for
ought we know, all we See, Hear, and Feel, may be only Phantome and vain
Chimera, and not at all agree with the Real Things, Existing in _Rerum Natura_.
All this Sceptical Cant follows, from our supposing a difference between
_Things_ and _Ideas_, and that the former have a Subsistence without the Mind,
or Unperceiv'd. It were easy to dilate on this Subject, and shew how the
Arguments urged by _Sceptics_ in all Ages, depend on the supposition of External
Objects. But this is too obvious to need being insisted on.

{#88} So long as we attribute a real Existence to Unthinking Things, distinct
from their being perceiv'd, it is not only impossible, for us to know with
evidence the Nature of any real, unthinking Being, but even that it Exists.
Hence it is, that we see Philosophers distrust their Senses, and doubt of the
Existence of Heaven and Earth, of every thing they See or Feel, even of their
own Bodies. And after all their labouring and struggle of Thought, they are
forced to own, we cannot attain to any self-evident, or demonstrative Knowledge,
of the Existence of sensible Things. But all this Doubtfulness, which so
Bewilders and Confounds the Mind, and makes _Philosophy_ ridiculous in the Eyes
of the World, vanishes if we annex a meaning to our Words, and not amuse our
selves with the terms _Absolute, External, Exist_, &c. signifying we know
not what. For my part, I can as well doubt of my own Being, as of the Being of
those things, which I actually perceive by Sense: It being a manifest
Contradiction, that any sensible Object shou'd be immediately perceiv'd by Sight
or Touch, and, at the same time, have no Existence in Nature, since the very
Existence of an unthinking Being, consists in _being perceiv'd_.

{#89} Nothing seems of more Importance, towards Erecting a firm System of sound
and real Knowledge, which may be Proof against the Assaults of _Scepticism_,
than to lay the beginning in a distinct Explication, of what is meant by _Thing,
Reality, Existence_: For in vain shall we Dispute, concerning the real Existence
of Things, or pretend to any Knowledge thereof, so long as we have not fix'd the
meaning of those Words. _Thing_ or _Being_ is the most general Name of all, it
comprehends under it two Kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous, and which
have nothing common but the Name, _viz. Spirits_ and _Ideas_. The former are
_Active, Indivisible, Incorruptible Substances:_ The latter are _Inert,
Fleeting, Perishable Passions_, or _Dependent Beings_, which subsist not by
themselves, but are supported by, or Exist in Minds or Spiritual Substances.

{#90} Ideas imprinted on the Senses are real Things, or do really Exist, this we
do not deny, but we deny they can subsist without the Minds which perceive them,
or that they are Resemblances of any Archetypes Existing without the Mind: Since
the very Being of a Sensation or Idea consists in being perceived, and an Idea
can be like nothing but an Idea. Again the Things perceived by Sense may be
termed _External_, with regard to their Origine, in that they are not generated
from within, by the Mind it self, but imprinted by a Spirit distinct from that
which perceives them. Sensible Objects may likewise be said to be without the
Mind, in another sense, namely when they Exist in some other Mind. Thus when I
shut my Eyes, the Things I saw may still Exist, but it must be in another Mind.

{#91} It were a mistake to think, that what is here said derogates in the least,
from the Reality of Things. It is acknowleg'd on the receiv'd Principles, that
Extension, Motion, and in a Word, all sensible Qualities have need of a Support,
as not being able to subsist by themselves. But the Objects perceiv'd by Sense,
are allow'd to be nothing but Combinations of those Qualities, and consequently
cannot subsist by themselves. Thus far it is agreed on all hands. So that in
denying the Things perceiv'd by Sense, an Existence independent of a Substance,
or Support wherein they may Exist, we detract nothing from the receiv'd Opinion
of their _Reality_, and are guilty of no Innovation in that respect. All the
Difference is, that according to us the Unthinking Beings perceiv'd by Sense,
have no Existence distinct from being Perceiv'd, and cannot therefore Exist in
any other Substance, than those Unextended, Indivisible Substances, or
_Spirits_, which act, and think, and perceive them: Whereas Philosophers
vulgarly hold, the Sensible Qualities do Exist in an Inert, Extended,
Unperceiving Substance, which they call _Matter_, to which they attribute a
Natural Subsistence, exterior to all Thinking Beings, or distinct from being
perceiv'd by any Mind whatsoever, even the Eternal Mind of the CREATOR, wherein
they suppose only Ideas of the Corporeal Substances created by him. If indeed
they allow them to be at all Created.

{#92} For as we have shewn the Doctrine of Matter or Corporeal Substance, to
have been the main Pillar and Support of _Scepticism_, so likewise upon the same
Foundation have been rais'd all the Impious Schemes of _Atheism_ and Irreligion.
Nay so great a difficulty has it been thought, to conceive Matter produced out
of Nothing, that the most Celebrated among the Ancient Philosophers, even of
these who maintain'd the Being of a GOD, have thought Matter to be Uncreated and
Coeternal with him. How great a Friend material Substance has been to _Atheists_
in all Ages, were needless to relate. All their monstrous Systems have so
visible and necessary a dependence on it, that when this Corner-Stone is once
remov'd, the whole Fabrick cannot choose but fall to the Ground. insomuch that
it is no longer worth while, to bestow a particular Consideration on the
Absurdities of every wretched Sect of _Atheists_.

{#93} That Impious and Profane Persons, shou'd readily fall in with those
Systems, which favour their Inclinations, by deriding Immaterial Substance, and
supposing the Soul to be Divisible, and subject to Corruption as the Body, which
exclude all Freedom, Intelligence, and Design from the Formation of Things, and
instead thereof make a Self-existent, Stupid, Unthinking Substance the Root and
Origine of all Beings. That they shou'd hearken to those who deny a Providence,
or Inspection of a Superior Mind over the Affairs of the World, attributing the
whole Series of Events either to Blind Chance, or Fatal Necessity arising from
the Impulse of one Body on another. All this is very natural. And on the other
hand, when Men of better Principles observe the Enemies of Religion lay so great
a Stress on _Vnthinking Matter_; and all of them use so much Industry and
Artifice to reduce every thing to it; methinks they shou'd Rejoyce to see them
Depriv'd of their grand Support, and driven from that only Fortress, without
which your _Epicureans, Hobbists_, and the like, have not even the Shadow of a
Pretence, but become the most cheap and easy Triumph in the World.

{#94} The Existence of Matter, or Bodies unperceiv'd, has not only been the main
Support of _Atheists_ and _Fatalists_, but on the Principle does _Idolatry_
likewise in all its various Forms, depend. Did Men but consider that the Sun,
Moon, and Stars and every other Object of the Senses, are only so many
Sensations in their Minds, which have no other Existence but barely being
Perceiv'd: Doubtless they wou'd never fall down, and worship their own _Ideas_.
But rather address their Homage to that ETERNAL INVISIBLE MIND which produces
and sustains all Things.

{#95} The same absurd Principle, by mingling it self with the Articles of our
Faith, has occasion'd no small Difficulties to Christians. For Example, about
the _Resurrection_, how many Scruples and Objections have been raised by
_Socinians_ and Others? But do not the most plausible of them depend on the
supposition, that a Body is denominated the _same_, with regard not to the Form
or that which is perceiv'd by Sense, but the Material Substance, which remains
the same under several Forms? Take away this _Material Substance_, about the
Identity whereof all the Dispute is, and mean by _Body_ what every plain,
ordinary Person means by that Word, _viz._ that which is immediately Seen and
Felt, which is only a Combination of sensible Qualities, or Ideas: And then
their most unanswerable Objections come to nothing.

{#96} Matter being once expell'd out of Nature, drags with it so many Sceptical
and Impious Notions, such an incredible number of Disputes and puzling
Questions, which have been Thorns in the sides of Divines, as well as
Philosophers, and made so much fruitless Work for Mankind; that if the Arguments
we have produced against it, are not found equal to Demonstration (as to me they
evidently seem) yet I am sure all Friends to Knowledge, Peace, and Religion have
reason to wish they were.

{#97} Beside the external Existence of the Objects of Perception, another great
Source of Errors and Difficulties, with regard to Ideal Knowledge, is the
Doctrine of _Abstract Ideas_, such as it hath been set forth in the
Introduction. The plainest things in the World, those we are most intimately
acquainted with, and perfectly know, when they are consider'd in an Abstract
way, appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible. Time, Place, and Motion,
taken in particular, or concrete, are what every Body knows; but having passed
thro' the Hands of a Metaphysician, they become too Abstract and Fine, to be
apprehended by Men of ordinary Sense. Bid your Servant meet you at such a
_Time_, in such a _Place_, and he shall never stay to deliberate on the meaning
of those Words: In conceiving that particular Time and Place, or the Motion by
which he is to get thither, he finds not the least Difficulty. But if _Time_ be
taken, exclusive of all those particular Actions and Ideas that diversifie the
Day, meerly for the Continuation of Existence, or Duration in Abstract, then it
will perhaps Gravel even a Philosopher to comprehend it.

{#98} For my own part, whenever I attempt to frame a simple Idea of _Time_,
abstracted from the succession of Ideas in my Mind, which flows uniformly, and
is participated by all Beings, I am lost and embrangled in inextricable
Difficulties. I have no Notion of it at all, only I hear others say, it is
infinitely Divisible, and speak of it in such a manner, as leads me to harbour
odd Thoughts of my Existence: Since that Doctrine lays one under an absolute
necessity, of thinking, either that he passes away innumerable Ages without a
Thought, or else that he is annihilated every moment of his Life: Both which
seem equally absurd. Time therefore being nothing, abstracted from the Successon
of Ideas in our Minds, it follows, that the Duration of any Finite Spirit must
be estimated, by the Number of Ideas or Actions succeeding each other, in that
same Spirit or Mind. Hence it is a plain Consequence that, the Soul always
thinks: And in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his Thoughts, or
abstract the _Existence_ of a Spirit from its _Cogitation_ will, I believe, find
it no easy Task.

{#99} So likewise, when we attempt to abstract Extension and Motion, from all
other Qualities, and consider them by themselves,, we presently lose sight of
'em, and run into great Extravagancies. Hence spring those odd Paradoxes, that
the _Fire is not Hot_, nor _the Wall White_, &c. or that Heat and Colour are
in the Objects, nothing but Figure and Motion. All which depend on a two-fold
Abstraction: First it is supposed that Extension, for example, may be abstracted
from all other sensible Qualities; and Secondly, that the Entity of Extension,
may be abstracted from its being Perceiv'd. But whoever shall reflect, and take
care to understand what he says, will, if I mistake not, acknowledge that all
sensible Qualities are alike _Sensations_, and alike _Real_, that where the
Extension is, there is the Colour too, _i. e._ in his Mind, and that their
Archetypes, can exist only in some other _Mind_. And that the Objects of Sense
are nothing but those Sensations combin'd, blended or (if one may so speak)
concreted together: None of all which can be suppos'd to Exist unperceiv'd. And
that, consequently, the Wall is as truly White, as it is Extended, and in the
same Sense.

{#100} What it is for a Man to be Happy, or an Object Good, every one may think
he knows. But to frame an Abstract Idea of _Happiness_, prescinded from all
particular Pleasure, or of _Goodness_, from every thing that is Good, this is
what few can pretend to. So likewise, a Man may be Just and Virtuous, without
having precise Ideas of _Justice_ and _Virtue_. The opinion that those and the
like Words, stand for General Notions abstracted from all particular Persons and
Actions, seems to have render'd Morality very difficult, and the Study thereof
of small use to Mankind. And, in effect, one may make a great progress in
_School-Ethics_, without ever being the wiser or better Man for it, or knowing
how to behave himself in the affairs of Life, more to the Advantage of himself,
or his Neighbours, than he did before. This Hint may suffice, to let any one
see, the Doctrine of _Abstraction_, has not a little contributed, towards
spoiling the most useful Parts of Knowledge.

{#101} The two great Provinces of Speculative Science, conversant about Ideas
receiv'd from Sense, are _Natural Philosophy_ and _Mathematics_; with regard to
each of these I shall make some Observations. And first I shall say somewhat of
Natural Philosophy. On this Subject it is, that the _Sceptics_ triumph: All that
stock of Arguments they produce to depreciate our Faculties, and make Mankind
appear Ignorant and Low, are drawn principally from this Head, namely, that we
are under an Invincible Blindness, as to the _True_ and _Real_ Nature of Things.
This they exaggerate, and love to enlarge on. We are miserably Banter'd, say
they, by our Senses, and amus'd only with the Outside and Shew of Things. The
real Essence, the internal Qualities, and Constitution of every the meanest
Object, is hid from our view; something there is, in every drop of Water, every
grain of Sand, which it is beyond the Power of Human Understanding, to Fathom or
Comprehend. But it is evident from what has been shewn, that all this Complaint
is groundless, and that we are influenced by False Principles, to that degree as
to mistrust our Senses, and think we know nothing, of those things which we
perfectly comprehend.

{#102} One great Inducement, to our pronouncing our selves Ignorant of the
Nature of Things, is, the current Opinion that every thing includes within it
self, the Cause of its Properties: Or that there is in each Object, an inward
Essence, which is the Source whence its discernible Qualities flow, and whereon
they depend. Some have pretended to account for Appearances by Occult Qualities,
but of late they are mostly resolved into Mechanical Causes. _viz._ the Figure,
Motion, Weight, _&c._ of insensible Particles: Whereas, in truth, there is
no other Agent or Efficient Cause than _Spirit_, it being evident, that Motion,
as well as all other _Ideas_, is perfectly Inert. _vid. Sect._ XXV. Hence, to
endeavour to explain the production of Colours, Sounds, _&c._ by Figure,
Motion, Magnitude and the like, must needs be labour in vain. And accordingly,
we see the Attempts of that Kind, are not at all satisfactory. Which may be
said, in general, of those Instances, wherein one Idea or Quality is assign'd
for the Cause of another. I need not say, how many _Hypotheses_ and Speculations
are left out, and how much the study of Nature is Abridged by this Doctrine.

{#103} The great Mechanical Principle now in Vogue is _Attraction_. That a Stone
falls to the Earth, or the Sea swells towards the Moon, may to some appear
sufficiently explain'd thereby. But how are we Enlighten'd by being told this is
done by Attraction? Is it that, that Word signifies the manner of the Tendency,
and that it is by the mutual drawing of Bodies, instead of their being impell'd
or protruded towards each other? But nothing is determin'd of the Manner or
Action, and it may as truly (for ought we know) be termed _Impulse_ or
_Protrusion_ as _Attraction_. Again, the Parts of Steel we see cohere firmly
together, and this also is accounted for by Attraction; but in this, as in the
other Instances, I do not perceive, that any thing is signified besides the
Effect it self; for as to the manner of the Action whereby it is produced, or
the Cause which produces it, these are not so much as aim'd at.

{#104} Indeed, if we take a view of the several _Phaenomena_, and compare them
together, we may observe some likeness and conformity between them. For Example,
in the Falling of a Stone to the Ground, In the Rising of the Sea towards the
Moon, in Cohesion, Crystallization, _&c._ there is something alike, namely
an Union or Mutual Approach of Bodies. So that any one of these, or the like
_Phaenomena_, may not seem Strange, or Surprising, to a Man who has nicely
observ'd and compar'd the Effects of Nature. For that only is thought so which
is uncommon, or a thing by it self, and out of the ordinary Course of our
Observation. That Bodies shou'd tend towards the Center of the Earth, is not
thought strange, because 'tis what we perceive every moment of our Lives. But
that they shou'd have a like Gravitation towards the Center of the Moon, may
seem odd and unaccountable to most Men, because it's discern'd only in the
Tides. But a Philosopher, whose Thoughts take in a larger compass of Nature,
having observ'd a certain similitude of Appearances, as well in the Heavens as
the Earth, that argue innumerable Bodies to have a mutual Tendency towards each
other, which he denotes by the general Name _Attraction_, whatever can be
reduced to that he thinks justly accounted for. Thus he explains the Tides, by
the Attraction of the Terraqueous Globe towards the Moon, which to him does not
appear odd or anomalous, but only a particular Example of a general Rule or Law
of Nature.

{#105} If, therefore, we consider the Difference there is betwixt Natural
Philosophers, and other Men, with regard to their Knowledge of the _Phaenomena_,
we shall find it consists, not in an exacter Knowledge of the efficient Cause
that produces them, for that can be no other than the _Will of a Spirit_, but
only in a greater Largeness of Comprehension, whereby Analogies, Harmonies, and
Agreements are discover'd in the Works of Nature, and the particular Effects
explain'd, _i. e._ reduced to general Rules, _vid. Sect._ LXII. which Rules
grounded on the Analogy, and Uniformness observ'd in the Production of Natural
Effects, are most agreeable, and sought after by the Mind, for that they extend
our Prospect beyond what is present, and near to us, and enable us to make very
probable Conjectures, touching Things that may have happen'd at very great
distances of Time and Place, as well as to predict Things to come; which sort of
Endeavour towards Omniscience, is much affected by the Mind.

{#106} But we shou'd proceed warily in such Things, for we are apt to lay too
great a Stress on Analogies, and to the prejudice of Truth, humour that
Eagerness of the Mind, whereby it is carried to extend its Knowledge into
general Theoremes. For Example, In the business of Gravitation, or mutual
Attraction, because it appears in many Instances, some are straightway for
pronouncing it _Universal_; and that _to Attract, and be Attracted by, every
other Body is an Essential Quality, inherent in all Bodies whatsoever_. Whereas,
its evident the Fix'd Stars have no such Tendency towards each other; and so far
is that Gravitation, from being _Essential_ to Bodies, that, in some Instances a
quite contrary Principle seems to shew it self: As in the Perpendicular Growth
of Plants, and the Elasticity of the Air. There is nothing Necessary or
Essential in the Case, but it depends intirely on the Will of the _Governing
Spirit_, who causes certain Bodies to cleave together, or tend towards each
other, according to various Laws; whilst he keeps others at a fix'd Distance;
and to some he gives a quite contrary Tendency to fly asunder, just, as he sees
convenient.

{#107} After what has been premis'd, I think we may lay down the following
Conclusions. First, 'Tis plain, Philosophers amuse themselves in vain, when they
inquire for any Natural, Efficient Cause, distinct from a _Mind_ or _Spirit_.
Secondly, Considering the whole Creation is the Workmanship of a _Wise and Good
Agent_, it shou'd seem to become Philosophers, to employ their Thoughts
(contrary to what some hold) about the Final Causes of Things: For besides that
this wou'd prove a very pleasing Entertainment to the Mind, it might be of great
Advantage, in that it not only discovers to us the Attributes of the CREATOR,
but may also direct us in several Instances to the proper Uses and Applications
of Things; and I must confess, I see no reason, why pointing out the various
Ends, to which Natural Things are adapted, and for which they were originally,
with unspeakable Wisdom, contriv'd, shou'd not be thought one good way of
accounting for them, and altogether worthy a Philosopher. Thirdly, from what has
been premis'd no reason can be drawn, why the History of Nature shou'd not still
be studied, and Observations and Experiments made, which, that they are of use
to Mankind, and enable us to draw any general Conclusions, is not the Result of
any immutable Habitudes, or Relations between Things themselves, but only of
GOD'S Goodness and Kindness to Men, in the Administration of the World. _vid.
Sect._ XXX and XXXI. Fourthly, By a diligent Observation of the _Phaenomena_
within our View, we may discover the general Laws of Nature, and from them
deduce the other _Phaenomena_, I do not say _Demonstrate_; for all Deductions of
that kind, depend on a Supposition that the Author of Nature always operates
uniformly, and in a constant observance of those Rules, we take for Principles:
Which we cannot evidently know.

{#108} It appears from _Sect._ LXVI, _&c._ that the steady, consistent
Methods of Nature, may not unfitly be Stiled the _Language_ of its _Author_,
whereby he discovers his _Attributes_ to our View, and directs us how to act for
the Convenience and Felicity of Life. And to me, those Men who frame General
Rules from the _Phaenomena_, and afterwards derive the _Phaenomena_ from those
Rules, seem to be Grammarians, and their Art the Grammar of Nature. Two ways
there are of Learning a Language, either by Rule or by Practise: A Man may be
well read in the Language of of Nature, without understanding the Grammar of it,
or being able to say, by what Rule a Thing is so or so. And as 'tis very
possible to Write Improperly, thro' too strict an Observance of General
Grammar-rules: So in Arguing from General Laws of Nature, 'tis not impossible we
may stretch the Analogy too far, and by that means run into Mistakes.

{#109} To carry on the resemblance, as in reading other Books, a Wise Man will
chuse to fix his Thoughts, on the Sense and apply it to Use, rather than lay
them out in Grammatical Remarks on the Language; so in perusing the Volume of
Nature, methinks it is beneath the Dignity of the Mind, to affect an Exactness,
in reducing each particular _Phaenomenon_ to general Rules, or shew how it
follows from them. We shou'd propose to our selves nobler Views, namely to
recreate and exalt the Mind, with a prospect of the Beauty, Order, Extent, and
Variety of Natural Things: Hence, by proper Inferences, to enlarge our Notions
of the Grandeur, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the CREATOR: And lastly, to make the
several Parts of the Creation, so far as in us lies, subservient to the Ends
they were design'd for, GOD'S Glory, and the Sustentation and Comfort of our
Selves and Fellow-Creatures.

{#110} The best Grammar of the kind we are speaking of, will be easily
acknowleg'd to be a Treatise of Mechanics, demonstrated and applied to Nature,
by a Philosopher of a Neighbouring Nation whom all the World Admire. I shall not
take upon me to make Remarks, on the Performance of that Extraordinary Person:
Only some Things he has advanced, so directly opposite to the Doctrine we have
hitherto laid down, that we shou'd be wanting, in the regard due to the
Authority of so great a Man, did we not take some notice of them. In the
Entrance of that justly admired Treatise, Time, Space and Motion, are
distinguished into _Absolute_ and _Relative, True_ and _Apparent, Mathematical_
and _Vulgar:_ Which Distinction, as it is at large explain'd by the Author, does
suppose those Quantities to have an Existence without the Mind: And that they
are ordinarily conceiv'd with relation to sensible Things, to which
nevertheless, in their own Nature, they bear no Relation at all.

{#111} As for _Time_, as it is there taken in an absolute or abstracted Sense,
for the Duration or Perseverance of the Existence of Things, I have nothing more
to add concerning it, after what has been already said, on that Subject. For the
rest, this Celebrated Author holds there is an _Absolute Space_, which, being
unperceivable to Sense, remains in it self similar and immoveable: And Relative
Space to be the measure thereof, which being moveable, and defin'd by its
Situation in respect of Sensible Bodies, is vulgarly taken for Immoveable Space.
_Place_ he Defines, to be that Part of Space which is occupied by any Body. And
according as the Space is Absolute or Relative, so also is the Place. _Absolute
Motion_ is said to be the Translation of a Body, from Absolute Place to Absolute
Place, as Relative Motion is, from one Relative Place to another. Now because
the Parts of Absolute Space, do not fall under our Senses, instead of them we
are obliged to use their Sensible Measures: And so define both Place and Motion
with respect to Bodies, which we regard as immoveable. But it is said, in
Philosophical Matters we must Abstract from our Senses, since it may be, that
none of those Bodies, which seem to be quiescent, are truely so: And the same
thing which is mov'd Relatively, may be really at rest. As likewise one and the
same Body may be in Relative Rest and Motion, or even mov'd with contrary
Relative Motions, At the same time, according as its place is variously defin'd.
All which Ambiguity is to be found in the apparent Motions, but not at all in
the true or absolute, which shou'd therefore he alone regarded in Philosophy.
And the True, we are told, are distinguish'd from Apparent or Relative Motions,
by the following Properties. First, In True or Absolute Motion, all Parts which
preserve the same Position with respect to the Whole, partake of the Motions of
the Whole. Secondly, The Place being moved, that which is placed therein is also
mov'd: So that a Body moving in a place which is in Motion, doth participate the
Motion of its Place. Thirdly, True Motion is never generated or changed,
otherwise then by Force impressed on the Body it self. Fourthly, True Motion is
always changed, by Force impressed on the Body moved. Fifthly, In Circular
Motion barely Relative, there is no Centrifugal Force, which nevertheless in
that which is True or Absolute, is proportional to the Quantity of Motion.

{#112} But notwithstanding what has been said, I must confess, it does not
appear to me, that there can be any Motion other than _Relative_, So that to
conceive Motion, there must be at least conceived two Bodies, whereof the
Distance or position in regard to each other is varied. Hence if there was one
only Body in being, it cou'd not possibly be mov'd. This to me seems very
evident, in that the Idea I have of Motion does necessarily involve relation it.
Whether others can conceive it otherwise, a little Attention may satisfie them.

{#113} But tho' in every Motion, it be necessary to conceive more Bodies than
one, yet it may be that one only is moved, namely that on which the Force
causing the change, in the Distance or Situation of the Bodies, is impressed.
For however some may define Relative Motion, so as to term that Body _mov'd_,
which changes its Distance from some other Body, whether the Force causing that
Change were impressed on it, or no: Yet I can't assent to this, for since we are
told, Relative Motion is that which is perceiv'd by Sense, and regarded in the
ordinary Affairs of Life, it follows that every Man of common Sense knows what
it is, as well as the best Philosopher: Now I ask any one, whether in his Sense
of Motion, as he walks along the Streets, the Stones he passes over may be said
to _move_, because they change Distance with his Feet? To me it appears, that
though Motion includes a Relation of one thing to another, yet it is not
necessary, that each term of the Relation be denominated from it. As a Man may
think of somewhat which does not think, so a Body may be moved to, or from,
another Body which which is not, therefore, it self in Motion, I mean _Relative
Motion_, for other I am not able to conceive.

{#114} As the Place happens to be variously defin'd, the Motion which is related
to it varies. A Man in a Ship may be said to be Quiescent, with relation to the
sides of the Vessel, and yet move, with relation to the Land. Or he may move
Eastward in respect of the one, and Westward in respect of the other. In the
common Affairs of Life, Men never go beyond the Earth, to define the place of
any Body: And what is quiescent in respect of that, is accounted _absolutely_ to
be so. But Philosophers, who have a greater Extent of Thought, and juster
Notions of the System of Things, discover even the Earth it self to be moved. In
order therefore to fix their Notions, they seem to conceive the Corporeal World
as Finite, and the utmost, unmoved Walls or Shell thereof to be the Place,
whereby they estimate True Motions. If we sound our own Conceptions, I believe
we may find all the Absolute Motion we can frame an Idea of, to be at Bottom no
other than Relative Motion thus defined. For as I have already said, absolute
Motion exclusive of all external Relation is incomprehensible: And to this kind
of Relative Motion, all the above-mention'd Properties, Causes, and Effects
ascribed to Absolute Motion will, if I mistake not, be found to agree. As to
what is said of the Centifugal Force, that it does not at all belong to
Circular, Relative Motion: I do not see how this follows from the Experiment
which is brought to prove it. See _Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica_, p. 9. _in Schol. Def._ VIII. For the Water in the Vessel, at that
time wherein it is said to have the greatest Relative, Circular Motion, has, I
think, no Motion at all: As is plain from the foregoing Section.

{#115} For, to denominate a Body _Moved_, it is requisite, first, that it change
its Distance or Situation with regard to some other Body, Secondly, that the
force occasioning that Change be impressed on it. If either of these be wanting,
I do not think that agreeably to the Sense of Mankind, or the Propriety of
Language, a Body can be said to be in Motion. I grant, indeed, that it is
possible for us to think a Body, which we see change its Distance from some
other, to be moved, tho' it have no force impressed on it, (in which Sense there
may be apparent Motion,) but then it is, because the Force causing the change of
Distance, is imagin'd by us to be impress'd on that Body thought to move. Which,
indeed, shews we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in Motion which is not,
but does not prove that, in the common acceptation of _Motion_, a Body is moved
meerly because it changes Distance from another; since as soon as we are
undeceiv'd, and find that the moving Force was not communicated to it, we no
longer hold it to be moved. So on the other hand, when one only Body (the Parts
whereof preserve a given Position between themselves) is imagin'd to Exist; some
there are who think that it can be moved all manner of ways, tho' without any
change of Distance or Situation to any other Bodies; which we shou'd not deny,
if they meant only that it might have an impressed Force, which, upon the bare
creation of other Bodies, wou'd produce a Motion of any certain Quantity and
Determination. But that an actual Motion (distinct from the impressed Force, or
Power productive of Change of Place in case there were Bodies present whereby to
define it) can Exist in such a single Body, I must confess I am not able to
comprehend.

{#116} From what has been said, it follows, that the Philosophic Consideration
of Motion, does not imply the being of an _Absolute Space_, distinct from that
which is perceiv'd by Sense, and related to Bodies: Which that it cannot Exist
without the Mind, is clear upon the same Principles, that demonstrate the like
of all other Objects of Sense. And, perhaps, if we inquire narrowly into the
Matter, we shall find we cannot even frame an Idea of _Pure Space_, exclusive of
all Body. This I must confess, is above my Capacity, as being a most Abstract
Idea. When I excite a Motion in some part of my Body, if it be Free or without
Resistance, I say there is _Space:_ But if I find a Resistance, then I say there
is _Body:_ and in proportion as the Resistance to Motion is lesser or greater, I
say the _Space_ is more or less _Pure_. So that when I speak of pure or empty
Space, it is not to be supposed, that the Word _Space_ stands for an Idea
distinct from, or conceivable without Body and Motion. Tho' indeed, we are apt
to think, every Noun Substantive stands for a distinct Idea, that may be
separated from all others: Which has occasion'd infinite Mistakes. When
therefore supposing all the World to be Annihilated besides my own Body, I say
there still remains _Pure Space:_ Thereby nothing else is meant, but only that I
conceive it possible, for the Limbs of my Body to be mov'd on all sides, without
the least Resistance: But if that too were Annihilated, then there cou'd be no
Motion, and consequently no Space. Some, perhaps, may think the Sense of Seeing
does furnish 'em with the Idea of Pure Space; but it is plain from what we have
elsewhere shewn, that the Ideas of Space and Distance are not obtain'd by that
Sense. See the _Essay concerning Vision_.

{#117} What is here laid down seems to put an end, to all those Disputes, and
Difficulties, that have sprung up amongst the Learned concerning the nature of
_Pure Space_. But the chief Advantage arising from it, is, that we are freed
from that dangerous _Dilemma_, to which several, who have imploy'd their
Thoughts on that Subject, imagine themselves reduced. _viz._ of thinking either
that Real Space is GOD, or else that there is something beside GOD which is
Eternal, Uncreated, Infinite, Indivisible, Immutable, _&c._ Both which may
justly be thought pernicious and absurd Notions. It is certain that not a few
Divines, as well as Philosophers of great Note, have, from the Difficulty they
found in conceiving, either Limits or Annihilation of Space, concluded it must
be _Divine_. And some of late, have set themselves particularly to shew, the
Incommunicable Attributes of GOD agree to it. Which Doctrine, how unworthy
soever it may seem of the Divine Nature, yet, I must confess, I do not See how
we can get clear of it, so long as we adhere to the receiv'd Opinions.

{#118} Hitherto of Natural Philosophy: We come now to make some Inquiry
concerning that other great Branch of Speculative Knowledge, _viz. Mathematics_.
These, how Celebrated soever they may be, for their clearness and certainty of
Demonstration, which is hardly any where else to be found, cannot nevertheless
be suppos'd altogether free from Mistakes, if so be that in their Principles
there lurks some secret Error, which is common to the Professors of those
Sciences with the rest of Mankind. Mathematicians, tho' they deduce their
Theorems from a great Height of Evidence, yet their first Principles are limited
by the consideration of Quantity: And they do not ascend into any Inquiry
concerning those Transcendental Maxims, which influence all the particular
Sciences, each Part whereof, Mathematics not excepted, does consequently
participate of the Errors involved in them. That the Principles laid down by
Mathematicians are true, and their way of Deduction from those Principles clear
and incontestable, we do not deny. But we hold, there may be certain Erroneous
Maxims of greater Extent than the Object of Mathematics, and, for that reason,
not expressly mention'd, tho' tacitly supposed throughout the whole progress of
that Science; and that the ill effects of those secret, unexamin'd Errors are
diffused thrô all the Branches thereof. To be plain, we suspect the
Mathematicians are no less deeply concern'd than other Men, in the Errors
arising from the Doctrine of Abstract, General Ideas, and the Existence of
Objects without the Mind.

{#119} _Arithmetic_ has been thought to have for its Object, Abstract Ideas of
_Number_. Of which to understand the Properties and mutual Habitudes, is
supposed no mean part of Speculative Knowledge. The Opinion of the pure and
intellectual Nature of Numbers in Abstract, has made 'em in esteem with those
Philosophers, who seem to have affected an uncommon Fineness and Elevation of
Thought. It hath set a Price on the most trifling Numerical Speculations, which
in practice are of no use, but serve only for Amusement. And hath heretofore so
far infected the Minds of some, that they have dreamt of mighty _Mysteries_
involved in Numbers, and attempted the Explication of Natural Things by them.
But if we narrowly inquire into our own Thoughts, and consider what has been
premised, we may perhaps entertain a low Opinion of those high Flights and
Abstractions, and look on all Inquiries about Numbers, only as so many
_difficiles nugae_, so far as they are not subservient to practise, and promote
the benefit of Life.

{#120} Unity in Abstract we have before consider'd _vid. Sect._ XIII. from which
and what has been said in the Introduction, it plainly follows, there is not any
such Idea. But Number being defin'd a _Collection of Vnites_, we may conclude
that, if there be no such thing as Unity or Unite in Abstract, there are no
Ideas of Number in Abstract denoted by the Numeral Names and Figures. The
Theories, therefore, in Arithmetic, if they are abstracted from the Names and
Figures, as likewise from all Use and Practice, as well as from the particular
things number'd, can be supposed to have nothing at all for their Object. Hence
we may see, how intirely the Science of Numbers is subordinate to Practice, and
how jejune and trifling it becomes, when consider'd as a matter of meer
Speculation.

{#121} However, since there may be some, who, deluded by the specious Shew of
Discovering Abstracted Verities, waste their time in Arithmetical Theoremes and
Problemes, which have not any Use: It will not be amiss, if we more fully
consider, and expose the Vanity of that Pretence; And this will plainly appear,
by taking a view of Arithmetic in its Infancy, and observing what it was that
originally put Men on the Study of that Science, and to what Scope they directed
it. It is natural to think that at first, Men, for ease of Memory and help of
Computation, made use of Counters, or in writing of Single Stroaks, Points or
the like, each whereof was made to signifie an Unite _i. e._ some one thing of
whatever Kind they had occasion to reckon. Afterwards, they found out the more
compendious ways, of making one Character stand in place of several Stroaks, or
Points. And lastly, the Notation of the _Arabians_ or _Indians_ came into use,
wherein by the repetition of a few Characters or Figures, and varying the
Signification of each Figure according to the the place it obtains, all Numbers
may be most aptly express'd: Which seems to have been done in Imitation of
Language, so that an exact Analogy is observ'd betwixt the Notation by Figures,
and Names, the nine simple Figures answering the nine first numeral Names, and
Places in the former corresponding to Denominations in the latter. And agreeably
to those Conditions of the simple and local Value of Figures, were contrived
Methods of finding from the given Figures or Marks of the Parts, what Figures
and how placed, are proper to denote the whole or _vice versa_. And having found
the sought Figures, the same Rule or Analogy being observ'd throughout, it is
easy to read them into Words; and so the Number becomes perfectly known. For
then the Number of any particular Things is said to be known, when we know the
Name or Figures (with their due arangement) that according to the standing
Analogy belong to them. For these Signs being known, we can by the Operations of
Arithmetic, know the Signs of any Part of the particular Sums signified by them;
and thus computing in Signs, (because of the connexion establish'd betwixt them
and the distinct multitudes of Things, whereof one is taken for an Unite, we may
be able rightly to sum Up, Divide, and Proportion the things Themselves that we
intend to Number.

{#122} In _Arithmetic_, therefore, we regard not the _Things_ but the _Signs_,
which nevertheless are not regarded for their own sake, but because they direct
us how to act with relation to Things, and dispose rightly of them. Now
agreeably to what we have before observ'd, of words in general (_vid. Sect._ XIX
_Introd._) it happens here likewise, that abstract Ideas are thought to be
signified by Numeral Names or Characters, while they do not suggest Ideas of
particular Things to our Minds. I shall not at present, enter into a more
particular Dissertation on this Subject, but only observe that it's evident from
what has been said, those Things which pass for abstract Truths and Theorems
concerning Numbers, are, in reality, conversant about no Object distinct from
particular numerable Things, except only Names and Characters, which originally
came to be consider'd, on no other account but their being _Signs_, or capable
to represent aptly, whatever particular Things Men had need to compute. Whence
it follows, that to study them for their own sake wou'd be just as wise, and to
as good purpose, as if a Man neglecting the true Use or original Intention and
subserviency of Language, shou'd spend his time in impertinent Criticisms upon
Words, or Reasonings and Controversies purely Verbal.

{#123} From Numbers we proceed to speak of _Extension_, which is the Object of
Geometry. The _Infinite_ Divisibility of _Finite_ Extension tho' it is not
expresly laid down, either as an Axiom or Theoreme in the Elements of that
Science, yet, is throughout the same every where suppos'd, and thought to have
so inseparable and essential a Connexion, with the Principles and Demonstrations
in Geometry, that Mathematicians never admit it into Doubt, or make the least
Question of it. And as this Notion is the Source from whence do spring, all
those Amusing Geometrical Paradoxes, which have such a direct Repugnancy to the
plain, common Sense of Mankind, and are admitted with so much Reluctance, into a
Mind not yet debauched by Learning: So is it the principal occasion of all that
nice and extream Subtilty, which renders the Study of _Mathematics_ so very
difficult and tedious. Hence, if we can make it appear, that no Finite Extension
contains innumerable Parts, or is infinitely Divisible, it follows that we shall
at once clear the Science of Geometry, from a great number of Difficulties and
Contradictions which have ever been esteemed a Reproach to Human Reason, and
withal make the Attainment thereof, a business of much less Time and Pains, then
it hitherto has been.

{#124} Every particular, Finite Extension, which may possibly be the Object of
our Thought, is an _Idea_ Existing only in the Mind, and consequently each Part
thereof must be perceiv'd. If, therefore, I cannot perceive innumerable Parts,
in any Finite Extension that I consider, it is certain they are not contained in
it: But it's evident, that I can't distinguish innumerable Parts in any
particular Line, Surface, or Solid, which I either perceive by Sense, or Figure
to my self in my Mind: Wherefore I conclude they are not contained in it.
Nothing can be plainer to me, than that the Extensions I have in View, are no
other than my own Ideas, and it is no less plain, that I cannot resolve any one
of my Ideas, into an infinite Number of other Ideas, that is, that they are not
infinitely Divisible. If by _Finite Extension_ be meant something distinct from
a Finite Idea: I declare I do not know what that is, and so cannot affirm or
deny any thing of it. But if the terms _Extension, Parts, &c._ are taken in
any Sense conceivable _i. e._ for Ideas; then to say, a Finite Quantity or
Extension consists of Parts infinite in Number, is so manifest and glaring a
Contradiction, that every one at first sight acknowledges it to be so. And it's
impossible, it shou'd ever gain the assent of any reasonable Creature, who is
not brought to it by gentle and slow Degrees, as a Pagan Convert to the belief
of _Transubstantiation_. Ancient and rooted Prejudices do often pass into
Principles: And those Propositions which once obtain the force and credit of a
_Principle_, are not only themselves, but likewise whatever's deducible from
them, thought privileg'd from all Examination. And there's no Absurdity so
gross, which, by this means, the Mind of Man may not be prepared to swallow.

{#125} He whose Understanding is prepossest with the Doctrine of Abstract,
general Ideas, may be easily perswaded, that (whatever be thought of the Ideas
of Sense,) Extension in _Abstract_ is infinitely Divisible. And any one, who
thinks the Objects of Sense Exist without the Mind, will not stick to affirm, a
Line but an Inch long may contain innumerable Parts, really Existing, though too
small to be discern'd. These Errors are grafted, as well in the Minds of
_Geometricians_, as of other Men, and have a like influence on their Reasonings;
and it were no difficult thing, to shew how the Arguments from Geometry made use
of to support the infinite divisibility of Extension, are bottom'd on them. But
this, if it be thought necessary, we may hereafter find a proper place to treat
of in a particular manner. At present we shall only observe in general, whence
it is the Mathematicians are all so fond and tenacious of that Doctrine.

{#126} It has been observ'd in another place, that the Theorems and
Demonstrations in Geometry are conversant about Universal Ideas. _vid. Sect._
XV. _Introd._ Where it is explain'd in what Sense this ought to be understood,
namely, the particular Lines and Figures included in the Diagram, are supposed
to stand for innumerable Others of different Sizes, or, in other Words, the
Geometer considers them abstracting from their Magnitude, which does not imply,
that he forms an Abstract Idea, but only that he cares not what the particular
Magnitude is, whether Great or Small, but looks on that as a thing indifferent
to the Demonstration: Hence it follows, that a Line in the Scheme, but an Inch
long, must be spoken of, as tho' it contain'd ten-thousand Parts, since it is
regarded, not in it self, but as it is universal, and it is universal only in
its Signification, whereby it represents innumerable Lines greater than it self,
in which may be distinguish'd ten-thousand Parts or more, tho' there may not in
it. After this manner, the properties of the Lines signified are (by a very
usual Figure) transfer'd to the Sign, and thence, thro' Mistake, thought to
appertain to it consider'd in its own nature.

{#127} Because there is no number of Parts so great, but its possible there may
be a Line containing more, the Inch-line is said to contain Parts more than any
assignable Number; which is true, not of the Inch taken absolutely, but only for
the things signified by it. But Men not retaining that Distinction in their
Thoughts, slide into a belief, that the small particular Line described on Paper
contains in it self Parts innumerable. There is no such thing as the
ten-thousandth Part of an _Inch_; but there is of a _Mile_ or _Diameter of the
Earth_, which may be signified by that Inch. When therefore, I Delineate a
Triangle on Paper, and take one side not above an Inch, for Example, in length
to be the _Radius:_ This I consider as divided into 10000 or 100000 Parts, or
more. For tho' the ten-thousandth Part of that Line, consider'd in it self, is
nothing at all, and consequently may be neglected without any Error or
Inconveniency; yet these described Lines being only Marks, standing for greater
Quantities, whereof, it may be, the ten-thousandth Part is very considerable, it
follows that, to prevent notable Errors in Practice, the _Radius_ must be taken
of 10000 Parts, or more.

{#128} From what has been said the reason is plain why, to the end any Theorem
become universal in its Use, its necessary we speak of the Lines described on
Paper, as tho' they contain'd Parts which really they do not. In doing of which,
if we examine the matter throughly, we shall, perhaps, discover that we cannot
conceive an Inch it self as consisting of, or being divisible into, a thousand
Parts, but only some other Line which is far greater than an Inch, and
represented by it. And that when we say a Line is _infinitely Divisible_. We
mean (if we mean any thing) a Line which is _infinitely Great_. What we have
here observ'd seems to be the chief Cause, why, to suppose the infinite
divisibility of Finite Extension, has been thought necessary in Geometry.

{#129} The several Absurdities and Contradictions which flow'd from this false
Principle might, one wou'd think, have been esteem'd so many Demonstrations
against it. But, by I know not what _Logic_, it is held that Proofs _a
posteriori_ are not to be admitted, against Propositions relating to Infinity.
As tho', it were not impossible, even for an Infinite Mind, to reconcile
Contradictions. Or as if any thing Absurd and Repugnant cou'd have a necessary
connexion with Truth, or flow from it. But whoever considers the weakness of
this Pretence, will think it was contrived on purpose, to humour the Laziness of
the Mind, which had rather acquiesce in an indolent Scepticism, than be at the
Pains, to go through with a severe Examination of those Principles it has ever
embraced for true.

{#130} Of late the Speculations about Infinites have run so high, and grown to
such strange Notions, as have occasion'd no small Scruples and Disputes, among
the Geometers of the present Age. Some there are of great Note, who not content
with holding, that Finite Lines may be divided into an Infinite number of Parts,
do yet farther maintain, that each of those Infinitesimals is it self
subdivisible, into an infinity of other Parts, or Infinitesimals of a second
Order, and so on _ad~infinitum_. These, I say, assert, there are Infinitesimals
of infinitesimals of Infinitesimals, _&c._ without ever coming to an end. So
that, according to them an Inch does not barely contain an infinite number of
Parts, but an Infinity of an Infinity of an Infinity _ad~infinitum_ of Parts.
Others there be who hold, all orders of Infinitesimals below the first to be
nothing at all, thinking it, with good reason, Absurd, to imagine there is any
positive Quantity or Part of Extension, which, tho' multiplyed Infinitely, can
never equal the smallest given Extension. And yet on the other hand, it seems no
less Absurd, to think the Square, Cube, or other Power of a positive, real Root,
shou'd it self be nothing at all; which they, who hold Infinitesimals of the
first Order, denying all of the subsequent Orders, are obliged to maintain.

{#131} Have we not, therefore, reason to conclude, they are _both_ in the wrong,
and that there is in effect no such thing as Parts infinitely Small, or an
infinite number of Parts contain'd in any Finite Quantity? But you'll say, that
if this Doctrine obtains, it will follow, the very Foundations of Geometry are
destroy'd: And those Great Men who, have raised that Science to so astonishing
an Height, have been all the while building a Castle in the Air. To this it may
be Replied, that whatever is useful in Geometry, and promotes the benefit of
Human Life, does still remain firm and unshaken on our Principles. That Science
consider'd as Practical, will rather rereive Advantage, than any Prejudice from
what has been said. But to set this in a due Light, and shew how Lines and
Figures may be measur'd, and their Properties investigated, without supposing
Finite Extension to be infinitely Divisible, may be the proper Business of
another place. For the rest, tho' it shou'd follow that some of the more
intricate and subtile Parts of _Speculative Mathematics_ may be pared of,
without any prejudice to Truth; yet I do not see, what Damage will be thence
derived to Mankind. On the contrary, I think it were highly to be wish'd, that
Men of the greatest Abilities and most obstinate Application, wou'd draw off
their Thoughts from those Amusements, and imploy them in the study of such
Things, as lie nearer the concerns of Life, or have a more direct Influence on
the Manners.

{#132} If it be said that several Theorems undoubtedly true, are discover'd by
methods in which Infinitesimals are made use of, which cou'd never have been, if
their Existence included a contradiction in it. I answer, that upon a thorough
Examination it will not be found, that in any Instance it is necessary to make
use of or conceive Infinitesimal Parts of finite Lines, or even Quantities less
than the _Minimum Sensibile:_ Nay it will be evident this is never done, it
being impossible. And whatever Mathematicians may think of _Fluxions_ or the
_Differential Calculus_ and the like, a little Reflexion will shew them, that in
working by those Methods, they do not conceive or imagine Lines or Surfaces less
than what are perceivable to Sense. They may, indeed, call those little and
almost Insensible Quantities _Infinitesimals_ or _Infinitesimals of
Infinitesimals_, if they please: But at Bottom this is all, they being in truth
Finite, nor does the Solution of Problemes require the supposing any other. But
this will be more clearly made out hereafter.

{#133} By what we have hitherto said, 'tis plain that very numerous and and
important Errors have taken their Rise, from those false Principles which were
impugned in the foregoing Parts of this Treatise. And the Opposites of those
erroneous Tenents, at the same time, appear to be most fruitful Principles, from
whence do flow innumerable Consequences highly advantagious, to true Philosophy
as well as to Religion. Particularly, _Matter_ or _the Absolute Existence of
Corporeal Objects_, have been shewn to be that wherein the most avow'd and
pernicious Enemies of all Knowledge, whether Human or Divine, have ever placed
their chief Strength and Confidence. And surely, if by distinguishing the real
Existence of unthinking Things from their being perceiv'd, and allowing them a
Subsistence of their own out of the Minds of Spirits, no one thing is explained
in Nature, but, on the contrary, a great many inexplicable Difficulties arise:
If the Supposition of Matter is barely precarious, as not being grounded on so
much as one single Reason: If its Consequences cannot endure the light of
Examination and free Inquiry, but skreen themselves under the dark and general
pretence of _Infinites being Incomprehensible:_ If withal the Removal of this
_Matter_ be not attended with the least evil Consequence, if it be not even
missed in the World, but every thing as well, nay much easier conceiv'd without
it: If in fine, both _Sceptics_ and _Atheists_ are for ever silenced upon
supposing only Spirits and Ideas, and this Scheme of Things is perfectly
agreeable both to _Reason_ and _Religion:_ Methinks we may expect it shou'd be
admitted and firmly embraced, tho' it were propos'd only as an _Hypothesis_, and
the Existence of Matter had been allow'd possible, which yet, I think, we have
evidently demonstrated that it is not.

{#134} True it is, that in consequence of the foregoing Principles, several
Disputes and Speculations, which are esteem'd no mean Parts of Learning, are
rejected as useless, and in effect conversant about nothing at all. But how
great a Prejudice soever against our Notions, this may give to those who have
already been deeply Engag'd, and made large Advances in Studies of that Nature:
Yet by Others, we hope it will not be thought any just ground of Dislike, to the
Principles and Tenents herein laid down, that they abridge the labour of Study,
and make Human Sciences far more Clear, Compendious, and Attainable than they
were before.

{#135} Having dispatch'd what we intended to say concerning the Knowledge of
_Ideas_, the Method we propos'd leads us, in the next place, to treat of
_Spirits:_ With regard to which, perhaps, Human Knowledge is not so deficient as
is vulgarly imagined. The great Reason that's assign'd, for our being thought
Ignorant of the nature of Spirits, is, our not having an Idea of it. But surely
it ought not to be look'd on as a defect in a Human Understanding, that it does
not perceive the Idea of _Spirit_, if it is manifestly impossible there shou'd
be any such _Idea_. And this if I mistake not, has been demonstrated in _Sect_
XXVII to which I shall here add that a Spirit has been shewn to be the only
Substance, or Support wherein Unthinking Beings or Ideas can Exist: But that
this _Substance_ which supports or perceives Ideas, shou'd it self be an _Idea_
or like an _Idea_ is evidently Absurd.

{#136} It will perhaps be said, that, we want a Sense (as some have imagin'd)
proper to know Substances withal, which if we had, we might know our own Soul,
as we do a Triangle. To this I answer, that in case we had a new Sense bestow'd
upon us, we cou'd only receive thereby some new Sensations or Ideas of Sense.
But, I believe, no Body will say, that what he means by the terms _Soul_ and
_Substance_, is only some particular sort of Idea or Sensation. We may therefore
infer, that, all things duly consider'd, it is not more reasonable to think our
Faculties defective, in that they do not furnish us with an Idea of Spirit, or
Active, Thinking Substance, than it wou'd be if we shou'd blame them for not
being able to comprehend a _round Square_.

{#137} From the opinion that Spirits are to be known after the manner of an Idea
or Sensation, have risen many absurd and heterodox Tenents, and much Scepticism
about the Nature of the Soul. 'Tis even probable, that this Opinion may have
produced a doubt in some, whether they had any Soul at all distinct from their
Body, since upon inquiry they cou'd not find they had an Idea of it. That an
_Idea_ which is Inactive, and the Existence whereof consists in being Perceiv'd,
shou'd be the Image or Likeness of an Agent subsisting by it self, seems to need
no other Refutation, than barely attending to what is meant by those Words. But,
perhaps, you'll say, that tho' an _Idea_ cannot resemble a _Spirit_, in its
Thinking, Acting, or Subsisting by it self, yet it may in some other respects:
And it is not necessary, that an Idea or Image be in all respects like the
Original.

{#138} I answer, If it does not in those mention'd, it is impossible it shou'd
represent it in any other thing. Do but leave out the Power of Willing,
Thinking, and Perceiving Ideas, and there remains nothing else wherein the Idea
can be like a Spirit. For by the Word _Spirit_ we mean only that which Thinks,
Wills, and Perceives, this, and this alone, constitutes the Signification of
that Term. If, therefore, it is impossible that any degree of those Powers,
shou'd be represented in an Idea or Notion, 'tis evident there can be no Idea or
Notion of a Spirit.

{#139} But it will be objected, that if there is no Idea signified by the terms
_Soul, Spirit_, and _Substance_, they are wholly insignificant, or have no
meaning in 'em. I answer those Words do mean or signify a real Thing, which is
neither an Idea nor like an Idea, but that which perceives Ideas, and Wills, and
Reasons about them. What I am my self, that which I denote by the term I, is the
same with what is meant by _Soul_, or _Spiritual Substance_. But if I shou'd
say, that I was nothing, or that I was an Idea or Notion, nothing cou'd be more
evidently Absurd than either of these Propositions. You'll perhaps, insist, that
this is only Quarrelling at a Word, and that since the immediate significations
of other Names, are by common consent called _Ideas_, no reason can be assign'd,
why that which is signified by the name _Spirit_ or _Soul_ may not partake in
the same Appellation. I answer, all the Unthinking Objects of the Mind agree, in
that they are intirely Passive, and their Existence consists only in being
perceiv'd: Whereas a Soul or Spirit is an active being, whose Existence consists
not in Being perceiv'd, but in perceiving Ideas and Thinking. It is, therefore,
necessary in order to prevent Equivocation and confounding Natures perfectly
disagreeing and unlike, that we distinguish between _Spirit_ and _Idea. Vid.
Sect._ XXVII.

{#140} In a large Sense, indeed, we may be said to have an Idea of _Spirit_,
that is, we understand the meaning of the Word otherwise we cou'd not affirm or
deny any thing of it. Moreover, as we conceive the Ideas that are in the Minds
of other Spirits, by means of our own, which we suppose to be Resemblances of
them. So we know other Spirits by means of our own Soul, which, in that Sense,
is the Image or Idea of them, it having a like respect to other Spirits, that
Blueness or Heat by me perceiv'd has to those Ideas perceiv'd by another.

{#141} The _natural Immortality of the Soul_ is a necessary Consequence of the
foregoing Doctrine. But before we attempt to prove this, 'tis fit that we
explain the meaning of that Tenent. It must not be supposed, that they who
assert the natural Immortality of the Soul are of opinion, that, it is
absolutely incapable of Annihilation, even by the infinite power of the CREATOR,
who first gave it Being. But only that it is not liable to be broken, or
dissolv'd, by the ordinary Laws of Nature or Motion. They indeed, who hold the
Soul of Man to be only a thin, vital Flame, or System of animal Spirits, make it
Perishing and Corruptible as the Body, since there is nothing more easily
dissipated than such a Being, which it is naturally impossible shou'd survive
the Ruin of the Tabernacle, wherein it is inclos'd. And this Notion has been
greedily embraced, and cherish'd by the worst Part of Mankind, as the most
effectual Antidote against all Impressions of Vertue and Religion. But it has
been made evident, that Bodies, of what frame or Texture soever, are barely
passive Ideas in the Mind, which is more distant and heterogeneous from them,
than Light is from Darkness. We have shewn that the Soul is Indivisible,
Incorporeal, Unextended, and it is consequently Incorruptible. Nothing can be
plainer, than that the Motions, Changes, Decays, and Dissolutions which we
hourly see befal natural Bodies (and which is what we mean by the _course of
Nature_) cannot possibly affect an Active, Simple, Uncompounded Substance: Such
a being, therefore, is Indissoluble by the force of Nature, that is to say, _the
Soul of Man is naturally Immortal_.

{#142} After what has been said, 'tis, I suppose, plain that our Souls are not
to be known in the same manner as senseless, inactive Objects, or by way of
_Idea. Spirits_ and _Ideas_ are things so wholly different, that when we say,
_they Exist, they are Known_, or the like, these Words must not be thought to
signifie any thing common to both Natures. There is nothing alike or common in
them: And to expect, that by any multiplication or enlargement of our Faculties,
we may be enabled to know a Spirit as we do a Triangle, seems as Absurd as if we
shou'd hope to _see a Sound_. This is inculcated because I imagine it may be of
Moment, towards clearing several important Questions, and preventing some very
dangerous Errors concerning the Nature of the Soul.

{#143} It will not be amiss to add, that the Doctrine of _Abstract Ideas_ has
had no small share, in rendering those Sciences Intricate and obscure, which are
particularly conversant about Spiritual Things. Men have imagin'd they cou'd
frame abstract Notions, of the Powers and Acts of the Mind, and consider them
prescinded, as well from the Mind or Spirit it self, as from their respective
Objects and Effects. Hence a great number of dark and ambiguous Terms, presum'd
to stand for abstract Notions, have been introduced into Metaphysics and
Morality, and from these have grown Infinite Distractions and Disputes amongst
the Learned.

{#144} But nothing seems more to have contributed, towards engaging Men in
Controversies and Mistakes, with regard to the Nature and Operations of the
Mind, than the being used to speak of those things, in Terms borrow'd from
sensible Ideas. For Example, The Will is termed the _Motion_ of the Soul: This
infuses a Belief, that the Mind of Man is as a Ball in Motion, impell'd and
determin'd by the Objects of Sense, as necessarily as that is by the Stroak of a
Racket. Hence arise endless Scruples and Errors of dangerous Consequence in
Morality. All which, I doubt not, may be cleared, and Truth appear Plain,
Uniform, and Consistent, cou'd but Philosophers be prevail'd on, to depart from
some receiv'd prejudices and modes of Speech, and retiring into themselves
attentively consider their own meaning. But the Difficulties arising on this
Head, demand a more particular Disquisition, than suits with the Design of this
Treatise.

{#145} From what has been said, 'tis plain, that we cannot know the Existence of
other Spirits, otherwise than by their Operations, or the Ideas by them excited
in us. I perceive several Motions, Changes, and Combinations of Ideas, that
inform me there are certain particular Agents, like my self, which accompany
them, and concur in their Production. Hence, the Knowledge I have of other
Spirits is not immediate, as is the Knowledge of my Ideas, but depending on the
Intervention of Ideas, by me refer'd to Agents or Spirits distinct from my self,
as Effects or concomitant Signs.

{#146} But tho' there be some things which convince us, Human Agents are
concern'd in producing them; yet it is evident to every one, that those things
which are call'd the works of Nature, _i. e._ the far greater part of the Ideas
or Sensations perceived by us, are not produced by, or dependent on, the Wills
of Men. There is therefore some other Spirit that causes them, since it is
repugnant that they shou'd subsist by themselves. _See Sect._ XXIX. But if we
attentively consider the constant Regularity, Order, and Concatenation of
Natural Things, the surprising Magnificence, Beauty and Perfection of the
larger, and the Exquisite Contrivance of the smaller Parts of the Creation,
together with the exact Harmony and Correspondence of the whole, but, above all,
the never enough admir'd Laws of Pain and Pleasure, and the Instincts or natural
Inclinations, Appetites, and Passions of Animals, I say if we consider all these
things, and at the same time attend to the meaning and import of the Attributes
One, Eternal, Infinitely Wise, Good and Perfect, we shall clearly perceive that
they belong to the aforesaid Spirit, _who works all in all_, and _by whom all
things consist_.

{#147} Hence it is evident, that GOD, is known as certainly and immediately as
any other Mind or Spirit whatsoever, distinct from our selves. We may even
assert, that the Existence of GOD is far more evidently perceiv'd than the
Existence of Men; because the Effects of Nature are infinitely more numerous and
considerable, than those ascribed to Human Agents. There is not any one Mark
that denotes a Man, or Effect produced by him, which does not more strongly
evince the Being of that Spirit, who is the _Author of Nature_. For it is
evident that in affecting other Persons, the will of Man has no other Object,
than barely the Motion of the Limbs of his Body, but that such a Motion shou'd
be attended by, or excite, any Idea in the Mind of another, depends wholly on
the Will of the CREATOR. He alone it is who, _upholding all things by the word
of his Power_, maintains that Intercourse between Spirits, whereby they are able
to perceive the Existence of each other. And yet this pure and clear Light which
enlightens every one, is it self invisible to the greatest part of Mankind.

{#148} \S 148 It seems to be a general Pretence of the Unthinking Herd, that they
cannot see GOD. Cou'd we but see him, say they, as we see a Man, we shou'd
believe that he is, and believing obey his Commands. But alas we need only open
our Eyes to see the Sovereign Lord of all Things, with a more full and clear
view than we do any one of our Fellow-Creatures. Not that I imagine, we see GOD
(as some will have it) by a direct and immediate View, or see Corporeal Things,
not by themselves but, by seeing that which represents them in the Essence of
GOD, which Doctrine is, I must confess, to me Incomprehensible. But I shall
explain my Meaning. A Human Spirit or Person is not perceiv'd by Sense, as not
being an Idea; when therefore we see the Colour, Size, Figure, and Motions of a
Man, we perceive only certain Sensations or Ideas excited in our own Minds: And
these, being exhibited to our view in sundry, distinct Collections serve to mark
out unto us the Existence of Finite, and Created Spirits like our selves. Hence
'tis plain, we do not see a Man, if by _Man_ is meant that which Lives, Moves,
Perceives, and Thinks as we do: But only such a certain Collection of Ideas, as
directs us to think there is a distinct Principle of Thought and Motion, like to
our selves, accompanying and represented by it. And after the same manner we see
GOD; all the difference is, that, whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage
of Ideas denotes a particular Human Mind, whithersoever we direct our view, we
do at all times and in all places, perceive manifest Tokens of the Divinity:
Every thing we See, Hear, Feel or any wise perceive by Sense, being a Sign or
Effect of the Power of GOD: as is our Perception of those very Motions, which
are produced by Men.

{#149} 'Tis therefore plain, that nothing can be more evident to any one that's
capable of the least Reflexion, than the Existence of GOD, or a Spirit who is
intimately present to our Minds, producing in them all that variety of Ideas or
Sensations, which continually affect us, on whom we have an absolute and intire
Dependence, in short _in whom we Live, and Move, and have our Being_. That the
Discovery of this great Truth which lies so near and obvious to the Mind, shou'd
be attain'd to by the Reason of so very few, is a sad instance of the Stupidity
and Inattention of Men, who, though they are Surrounded with such clear
manifestations of the Deity, are yet so little affected by them, that they seem,
as it were, blinded with excess of Light.

{#150} But you'll say has Nature no share in the Production of Natural Things,
and must they be all ascrib'd to the immediate and sole Operation of GOD? I
answer, if by _Nature_ is meant only the visible _Series_ of Effects, or
Sensations imprinted on our Minds, according to certain fixt and general Laws:
Then 'tis plain, that Nature taken in this Sense cannot produce any thing at
all. But if by _Nature_ is meant some Being distinct from GOD, as well as from
the Laws of Nature, and things perceiv'd by Sense, I must confess, that Word is
to me an empty Sound, without any intelligible Meaning annexed to it. Nature, in
this Acceptation, is a vain _Chimera_ introduced by those Heathens, who had not
just Notions of the Omnipresence and infinite Perfection of GOD. But it is more
unaccountable, that it shou'd be receiv'd among _Christians_ professing belief
in the Holy Scriptures, which constantly ascribe those Effects to the immediate
Hand of GOD, that Heathen Philosophers are wont to impute to _Nature. The LORD,
he causeth the Vapours to ascend; he maketh Lightnings with Rain; he bringeth
forth the Wind out of his Treasures._ Jerem. Chap. 10. v. 13. _He turneth the
shadow of Death into the Morning, and maketh the Day dark with Night._ Amos
Chap. 5. v. 8. _He visiteth the Earth, and maketh it soft with Showers: He
blesseth the Springing thereof, and crowneth the Year with his Goodness; so that
the Pastures are cloathed with Flocks, and the Valleys are cover'd over with
Corn._ See Psal. 65. But notwithstanding that this is the constant Language of
Scripture; yet we have I know not what Aversion from believing, that GOD
concerns himself so nearly in our Affairs. Fain wou'd we suppose him at a great
distance off, and substitute some blind, unthinking Deputy in his stead, though
(if we may believe Saint _Paul) he be not far from every one of us_.

{#151} It will, I doubt not, be objected, that the slow, gradual and round-about
Methods observ'd in the Production of Natural Things, do not seem to have for
their Cause the immediate Hand of an _Almighty Agent_. Besides, Monsters,
untimely Births, Fruits blasted in the Blossom, Rains falling in desert Places,
Miseries incident to Human Life, and the like, are so many arguments that the
whole frame of Nature, is not immediately actuated and superintended by a Spirit
of infinite Wisdom and Goodness. But the Answer to this Objection is in a good
measure plain from _Sect._ LXII, it being visible, that the aforesaid Methods of
Nature are absolutely necessary, in order to working by the most simple and
general Rules, and after a steady and consistent Manner; which argues both the
_Wisdom_ and _Goodness_ of GOD. For, it doth hence follow, that the Finger of
GOD is not so conspicuous to the resolv'd and careless Sinner, which gives him
an oppertunity to harden in his Impiety, and grow ripe for Vengeance. _vid.
Sect._ LVII. Such is the Artificial Contrivance of this mighty Machine of
Nature, that whilst its Motions and various Phaenomena strike on our Senses, the
Hand which actuates the whole is it self unperceivable to Men of Flesh and
Blood. _Verily_ (saith the Prophet) _thou art a GOD that hidest thy self._
Isaiah Chap. 45. ver. 15. But though the Lord conceal himself from the Eyes of
the _Sensual_ and _Lazy_, who will not be at the least expence of Thought; yet
to an unbiassed and attentive Mind, nothing can be more plainly legible, than
the intimate Presence of an _All-wise Spirit_, who Fashions, Regulates, and
Sustains the whole System of Beings. Secondly, It is clear from what we have
elsewhere observ'd, that the Operating according to general and stated Laws, is
so necessary for our Guidance in the affairs of Life, and letting us into the
Secret of Nature, that without it, all Reach and Compass of Thought, all Human
Sagacity and Design cou'd serve to no manner of Purpose: It were even
impossible, there shou'd be any such Faculties or Powers in the Mind, _vid.
Sect._ XXXI. Which one Consideration abundantly out-ballances whatever
particular Inconveniences may thence arise.

{#152} But we shou'd further consider, that the very Blemishes and Defects of
Nature are not without their Use, in that they make an agreeable sort of
Variety, and augment the Beauty of the rest of the Creation, as Shades in a
Picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlighten'd Parts. We wou'd
likewise do well to examine, whether our taxing the Waste of Seeds and Embryo's,
and accidental Destruction of Plants and Animals, before they come to full
Maturity, as an Imprudence in the Author of Nature, be not the effect of
Prejudice, contracted by our Familiarity with impotent and saving Mortals. In
_Man_, indeed, a thrifty Management of those Things, which he cannot procure
without much Pains and Industry, may be esteem'd _Wisdom_. But we must not
imagine, that the inexplicably fine Machine of an Animal or Vegetable, costs the
Great CREATOR any more Pains or Trouble in its Production, than a Pebble does:
nothing being more evident, than that an Omnipotent Spirit, can indifferently
produce every thing, by a meer _Fiat_ or act of his Will. Hence it is plain,
that the splendid Profusion of Natural Things shou'd not be interpreted,
Weakness or Prodigality in the Agent who produces them, but rather be look'd on
as an Argument of the Riches of his Power.

{#153} As for the mixture of Pain or Uneasiness which is in the World, pursuant
to the General Laws of Nature, and the Actions of Finite, Imperfect Spirits;
This, in the State we are in at present, is indispensibly necessary to our
Well-being. But our Prospects are too narrow: We take, for Instance, the Idea of
some one particular Pain into our Thoughts, and account it _Evil_; whereas if we
enlarge our View, so as to comprehend the various Ends, Connexions, and
Dependencies of things, on what Occasions and in what Proportions, we are
affected with Pain and Pleasure, the Nature of Human Freedom, and the Design
with which we are put into the World; we shall be forced to acknowledge that
those particular Things, which consider'd in themselves appear to be _Evil_,
have the Nature of _Good_, when consider'd as link'd with the whole System of
Beings.

{#154} From what has been said it will be manifest to any Considering Person,
that it's meerly for want of attention and comprehensiveness of Mind that there
are any Favourers of _Atheism_ or the _Manichaean Heresie_ to be found. Little
and unreflecting Souls may, indeed, Burlesque the Works of Providence, the
Beauty and Order whereof they have not Capacity, or will not be at the Pains, to
comprehend. But those who are Masters of any justness and extent of Thought and
are withal used to reflect, can never sufficiently admire the Divine Traces of
Wisdom and Goodness, that shine throughout the Oeconomy of Nature. But what
Truth is there which glares so strongly on the Mind, that by an aversion of
Thought, a wilful shutting of the Eyes, we may not escape seeing it, at least
with a full and direct view? Is it therefore to be wonder'd at, if the
generality of Men, who are ever intent on Business or Pleasure, and little used
to fix or open the Eye of their Mind, shou'd not have all that Conviction and
Evidence of the Being of GOD, which might be expected in Reasonable Creatures?

{#155} We shou'd rather admire, that Men can be found so Stupid as to neglect,
than that neglecting they shou'd be unconvinced of, such an evident and
momentous Truth. And yet it is to be fear'd that too mamy of Parts and Leisure,
who live in Christian Countries, are meerly thrô a supine and dreadful
Negligence sunk into a sort of _Demy-Atheism_. They can't say there is not a
GOD, but neither are they convinced that there is. For what else can it be but
some lurking Infidelity, some secret misgivings of Mind, with regard to the
Existence and Attributes of GOD, which permits Sinners to grow and harden in
Impiety? Since it is downright impossible, that a Soul pierced and enlighten'd
with a thorough Sense of the Omnipresence, Holiness, and Justice of that
_Almighty Spirit_, shou'd persist in a remorsless Violation of his Laws. We
ought, therefore, earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important Points;
that so we may attain Conviction without all Scruple, _that the Eyes of the LORD
are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good; that he is with us and
keepeth us in all places whither we go, and giveth us Bread to eat and Raiment
to put on_; that he is present and conscious to our innermost Thoughts; in fine,
that we have a most absolute and immediate Dependence on Him. A clear View of
which great Truths cannot chuse but fill our Hearts, with an awful
Circumspection and holy Fear, which is the strongest Incentive to _Vertue_, and
the best Guard against _Vice_.

{#156} For after all, what deserves the first place in our Studies, is the
Consideration of _GOD_, and our _Duty_; which to promote as it was the the main
drift and design of my Labours, so shall I esteem them altogether useless and
ineffectual, if, by what I have said I cannot inspire my Readers with a pious
Sense of the Presence of GOD: And having shewn the Falseness or Vanity of those
barren Speculations, which make the chief Employment of Learned Men, the better
dispose them to reverence and embrace the Salutary Truths of the GOSPEL, which
to Know and to Practise, is the highest Perfection of Human Nature.
