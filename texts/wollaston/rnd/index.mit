  The first edition of [The Religion of Nature Delineated] was published in
  1722, but was (according to the advertisement to the second 1724  edition)
  “transcribed for the press hastily”, and contained “many _errata_ and
  mistakes”. Our copytext is therefore this second edition, the last to be
  printed in Wollaston’s lifetime. The text here derives from Stanley Tweyman’s
  edition (Delmar, New York\: Scholars’ Facsimiles and Reprints).
