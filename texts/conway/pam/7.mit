_\S. 1. That every Body may be turned into a Spirit, and a Spirit into a
Body; because the distinction between Body and Spirit is only in _Modo,_ not in
_Essentia:_ The reason hereof is taken, first, from the Order of Things
abovesaid, which consists only in Three. And that the worst of Creatures; yea,
the most cursed Devils, after many and long-continued Torments, shall at length
return to a State of Goodness. Moreover, that all this hardness and grossness of
Bodies, came from a certain Fall, which therefore shall in time return to a
state of softness and subtilty. \S. 2. The Second Reason is drawn from the Divine
Attributes, whereof some are communicable to his Creatures. \S. 3. The Third
Reason, is drawn from the love which the Spirits have to their Bodies. \S. 4.
That to be penetrable and indiscerpible is as truly attributed to Bodies, as to
Spirits; and to be impenetrable and discerpible agrees as well to Spirits as
to Bodies; for that the difference is Gradual and not Essential; And that no
Creature, or Created Spirit, can be intimately present in any Creature, because
Intrinsick Presence only pertains to God and Christ; and therefore that
Philosophical Penetration of Created Spirits, in regard of Bodies, is a mere
Scholastick Fiction._

{#i} NOW that I may more clearly demonstrate, that every Body is a certain
Spirit or Life in its own Nature, and that the same is a certain intelligent
Principle, having knowledge, Sense, Love, Desire, Joy, and Grief; as it is this
or that way affected; and by consequence hath Activity and Motion, _per se;_ so
that it can remove it self whithersoever it desires to be; I say, in its own
Nature, wherein it was originally created, and as it shall be again, when it
shall be reduced to its primitive State, and delivered from that Confusion and
Vanity, to which it is subject by reason of Sin. I shall produce these following
Reasons. (Of the Nature of Matter and Spirit, more may be seen in _Kabbal,
denud._ Tom. 1. Part 2. p. 308. unto. p. 312. and Tom. 2. Treatise ult. pag. 6.
28, 29, 32.)

{#1} \S. 1. THE first hereof shall be from the Order of Things, before-mentioned,
which I have already proved to be but Three; to wit, God the Supreme or
Chiefest, Christ the _Medium_ or Middle, and the Creature the lowest in Order;
which Creature is but one Essence or Substance, as to Nature or Essence, as is
above demonstrated, so that it only differs _secundum modos existendi;_ or,
_according to the manners of existence;_ among which one is Corporiety; whereof
also there are many degrees; so that a Thing may more or less approach to, or
recede from the State and Condition of a Body or a Spirit; but because a Spirit
(between these two) is more excellent in the Natural Order of Things, and by how
much the more a Creature is a Spirit, (if at least wise it doth not any
otherwise degenerate) so much the nearer it approaches to God, who is the
chiefest Spirit. Hence a Body may always be more and more Spiritual, _ad
infinitum;_ because God who is the First and Supreme Spirit is Infinite, and
doth not nor cannot partake of the least Corporiety; whence such is the Nature
of a Creature, unless it degenerates, that it always draws nearer and nearer
unto God in likeness: But because there is no Being, which is every way contrary
to God, _(Viz._ there is no Being, which is infinitely and unchangeably Evil, as
God is infinitely and unchangeably Good; nothing infinitely Dark, as God is
infinitely Light; nor any thing infinitely a Body, having nothing of Spirit, as
God is infinitely a Spirit, having nothing of Body;) hence it is manifest that
no Creature can become more and more a Body, _ad infinitum,_ although the same
may become more and more a Spirit, _ad infinitum;_ and nothing can become
infinitely more dark, though it may become infinitely more light: By the same
reason nothing can be Evil _ad infinitum,_ although it may become more and more
Good _ad infinitum:_ And so indeed, in the very Nature of Things, there are
limits or bounds to Evil; but none unto Good. And after the same manner, every
degree of Sin or Evil hath its Punishment, Grief, and Chastisement annexed to
it, in the very Nature of the Thing, by which the Evil is again changed into
Good; which Punishment or Correction, though it be not presently perceived of
the Creature, when it Sins, yet is reserved in those very Sins which the same
committeth, and in its due time will appear; and then every Sin will have its
Punishment, and so the Pain and Chastisement will be felt of the Creature, and
by that the Creature will be again restored unto its former State of Goodness,
in which it was created, and from which it cannot fall or slide any more;
because by its great Chastisement it hath acquired a greater Strength and
Perfection; and so is ascended so far above that indifferency of Will, which
before it had to Good or Evil, that it Wills only that which is Good, neither is
any more capable to Will any Evil. See _Kabbal. denud._ Tom. 2. Tract. ult. p.
61. \S. 9. p. 69. \S. 21. and 70. \S. 5. & _ibid._ Tract. 2. p. 157.

{#2} And hence may be inferred, that all the Creatures of God, which heretofore
degenerated and fell from their primitive Goodness, must after certain periods
be converted and restored, not only to as good, but unto a better State than
that was in which they were created: For Divine Operation cannot cease: And
hence it is the Nature of every Creature to be still in Motion, and always to
change either from Good to Good, or from Good into Evil, or from Evil again into
Good; and because it cannot proceed infinitely to Evil, for that there is no
Infinite Example thereof, hence it must necessarily return or slide into Eternal
Silence, which is contrary to the Nature of it. But if it be said, it goes into
Eternal Torments, I Answer, If by Eternal thou meanest an Infiniteness of Ages,
which shall never cease, that is impossible; because every Pain and Torment
excites or stirs up an operating Spirit and Life in every thing which suffers;
as we observe by continued Experience, and Reason teacheth us, that of necessity
it must be so; because through Pain, and the enduring thereof, every kind of
crassitude or grossness in Spirit or Body contracted is attenuated, and so the
Spirit captivated or detained in that grossness or crassitude is set at Liberty,
and made more Spiritual, and consequently more Active and Operative, through
suffering. Now seeing a Creature cannot proceed infinitely to Evil, nor slide
down into Inactivity or Silence, nor yet also into mere Eternal Passion, it
incontestably follows, that it must at length return unto Good; and by how much
the greater its Sufferings are, so much the sooner shall it return and be
restored. And so we see how a Thing (the same Substance still remaining) may be
marvellously changed in respect of the manners of its Existence; so that a
certain Holy and Blessed Spirit, or Angel of Light, could by his voluntary
Action, become a Wicked and Cursed Spirit of Darkness; which Change, or
Metamorphosis, certainly is as great as if a Spirit were changed into a Body.
And if it be here demanded, Whether those Spirits became more Corporeal by their
Transgression, than they were in their Primitive State before they fell? I
answer, Yes; but because, as I have already shown, that a Spirit is capable of
Corporiety, _Secundum majus & minus,_ or more and less; although not infinitely,
yet in many degrees. Hence it is, they could remain for many Ages, and have
nothing of such a Corporeal Crassitude, as Things in this visible. World have,
such as are hard Stones, or Metals, or the Bodies of Men and Women: For
certainly the Bodies of the worst Spirits have not such a Crassltude as any
visible Body, and yet all that grossness of visible Bodies came from the Fall of
Spirits from their First State: And so the Spirits after long and various
periods, could contract this grossness to themselves, although they could not
together, and at one and the same time fall into an universal grossness, so that
the whole Body of any fallen Spirit should be in all its parts equally gross;
but some parts become grosser and grosser; and the other Corporeal Parts of this
Spirit (which are its immediate Vehicle, and wherewith it is most intimately
united) retain a certain Tenuity or Subtilty, without which the Spirit could not
be so moveable and active as otherwise it would; and with these subtiler and
more tenuious Parts of the Body, the principal Spirit (together with its
ministring Spirits, so many of them as it can possibly gather together) departs
out of those thicker Parts of the Body, which it leaves as so many cadaverous
Bodies, which are no longer fit to serve the said Spirits in those Operations
which they exercise in their present State.

{#3} And we may observe this departure of the subtiler and stronger Spirits, out
of the harder and grosser parts of the Body, into the more soft and tenuous,
in a certain Spirituous Liquor, which is congealed with great cold, where the
stronger Spirits (forsaking the harder Parts which are outward, and chiefly
exposed to the cold) do gather themselves into the middle Part of the Body,
which is always subtile and thin, so that one only drop of that Liquor (which is
not congealed, but remaineth still liquid in the innermost Part of the congealed
Body) hath in it the augmented force of all those Parts which are congealed; so
that here is a two fold grossness and hardness of Bodies, the one palpable and
visible to our External Senses; the other invisible and impalpable, which
nevertheless is as gross as the other, yea, often grosser and harder, which may
be truly perceived by the Internal Senses, although the External Senses may be
insensible thereof; for the invisible and impalpable grossness or hardness is
that which is proper to those Bodies, which are so small, that our External
Senses cannot perceive them, when nevertheless they are really exceeding hard,
yea, harder than any Flint or Metal, which we can handle with our Hands. And out
of these hard and small Bodies, visible Waters are for the most part composed,
although they appear to us very soft, fluid, and tenuious, by reason of the
great Plenty of certain other subtile Bodies which continually agitate, and move
the said hard Particles; so that Water seems to our gross Senses to be one thing
Homogeneal, Simple, and Uniform, although it consisteth of many Heterogeneous
and Dissimilar or differing Parts, more than many other Bodies; and many of
these Parts are exceeding hard and stony, whence proceeds Gravel, bubbling
sorth, and all other little Sands and Stones, which have their Original and
Birth from the Waters springing from the bottom of the Earth; and when those
little Stones, or stony Particles of Water, grow into visible Sand and Stones,
the same after some time do again lose this hardness, and become more soft and
tenuious, than when they belonged to the Waters; for Stones do rot, and are
converted into soft Earth, and out of this proceed Animals; so also Stones
putrifying, do often become Water again; but this Water is of another _Species_
than the former, for one is petrefying, the other mollifying; as it is observed
that from one Mountain in _Helvetia_ two Kinds of Water flow, one whereof being
drunken breeds the Stone, and the other is a proper remedy against it; so that
one Water is changed into a Stone, and the other Water proceeds from that Stone,
whilst it is in Corruption, and so it alters and loseth its former hardness: And
so from what hath been said may the better be understood, how the Heart and
Spirit of a Wicked Man may be said to be hard and stony; because indeed his
Spirit hath in it a real hardness, such as is found in those little stony
Particles of certain Waters; when on the contrary the Spirits of good Men are
soft and tender; which internal softness and hardness of Spirits, we may also
really feel, and every Good Man doth as sensibly perceive the same, as the
external hardness of gross Bodies is discerned by the outward touch; but such
who are dead in their Sins, have not this sense of the hardness or softness of
Good or Evil Spirits; and therefore they call these only Metaphorical Speeches,
when indeed the Things are really so in a proper sence, and that without any
Figure.

{#4} \S. 2. THE Second Reason, that created Spirits are convertible into Bodies,
and Bodies into Spirits, I shall deduce from a serious and due consideration of
the Divine Attributes; from which, as from a Treasury of Instructions, may be
manifested the Truth of all Things: For seeing God is infinitely Good, and
communicates his Goodness infinite ways to his Creatures; so that there is no
Creature which doth not receive something of his Goodness, and that very
largely: And seeing the Goodness of God is a living Goodness, which hath Life,
Power, Love, and Knowledge in it, which he communicates to his Creatures, How
can it be, that any dead Thing should proceed from him, or be created by him,
such as is mere Body or Matter, according to their Hypothesis, who affirm, that
the same is wholly inconvertible, to any degree of Life or Knowledge? It is
truly said of one that God made not Death, and it is as true, that he made no
dead Thing: For how can a dead Thing depend of him, who is infinitely Life and
Charity? Or how can any Creature receive so vile and diminutive an Essence from
him, (who is so infinitely Liberal and Good,) that should partake nothing of
Life or Knowledge, nor ever be able to aspire to it, no not in the least degree?
Hath not God created all his Creatures for this end, that in him they might be
Blessed; and enjoy his Divine Goodness, in their several States and Conditions?
But how can this be without Life or sense? Or how can any Thing, that wanteth
Life, enjoy Divine Goodness? But we shall urge this Argument a little farther,
The Divine Attributes are commonly and rightly distinguished, into communicable,
and incommunicable; the incommunicable are, that God is a Being, subsisting by
himself, Independent, Unchangeable, absolutely Infinite, and most Perfect: The
communicable are, that he is a Spirit, Life, and Light, that he is Good, Holy,
Just, Wise, _&c._ But now there are none of these communicable Attributes, which
are not living, yea Life it self: And because every Creature hath a
Communication with God in some of his Attributes, now I demand, In what
Attribute dead Matter hath it, or a Body that is uncapable of Life and Sense for
ever? If it be said, It agrees with God in Entity, or that it is an Essence, I
Answer, In God there is no dead Being, whereof he is or can be Partaker: Whence,
therefore, shall this have its dead Essence? Moreover the Entity or Being of a
Thing is not properly an Attribute thereof; but an Attribute is properly, _tale
quid,_ or something that is predicated or affirmed of that Being: Now what
Attributes or Perfections can be attributed to dead Matter, which do
analogically Answer to those which are in God? If we diligently enquire
thereinto, we shall find none at all; for all his Attributes are living; yea,
Life it self. Moreover, seeing the Creatures of God, so far as they are
Creatures, ought necessarily in some things to resemble their Creator, now I
demand, in what dead Matter is like unto God? If they say again in naked Entity,
I Answer, There is none such in God or his Creatures: And so it is a mere _non
ens,_ or nothing.

{#5} But as touching the other Attributes of Matter, _viz._ Impenetrability;
Figurability, and Mobility; certainly none of these have any place in God, and
so are not of his communicable Attributes; but rather Essential Differences or
Attributes of Diversity, whereby the Creature, as such, is distinguished from
God; as also Mutability is of the Number of those differential Attributes,
whence it cannot be said that Mutability is of the communicable Attributes of
God: And in like manner, Impenetrability, Figurability, and Mobility, do not
pertain unto the communicable Attributes of God; but to those only in which the
Creatures differ from him. And seeing dead Matter doth not partake of any of the
communicable Attributes of God, we must certainly conclude, that the same is a
mere _non ens,_ or nothing, a false Fiction or Chimaera, and so a thing
impossible. If they say, it hath a Metaphysical Goodness and Truth, even as
every Being is Good and True: Again; I demand, What is that Goodness and Truth?
For if it hath no participation with any of the communicable Attributes of God,
it will be neither Good nor True, and so a mere Fiction, as before was said.
Moreover, seeing it cannot be said, wherein dead Matter doth any way partake of
Divine Goodness, much less can it be shown, how it may be capable always to
acquire a greater Perfection, _ad infinitum,_ which is the Nature of all
Creatures, _viz._ to increase, and infinitely advance towards a farther
Perfection as is before demonstrated. But what farther progress in Goodness or
Perfection hath a dead Matter? Because after it hath suffered Infinite Changes
of Motion and Figure it is constrained always to remain dead, as before; and if
Motion and Figure contribute nothing to the receiving of Life, then certainly
this is made never the better; nay, is not in the least degree promoted in
Goodness: For suppose this dead Matter had undergone all Forms, and been
transmuted into all Kinds of Figures, even the most regular and exact: What doth
this profit this Matter or Body, because it wants all Life and Sense? So let us
suppose the same to have undergone Infinite Kinds of Motion, from slowness to
swiftness; Wherein, therefore, is it better, by the way of its Intrinsecal
Melioration? For the Argument speaketh of Intrinsecal Melioration, which is such
a Melioration as the Nature of the Thing it self requireth, and which is
performed thereby; but a mere dead Body, or Matter, requires no kind of Motion
or Figure; nor, in it self, is perfected more by one Motion, or Figure, than by
another; for it is alike indifferent to all Motions and Figures whatsoever, and
by consequence is not perfected or bettered by any of them. And then what
advantage will it have from all these helps, if it always remain a dead and
impassible Thing.

{#6} \S. 3. MY Third Reason is drawn from the great Love and Desire that the
Spirits or Souls have towards Bodies, and especially towards those with which
they are united, and in which they have their Habitation: But now the Foundation
of all Love or Desire, whereby one Thing is carried unto another, stands in
this, That either they are of the same Nature and Substance with them, or like
unto them, or both; or that one hath its Being from the other, whereof we have
an Example in all living Creatures which bring forth their young; and in like
manner also in Men, how they love that which is born of them: For so also even
Wicked Men and Women (if they are notextremely perverse, and void of Parental
Love) do Love their Children, and cherish them with a Natural Affection, the
cause whereof certainly is this, That their Children are of the same Nature and
Substance, _viz._ as though they were Parts of them; and if they are like them,
either in Body, Spirit, or Manners, hereby their Love is the more increased: So
also we observe that Animals of one _Species_ love one another more than those
that are of a different _Species;_ whence also Cattle of one Kind feed together;
Birds of a Kind flock together; and Fishes of a Kind swim together; and so Men
rather converse with Men than with any other Creatures: But besides this
particular Love, there remains yet something of Universal Love in all Creatures,
one towards another, setting aside that great confusion which hath fallen out
since, by reason of Transgression; which certainly must proceed from the same
Foundation, _viz._ in regard of their First Substance and Essence, they were all
one and the same Thing, and as it were Parts and Members of one Body. Moreover,
in every _Species_ of Animals, we see how the Male and Female Love one another,
and in all their Propagations (which are not Monstrous, and contrary to Nature)
they respect each other; and that proceeds not only from the unity of Nature,
but also by reason of a certain eminent similitude or likeness between them. And
both these Foundations of Love between a Man and a Woman, are expresly mentioned
in _Genesis;_ but that which _Adam_ spoke concerning his Wife, _This is Bone of
my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh,_ &c. pertains unto the Unity of Nature; for she
was taken out of him, and was a part of him, and therefore he loved her.
Moreover also, concerning Similitude, it is said, there was no Help found for
him, or before his Face, as it is in the _Hebrew, (i. e.)_ among all Creatures
he saw not his like, with whom he would converse, until _Eve_ was made for him.
But there is yet another cause of Love, when Beings, that love each other, are
not one Substance, but one gave Being to the other, and is the proper and real
cause thereof. And so it is in the case between God and Creatures; for he gave
to all, Being, Life, and Motion; and therefore he loves all Creatures; neither
can he not love them; yea, at the same time when he seems to hate and be angry
with them, this his Anger, and what proceeds therefrom, _viz._ Punishments and
Judgments, turns to their Good, because he perceiveth they have need of them.
So, on the contrary, the Creatures which have not wholly degenerated, and lost
all sense of God, do love him; and this is a certain Divine Law, and Instinct,
which he put in all rational Creatures, that they might love him, which is the
fulfilling of the whole Law: But those Creatures which draw most near unto God
in similitude or likeness, do love him the more, and are the more loved of him.
But if it be thought there is another principal cause of Love, to wit, Goodness,
which is the most vehement or powerful _Magnet_ thereof, whence also God is
above all the most to be loved; because he is the best; which Goodness is in
some measure in Creatures, either really or apparently; wherefore such are loved
of their Fellow-Creatures: I Answer: It must be granted indeed, that Goodness is
a great, yea the greatest Cause of Love, and the proper Object of it; but this
Goodness is not a distinct Cause from those before laid down, but is
comprehended in them. Wherefore do we call a Thing Good? But because it either
really or apparently pleases us, for the unity it hath with us, or which we have
with it: Hence it comes to pass, that Good Men love Good Men, and not otherwise;
for Good Men cannot love Evil, nor Evil Men Good Men as such; for there is no
greater similitude than between Good and Good: For the reason why we call or
esteem a Thing Good, is this, that it benefits us, and that we are made
Partakers of its Goodness, and so here the First Cause of Similitude is still
Militant: So likewise, when one Thing gives being to another, as when God and
Christ give Being to Creatures (as from whom have every true Essence proceeded,)
here is in like manner a certain Similitude; for it is impossible that the
Creatures should not in some Things be like their Creator, and agree with him in
some Attributes or Perfections.

{#7} This being supposed a Touch-stone, we shall now return to our subject
matter, _(i. e.)_ to examine, whether Spirits and Bodies are of one Nature and
Substance, and so convertible one into another? Therefore, I demand, What is the
reason, That the Spirit or Soul so loveth the Body wherewith it is united, and
so unwillingly departs out of it, that it has been manifestly notorious, the
Souls of some have attended on, and been subject to their Bodies, after the Body
was dead, until it was corrupted, and dissolved into dust. That the Spirit or
Soul gave a distinct Being to the Body, or the Body to the Spirit, cannot be the
reason of this Love; for that were Creation in a strict sence; but this _(viz.)_
to give Being unto Things agrees only to God and Christ; therefore that
necessarily comes to pass by reason of that similitude they have one with
another, or some Affinity in their Natures: Or, if it be said, there is a
certain Goodness in the Body, which moves the Spirit to love it, certainly this
Goodness must necessarily answer to something in the Soul which is like it,
otherwise it could not be carried unto it; yea, let them inform us what that
Goodness in the Body is, for which the Soul doth so servently love it? or in
what Attributes or Perfections a Body is like a Spirit; if a Body is nothing but
a dead Trunk, and a certain Mass which is altogether uncapable of any degree of
Life, and Perfection? if they say a Body agrees with a Spirit _Ratione entis,_
or in respect of Being; that is to say; as this hath Being so that hath the
same; this is already refuted in the former Argument; for if this Being hath no
Attributes or Perfections wherein it may agree with the Being of a Spirit, then
it is only a mere Fiction; for God created no Naked _Ens,_ or Being, which
should be a mere Being, and have no Attributes that may be predicated of it;
besides also, _Ens_ is only a Logical Notion or Term, which Logicians do call
_Genus generalissimum,_ or the most General Kind, which in the naked and
abstracted Notion of it, is not in the Things themselves, but only in the
Conception or Humane Intellect. And therefore every true Being is a certain
single Nature, whereof may be affirmed such and such Attributes: Now what are
those Attributes of Body, wherein it resembles a Spirit? Let us examine the
principal Attributes of Body, as distinct from a Spirit, according to their
Opinion, who so much dispute, that Body and Spirit are so infinitely distant in
Nature, that one can never become the other: The Attributes are these, That a
Body is impenetrable of all other Bodies, so that the parts thereof cannot
penetrate each other; but there is another Attribute of Body, _viz._ to be
discerpible or divisible into parts: But the Attributes of Spirit (as they
define it) are penetrability and indiscerpibility, so that one Spirit can
penetrate another; also, that a thousand Spirits can stand together one within
another, and yet possess no more Space than one Spirit, Moreover, that a Spirit
is so simple, and one in it self, that it cannot be rent asunder, or actually
divided into separate parts. If now the Attributes of Body and Spirit are
compared together, they are so far from being like one another, or having any
Analogy of Nature (in which nevertheless the true Foundation of Love and Unity
doth consist, as before was said,) that they are plainly contrary; yea, nothing
in the whole World can be conceived so contrary to any Thing, as Body and
Spirit, in the opinion of these Men. For here is a pure and absolute contrariety
in all their Attributes; because Penetrability and Impenetrability are more
contrary one to another than black and white, or hot and cold: For that which is
black may become white, and that which is hot may become cold: But (as they say)
that which is impenetrable cannot be made penetrable; yea, God and Creatures do
not so infinitely differ in Essence one from another; as these Doctors make Body
to differ from Spirit: For there are many Attributes, in which God and the
Creatures agree together; but we can find none, wherein a Body can any way agree
with a Spirit, and by consequence, nor with God, who is the chiefest and purest
of Spirits; wherefore it can be no Creature, but a mere Non-entity or Fiction:
But as Body and Spirit are contrary in the Attributes of Penetrability and
Impenetrability; so are they no less contrary in Discerpibility and
Indiscerpibility: But if they alledge, that Body and Spirit do agree in some
Attributes, as Extension, Mobility, and Figurability; so that Spirit hath
Extension, and can reach from one place to another, and also can move it self
from place to place, and form it self into whatsoever Figure it pleaseth, in
which cases it agrees with a Body, and a Body with it: To this I Answer:
Supposing the first, that a Spirit can be extended (which yet many of them deny,
yea most, who teach that Body and Spirit are essentially distinct) yet the
Extension of Body and Spirit, as they understand it, do wonderfully differ; for
the Extension of Body is always impenetrable; yea, to be extended, and
impenetrable, as pertaining to Body, is only one real Attribute proposed in two
Mental and Logical Notions, or ways of speaking; for what is Extension, unless
the Body (wheresoever it is) be impenetrable of its own proper parts? But remove
this Attribute of Impenetrability from a Body, and it cannot be conceived any
longer, as extended. Moreover also, the Extension of Body and Spirit, according
to their Notion, infinitely differ; for whatsoever Extension a Body hath, the
same is so necessary and essential to it, that it is impossible for it to be
more or less extended; when nevertheless a Spirit may be more or less extended,
as they affirm; and seeing to be moveable and figurable, are only consequential
Attributes of Extension, (for that a Spirit is far otherwise moveable and
figurable than a Body, because a Spirit can move and form it self as a Body
cannot:) The same Reason which is good against the one is good against the other
also.

{#8} \S. 4. BUT, Secondly, How can they prove Impenetrability is an Essential
Attribute of Body; or that Penetrability is an Essential Attribute of Spirit?
Why may not Body be more or less impenetrable, and Spirit more or less
penetrable, as it may, and indeed doth happen in all other Attributes? For, _ex.
gr._ some Body may be more or less heavy or light, condensed or rarefied, solid
or liquid, hot or cold; then why may it not also be more or less penetrable, or
impenetrable? If it be said, that in all those other Mutations we always
observe, that a Body remains impenetrable, as Iron when it is heat red-hot, yet
remains still impenetrable: I Answer, I grant it may remain impenetrable of any
other Body of equal thickness; yet may, and is entirely penetrated of a more
subtile Body, _sc._ of the Fire which hath entred into it, and penetrated all
its parts, whereby 'tis made so soft; and if the Fire be stronger, begins wholly
to melt. But if, against this, they Object, that the ingress of Fire into the
Iron, is not penetration in a Philosophical Sence, nor as they understand it,
_viz._ as though the Fire and Iron did possess but one place, and so the one
could be intrinsecally present in the other; because it is manifest to the
contrary, that Iron (if it be made candent or glowing hot) it swelleth and
acquireth a greater Bulk, than when it is cold; and as it waxeth cold again, it
returneth to its former dimension. To this I Answer: If they mean such a
Penetration, which we call Intrinseck Presence, _viz._ that one Homogeneal
Substance should enter into another, both being of equal Dimensions, and yet the
bulk or quantity not increased, that seems wholly irrational: And it would be a
mere impossibility and contradiction to grant such an intimate Presence in
Creatures, which only agrees unto God and Christ as Creators, whose Prerogative
it is to be intrinsecally present in Creatures; whereas no Creature can have
that Intrinseck Presence in its Fellow Creature, because then it would cease to
be a Creature, and obtain one of the incommunicable Attributes of God and
Christ, which is Intrinseck Presence. This (I say) is primarily to be attributed
to God, and secondarily to Christ, in as much as he is _Medium quid,_ or a
certain _Medium_ between God and Creatures, and who as he is Partaker of
Mutability and Immutability, of Eternity and Time; so he may be said to be
Partaker of Body and Spirit, and consequently of Place and Extension: For, in as
much as his Body is of another Substance than the Bodies of all other Creatures,
(as of whom he is the nearest Beginning to God,) it may be truly said, he is
intrinsecally present in them, and yet not so as to be confounded with them. For
to suppose one Creature intrinsecally present in another, so as to be mingled
and most perfectly united with it, and yet its Quantity or Extension not
increased, that confounds the Creatures, and maketh two or more to be but one:
Yea, according to this Hypothesis, it may be said the whole Creation is
reducible into the quantity of the least Grain or Dust, because every part would
be supposed to penetrate another, and no greater extension follow than of one
Part. But if it be said, that only proves that Spirits may be reduced into so
small a space but not Bodies: Because Bodies are Impenetrable. I Answer, This is
but a begging of the question, because they have not yet proved that Body and
Spirit are distinct Substances; which, unless they are, it follows that one
Nature is not more penetrable than the other, according to their sence. And
indeed it seems very consentaneous to Reason, that as Times are each of them so
extended into their due Measures and Extensions, that they cannot exceed those
Bounds, and so cannot be intrinsecally present one with another; as _(ex. gr.)_
the First Day of the Week cannot be present with the Second Day of the same
Week; nor the First Hour of the Day with the Second; neither is the First Minute
of an Hour present with the Second Minute thereof; because such is the Nature
and Essence of Time, that it is successive, and hath _partes extra partes,_ or
parts, one without another. When nevertheless God is really and intrinsecally
present in all Times, and is not changed, which cannot be said of the Creature,
_sc._ that that is present in all or more Times, and not changed; for the
Creature is perpetually changed with Times, seeing Times are nothing else but
the Motion or Change of the Creature from one State or Condition into another.
And as it is in the case of Time, and Creatures which are in Time, so also in
the case of Place, Bulk, or Quantity; for as in God there is no Time, so also in
him there is no Bulk or Corporeal Quantity; but in Creatures there is both Time
and Corporeal Quantity; because otherwise they would be either God, or Nothing,
which is impossible. For whatsoever Quantity, Bulk, or Extension any Creature
hath, it retains the same, as something which is of its own Essence; as it is
the Essence of Time to consist of more parts, and those again of more, and so
_ad infinitum:_ For it may be easily conceived how a less Time is in a greater,
_ex. gr._ how so many Minutes are in an Hour, and so many Hours in a Day; and
one Hour doth immediately touch the next, but cannot be present in it, the same
is to be understood of the Creatures, in regard of their Quantity or Bulk; for
indeed one Creature may immediately touch another, but cannot be present in all
its parts, but only a less may be in a greater, and a subtiler in a grosser; and
this is more properly Penetration which agrees to Bodies as well as Spirits; as
some Body, that is less gross may penetrate another that is more gross; but two
Bodies of an equal thickness cannot penetrate each other: The same may be said
of Spirits which have their degrees of more or less grossness, as Bodies have:
Neither is there any other difference between Body and Spirit, (if Body be not
taken in their sence, who teach that it is a Thing merely Dead, and void of
Life, or a Capacity thereof; but in a proper sence: _sc._ that it is an
excellent Creature having Life and Sense, which either actually or potentially
agrees to it) but this that a Body is the grosser part of a thing, and Spirit
the subtiler, whence also Spirit hath it's name from the Air, which is the most
subtile Nature in this visible World. In _Kabbal. denud._ Tom. 2. Tract. ult. p.
6. \S. 13. Spirit is rather defined, a central Nature, having a Faculty to send
forth a Sphere full of Light and to inlarge or contract the same, which properly
seems to be _Aristotle_'s $$enteleceia$$, and _ibid._ p. 28. \S. 4. Matter is
defined: A naked Centre, or a Point wanting Eradiation, which _Aristotle_
understood by Privation: Whence we must conclude, that the Impenetrability of
these Creatures is to be understood of their Centres: For the _Hebrew_ Word,
$ךוח$, which signifies a Spirit, signifies also Air; and because Air
hath a very swift Motion, all swiftness of Motion is imputed to the Spirit in
the moved Body: Hence out of Popular Ignorance, when in certain Bodies they
perceived no Motion, they termed them Dead, wanting both Life and Spirit: But
indeed there is no where any such Body that hath not Motion, and by consequence
Life and Spirit. Therefore every Creature hath its due Quantity or Extension,
which it cannot exceed, and wherein also it cannot be diminished.

{#9} Neither doth this hinder, that we observe, how some very small Body may be
extended into a Space a Thousand times greater than it had; even as Gun-Powder,
if it be set on Fire doth marvellously extend it self; for all this Extension is
made by Division of Parts into Parts, still less and less, which indeed do not
fill all that Space so great as it seems, when in the mean while each part hath
neither greater nor lesser Extension than it had before. Supposing this, it must
be concluded that all Creatural Spirits, which are present in Bodies, are either
in the Pores of the said Bodies, or in certain Concavities made there, as Moles
make in the Earth; or else they cause the said Bodies to be puffed up, and
acquire a greater Extension; as when Fire copiously enters Iron, it notably
puffs up and extends the same: And although this Turgescency, or puffing up of
Bodies, cannot be always observed by our External Senses; yet it cannot
therefore be denied: For 'tis possible, that a certain Body may considerably
grow or increase in its dimensions, and become intirely greater, and yet this
increase of Magnitude may shun all outward Observation; yea, it may be so
subtile that it cannot be expressed by Numbers; _ex. gr._ let us suppose some
Body, whose Solidity or Cube may contain 64 Parts, and another whose Solidity
contains 100, where the root of the former Body whose Cube is 64 is 4; so that
the side of that Body contains four Longitudes of the Parts so divided; but the
side or root of the other Body, whose Cube is 100, can be expressed by no
Number; for it is greater than 4, and less than 5, and no Fraction can determine
the same: Therefore Bodies (as was said) may be considerably swoln or puffed up,
(if more Spirits or subtiler Bodies enter into them,) and yet so as that our
gross Senses may judge them not at all greater. Now that we may come to the
other Attribute, which is said to be of Body but not of Spirit, _viz._
Discerpibility; if they understand it so; that one only Body, even the least
that can be conceived (if any such Body can be conceived) may be divided; that
is certainly impossible; for it is a contradiction in terms, and supposes every
the least Body to be discerpible into lesser Parts. But if Body be taken
individually only for one single Body, that is indiscerpible; and that which we
call the Discerpibility of Body means only this, _sc._ that we may divide one
Body from another, by placing some Third Body between them; and according to
this sence Spirits are no less discerpible than Bodies; for although one single
Spirit cannot become two or more Spirits, yet more Spirits co-existing in one
Body, are no less separable one from another than Bodies; for however Bodies or
Spirits may be divided or separated one from another in the whole Universe, yet
they still remain united in this separation; seeing the whole Creation is still
but one Substance or Entity, neither is there a _Vacuum_ in it; How then can any
thing be separated from it self? I mean, from that which is its proper Nature,
as considered Originally, or in its Beginning, or First Being? But as there is a
General Unity of all Creatures one with another, so that none can be separated
from his Fellow-Creatures; so there is a more special and particular Unity
between the Parts of one particular _Species:_ As when the Body is divided, or
torn asunder, and the Members removed one from another unto a certain distance,
so long as these Members are not corrupted, and changed into another _Species,_
they still send certain subtile Particles one to another, and to the Body from
whence they came, and the Body sends the like unto them, (which we call Spirits,
and Bodies, or Spirits, for they are either,) by means whereof the Parts and
Members so apparently separated, still retain a certain real Unity and Sympathy,
as is manifest from sundry Examples; and especially the two following: The First
of which is this: A certain Man wanting a Nose, ordered one to be made for him
out of the Flesh of another Man, which being vitally agglutinated, (as a Scion
or Graft is united with the Trunk of the Tree into which it is put;) when the
other Man died, and his Body corrupted, this Nose was likewise corrupted, and
fell from the Body of this living Man. The Second Example is of a Man whose Leg
was cut off; which Leg being removed some considerable distance from the rest of
the Body, when a certain Chirurgeon cut it, this Man complained of Pains, and
showed in what part the said Leg was wounded, which manifestly proves that there
is a certain Union of Parts, though separated at a great distance one from
another: And so also Individuals of one _Species,_ or such who have a singular
Affinity in _Specie,_ have a Union one with another, although locally distant,
which is yet more manifest in Humane Kind: For if two Men intirely love one
another, they are by this love so united, that no distance of place can divide
or separate them; for they are present (one with another) in Spirit; so that
there passeth a continual Efflux, or Emanation of Spirits, from the one to the
other, whereby they are bound together, and united as with Chains: And so
whatsoever a Man loves, whether it be Man or Beast, whether a Tree, or whether
Silver or Gold, he is united with the same, and his Spirit passeth into that
very Thing; and here is to be observed, that though the Spirit of Man is
commonly spoken in the Singular, as; though it were but one Thing; yet the said
Spirit is a certain composition of more, yea innumerable Spirits; as the Body is
a composition of more Bodies, and hath a certain Order and Government in all its
Parts, much more the Spirit which is a great Army of Spirits, wherein there are
distinct Offices under one governing Spirit. And so from hence it appears that
Impenetrability and Indiscerpibility, are not more Essential Attributes of Body,
than of Spirit; because in one sence they agree unto either, in another sence
unto neither.

{#10} But against this Infiniteness of Spirits in every Spirit, and Infiniteness
of Bodies in every Body, may be objected that Saying: God made all Things in
Number, Weight, and Measure; wherefore there cannot be an infinite multitude of
Spirits in one Man, nor an innumerable multitude of Bodies in one Body? But I
Answer that the infiniteness or innumerability of Spirits, and Bodies is only to
be understood in respect of the Creatures understanding; so that they cannot be
numbred, nor the outward Extension of Body and Spirit (that may happen in them)
be measured by the knowledge of any Creature. But that God hath perfectly known
the Number and Measure of all Creatures is freely granted. And if God made all
Things in Number, Weight, and Measure; then certainly every Creature will have
its Number, Weight, and Measure; and by consequence we cannot say of any
Creature, that it is but one single Thing, because it is a Number, and Number is
a multitude, or more than one; and indeed the Nature of a Creature is such, that
the same cannot be merely one single Thing, in case it ought to act or do
something, and so enjoy that Goodness which is prepared for it by its Creator:
For _(ex. gr.)_ let us suppose but one Atom to be separated from its
Fellow-Creatures, What can that do to perfect it self, or make it self greater
or better? What can it see, hear, taste, or feel, either from within or without?
It cannot have internal Motion; because every Motion hath at least two Terms or
Extreams, _viz. Terminus à quo,_ and _Terminus ad quem;_ or, _the Term from
which,_ and _the Term to which:_ And seeing this is but one Atom or Centre,
certainly it cannot have any Motion within it self, _è Termino à quo, & ad
quem;_ and consequently, seeing it cannot hear, see, taste, or feel, _ab intra,_
or, _from within,_ it cannot have it from other Creatures, _ab extra,_ or, _from
without;_ for if it ought to see, hear, feel, or taste any other Creature, it is
required to receive the Image of this Creature within it self, which it cannot
do, because it is an Atom, and an Atom is so small that it can receive nothing
within it: For as the Organs of the external Senses are composed of more parts;
so also are the Organs of the internal, and consequently all Knowledge requires
variety or multitude, which is the Subject or Receptacle of it: I mean all
Creatural Knowledge, where Knowledge is received or excited from known Things or
Objects, (whereas the Knowledge of God is not received or excited by Creatures,
but is originally in and from himself.) Seeing, therefore, the Objects of our
Knowledge are various, and every Object sends its Image into us, and that Image
is a real Being, it follows we have many Images in us, which cannot be all
received in an Atom, but have need of their distinct Places in us, in their
distinct Forms and Figures; otherwise there would not only follow a confusion,
but many Things would be present one with another without any Extension, which
is repugnant to the Nature of a Creature. And although the Objects of our
Knowledge are many; as for Example, I am manifold, who receive so many Images
from those Objects; yet from thence it doth not follow, because I who know
something am manifold, that therefore I ought to behold one Object as if it was
many, so that seeing one Man I should see many; for when many Men see one Man
they do not behold him as many Men, but as one Man only: So when I look up and
behold something with both my Eyes (unless peradventure there be any confusion
in my sight) they do not seem to me as two, but one; and if I could behold
something with ten thousand Eyes, as I do with two, certainly that Thing,
whether an Horse or a Man, would not seem otherwise to me than one alone. Hence
appears to us a great distinction between God and Creatures; for he is One, and
this is his Perfection, that he hath need of nothing without him: But a
Creature, because it needs the assistance of its Fellow-Creatures, ought to be
manifold, that it may receive this assistance; for that which receives something
is nourished by the same, and so becomes a part of it, and therefore it is no
more one but many, and so many indeed as there are Things received, and yet of a
greater multiplicity; therefore there is a certain Society or Fellowship among
Creatures in giving and receiving, whereby they mutually subsist one by another,
so that one cannot live without another; for what Creature in the whole World
can be found that hath no need of its Fellow-Creature? Certainly none; therefore
by consequence every Creature which hath Life, Sense, or Motion, ought to be a
Number, or a Multiplicity; yea, a Number without Number, or Infinite in respect
of any created Intellect. But if it be said, ought not the Central or governing
Spirit to be but one only Atom; for otherwise how can it be called a Centre, and
the chief Spirit, having Dominion over the rest? I Answer in the Negative: For
this Centre it self, or chief, and governing Spirit, is manifold, for the
Reasons before alledged; but it is called a Centre, because all the other
Spirits concur to it, as Lines from all parts of the Circumference do meet at
the Centre, and do again depart out or proceed therefrom; and indeed the unity
of the Spirits that compose or make up this Centre, or governing Spirit, is more
firm and tenacious, than that of all the other Spirits; which are, as it were,
the Angels or Ministring Spirits of their Prince or Captain; yea, in Man this
Unity is so great, that nothing can dissolve it, (although the Unity of the
greatest Plenty of Ministring Spirits, which belong not to the composition of
this Centre) may be dissolved: Hence it comes to pass that the Soul of every Man
shall remain an entire everlasting Soul, or be of endless duration, that it may
receive the proper Fruit of its labour, and that the Universal Law of Justice
(which is written on every Thing) doth require, which is as a most strong and
indissolvable Band to preserve this Unity: For what is more congruous with this
Infinite Justice and Wisdom than this, That they who have joined together, and
consented to work either Good or Evil, shall together receive their due Reward
and Punishment, which cannot be if they should be dissipated or separated one
from another; and the same reason doth prove, that the Central Spirits of all
other Creatures remain indissolvable; and that although new Central Spirits are
continually form'd in the Production of Things; yet no Central Spirit is
dissolved, but farther promoted, or at least diminished, according to the
present dignity or indignity, capacity or incapacity thereof.
