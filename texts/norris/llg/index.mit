  The letters between Astell and Norris were first published in 1695. Our
  copytext is the second edition of 1705, which is, according to its title page,
  ‘Corrected by the Authors, with some few Things added’. The text is derived
  from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP. Several changes have
  been made to this source, correcting some errors and bringing the text in line
  with the 1705 edition.
