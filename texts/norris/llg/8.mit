£2 LETTER VIII. £2
£2 _Mr. _Norris's_ Answer._ £2

{#1} I Am no less pleased than your self that my great Argument for the intire
Love of GOD taken from his being the only true Cause of our good, is so well
discharged of that Difficulty which you urged against it, because (as I told you
in my first) I think it the only material one to which it stands exposed, and
because it has received from your skilful Hand the utmost Advantage it was
capable of. So that now I cannot but conclude the Bottom I go upon to be very
sound, not expecting to be attacked by a stronger Objection, or by one better
managed. The same occurred to my own Thoughts while I was composing my
Discourse, but I thought it would be time enough to consider it when it came to
be objected, and I have since met with a little flying Touch of it in a modern
Philosopher of very considerable Note, =Monsieur _Regis_= a _Cartesian,_ who in
the _16th._ Chapter of his [_Metaphysicks_] contends upon this very Ground that
GOD is not the Moral Good of Man, GOD (says he) is not the Moral Good of Man
neither because he produces those things which are agreeable to him, nor because
he causes those Pleasures which he feels. Not the first, because GOD would then
be the moral good of all other Creatures as well as Man, because he does as much
produce what in agreeable to them as what is so to Man. Not the second, because
GOD would then be no less the moral evil of Man than his moral good, because he
does no less produce the Pain which he suffers, than the Pleasure which he
enjoys. From which without adding a Word more, as if this had been a most clear
and incontestable Demonstration, he positively concludes that GOD is not the
moral good of Man. Not only that he is not so for this Reason as the Cause of
our Pleasure (as your Objection runs) but that he is not so at all. For he
concludes that if he be so, it must be upon one or other of the forementioned
Accounts, which since he is not, therefore he will not allow him to be so at
all. A strange Paradox by the way, but what Force there is in the Proof of it
may be determined from the Measures premised.

{#2} The other Difficulty against the intire Love of GOD taken from its
Inconsistency with the Love of our Neighbour (which you say you have heard some
urge against my Account of the first and great Commandment) is indeed in one
respect more pressing than the former, though easier to be resolved, because it
is directly levelled, not against the Reason only of the Proposition, but the
Truth of it. But I wonder to hear of this Objection as pertinent as it is, since
I thought I had already laid in a sufficient Caution against it in the Discourse
it self. For 'tis most certain that the most intire Love of GOD enjoyn'd in the
first Commandment does by no means exclude the Love of our Neighbour injoyned in
the second, in case these two Loves be of two different Kinds, the former
suppose, Love of Desire, and the latter Love of Benevolence, there being no
manner of Repugnancy between the desiring none but GOD, and the wishing well to
Men, and 'tis only the joyning these two different Ideas under one common Name
_(Love)_ that makes it seem as if there were. To love none but GOD, and yet to
love others besides GOD, do indeed seem to be contradictory Propositions, but
'tis all because of the Equivocation of the Word _(Love)_ which when applied to
GOD in the first Commandment signifies desiring him as a good, and when applied
to Men in the second signifies not desiring them as a Good, but desiring good to
them. And cannot I thus love GOD only, and my Neighbour too, and so fulfil both
Commands? Cannot I desire but one thing only in the World, and yet at the same
time wish well to every thing else? 'Tis plain that I may, and that the
Intireness of my Love to GOD does no way prejudice my Love to my Neighbour,
supposing the latter Love to be of a different Kind from the former. Those
therefore that will have one of these to be exclusive of the other, ought first
to prove that the Word _(Love)_ used in both commands is taken according to the
same Sense in both, that by Love of our Neighbour is meant Love of Desire as
well as by the Love of GOD, without which their Objection is precarious, and
instead of proving, they do but beg the Question. And I should be glad to see
any of our Objectors prove what hitherto they are pleased to presume, that by
Love of our Neighbours is intended Love of Desire.

{#3} If they on the other hand demand what Proof I have that the Love of our
Neighbour here is not Love of Desire, I answer, first that according to all the
Laws of Dispute I may reasonably take leave to suppose that it is not, till my
Objectors prove that it is. Since my Account of the first Commandment does not
overthrow the second but only upon Supposition that Love of our Neighbour there
signifies Love of Desire, they that lay that to my Charge ought in all Logick
and Conscience to prove that it has that Signification, till which time I may
fairly suppose that it has not, and that the rather because they themselves
cannot pretend that Desire is the only thing that is called by the Name of Love,
but must needs allow that there is also a Love of Benevolence, and that these
two have very distinct Idea's. But not to insist upon a Privilege I do not need:
I answer again that all those Arguments whereby I prove that GOD only ought to
be loved with Love of Desire, do also implicity prove that that is not the Love
wherewith we are to love our Neighbour, and consequently that that is not the
Love intended in the second Commandment, but only Love of Benevolence. For since
there are but these two Sorts of Love, and since (which is the very Foundation
of the Objection) the intire Love of GOD is not consistent with the Love of our
Neighbour, as Love signifies Desire, if I prove that GOD only ought to be loved
with Love of Desire (as I think I have done) then it must follow either that our
Neighbour ought not to be loved at all, which is manifestly absurd, or that Love
of Benevolence is the _Love_ that must fall to his share, and that which
consequently is enjoyned in the second Commandment. And I wonder how it should
enter into so many Men's Heads, as it does, to imagine that any other _Love_
than this was here intended. For though it were otherwise never so lawful and
allowable to love our Neighbour with _Love_ of Desire, and he otherwise never so
capable of it, yet is it imaginable that this should be made the matter of a
_Command,_ and required of us as a Duty! Is it once to be thought that God who
is an infinite Good, infinitely desirable, infinitely deserving of our highest
Affections, nay of our whole Love; and withall infinitely able to satisfie and
reward it, should Command us to Love or Desire a Creature, and a Creature as
vain and infirm and insufficient, as much a Shadow as our selves, and that
immediately after he had in such Emphatick Terms required us to fix our Love
upon himself? Is it I say to be thought, that GOD when he had laid it upon us as
a Duty to repose our selves upon his own Stable Centre, should immediately after
require us to lean upon that which cannot sustain its own weight? That when he
had commanded us to come and quench our mighty Thirst at his own ever springing
Fountain (with whom as the Psalmist speaks _is the Well of Life_) he should in
the very next Breath send us away to a Cistern, and that too a broken one? That
he should first call us to himself, and then as if he alone were not able to
suffice for us, and to satisfie those inlarged Appetites which he had given us,
should call in the Creatures to bear part of the Expence, and send us from
himself to them? Are these Thoughts worthy of GOD? But besides, let me Appeal to
any of those who contend for Love of Desire as the Love of the Second
Commandment, Do they ever feel any Remorse of Conscience for having been wanting
in Love of Desire towards their Neighbour; or does their Conscience ever upbraid
them for having thereby fail'd in their regard towards the Second Commandment;
or do they ever think it necessary to Repent for having been defective in this
kind of Love? Our Conscience indeed does often upbraid to us our Desire of
Creatures (as you very well remark from our Bashfulness and Unwillingness to own
our selves to be in Love) but never that I know of, does it Reproach us for our
Indifferency towards them, or prompt us to Repent of it. And indeed it would be
a strange kind of Repentance for a Man to fall upon his Knees, and Confess to
GOD as a Sin, that he had withdrawn all his Desires from his Creatures and fix'd
them wholly upon him; that he did not desire them as his good, though at the
same time he wish'd them, and was ready to do them all the good he could. I
dread to speak the Language of such a Penitent, when I consider what an absurd
Command he Fathers upon God. For can we imagine that GOD will charge that person
as guilty of the Second Commandment who intirely loves him, and bears a hearty
good-will to his Fellow Creatures, merely because he does not also desire them
as his good? Is it not enough to wish and do well to them? For tell me Madam,
what you think of this supposition: I will suppose a Man to place his whole
Affection upon GOD, and so to love him with all his Heart, Soul, Mind and
Strength, as to withdraw his Love from all the Creatures, and not in the least
to desire any of them as his goods, only to desire good to them all, to do them
good as far as he has opportunity, and to endeavour to unite them to the true
good. I further suppose him to persevere in this Disposition of Mind to the very
last, and then ask whether you can think that such a Person has any thing to
answer at the Bar of GOD's Justice for the Breach of the second Commandment, or
whether you think God will damn and eternally separate such an one from his
Presence, as defective in his Measures of Charity merely for not making
Creatures his good, and the Object of his Desire? But I need not put such a
Question to you, who I am perswaded at the first Proposal of it will be so far
from judging such a Person to be a just Object of God's Displeasure, that you
will conclude he has all that is necessary to recommend him to his highest
Favour, and to qualifie him to partake of his Sovereign Happiness. But 'tis a
Question very proper to be put to my Adversaries, who must either say that God
will damn a Person of this Character, or (which therefore appears to be
certainly the right) that Love of Desire is not the Love required of us in the
second Commandment, but only Love of Benevolence, which whoever has does by that
alone sufficiently satisfie the Intention and Obligation of that Law.

{#4} Besides, does not the Command sufficiently explain it self? For (as you
very judiciously remark) our Saviour commands us to love our Neighbour as our
selves, which by the Way seems to me not only an absolute Measure, but a
relative Character, put in on purpose to distinguish it from the Love of God.
But now, as you will resume; our Love of our selves is not Love of Desire, but
Love of Benevolence. Most undoubtedly so, for whoever reflects upon the Love of
himself will presently perceive that 'tis not a desiring of himself as his good,
but a desiring of some good to himself, as appears from that vulgar Expression,
_Charity begins at home,_ and from the Vice of Self-love, by which we mean a
craving and seeking after more than comes to a Man's Share without having Regard
to the Community, or a greedy Pursuance of ones own private Interest in
Opposition to that of the Publick. Your other Remark is no less important, that
our Saviour does also command us to love one another as he hath loved us, that
is, say you, not with Love of Desire, but that of Benevolence. For as God he
could not love us with Love of Desire, and as Man he need not, since Love of
Benevolence would answer all the Ends of his coming into the World, to which I
add that neither need he as Man because as such he was personally united to the
supreme good, with which Union I cannot conceive how the Desire of any Creature
should be consistent. For as God himself cannot desire any thing out of himself
because of his own Fulness, so neither can he that enjoys God desire any thing
out of him because of the Fulness of _GOD._ The Enjoyment of _GOD_ does
certainly put a final Period to all Desire, and utterly quench the most flaming
Thirst of a Creature, and how then can he whose Desire is satisfied desire any
further, or if he does, how then is it satisfied? For which reason by the way I
think it necessary to conclude that the blessed in Heaven finding all possible
good in the Enjoyment of _GOD_ cannot desire any thing out of him, but that all
Love of the Creature does utterly cease, and is for ever silenced in that Region
of Happiness, and that _GOD_ is all in all to those that enjoy him. But now we
cannot suppose any of the blessed Spirits so united to _GOD_ in Heaven, as our
Saviour was while upon Earth, who therefore must be supposed to love Mankind
with Love of Benevolence only (as being capable of no other) and consequently to
require the same kind of Love from Men to one another. But there needs no
Argument from without to prove this to be his meaning. The Text you refer to
([_John_ 13. 34.]) sufficiently speaks its own Sense. _A new Commandment I give
unto you, that ye love one another. As I have loved you that ye also love one
another._ Wherein 'tis plain that our Saviour refers to that signal Instance of
his Benevolence in his undertaking the Work of our Redemption, and in Proportion
requires the same sort of Love from his Disciples, that if Occasion were, they
should be ready to lay down their Lives for the Salvation of their Brethren, as
he had done for them, which is the natural Sense of the Words, and made to be so
by the best Expositors that I know of upon the Place.

{#5} But besides, does not the Scripture always express our Love towards our
Neighbour as a Love of Benevolence only? _Love_ (says the Apostle, [_Rom._ 13.
10.]) _worketh no ill to his Neighbour,_ that is, does not hurt or injure him,
but do him all good. Which Character shews it to be truly meant of Love of
Benevolence. I say truly. And that 'tis meant of that _only,_ as being of it
self intirely commensurate to the full Extent of Charity, is evident from the
Words that follow, _therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law._ Of what Law?
Not to be sure of the first Table. For our Love to our Neighbour though never so
perfect, cannot satisfie our Obligation to _GOD._ It must be therefore of the
second Table, which being thus fulfilled by Benevolence can require no other
Love than that. This is Demonstration. Again, when the same Apostle reckons up
the Fruits of Charity, does he make any mention of Desire, does he not describe
them all by the Expressions of Benevolence? He says, _it suffers long and is
kind, that it envies not, vaunts not it self, is not puffed up, does not behave
it self unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil,
rejoyces not in Iniquity, but in the Truth, that it bears all things, believes
all things, hopes all things, and indures all things,_ but it seems the Apostle
had forgot to put in Desire, or else he thought it no Part of Christian Charity.
And I must confess that I am of the latter Opinion.

{#6} And as the Scripture always speaks of Brotherly Love and Charity in Terms
importing Benevolence, so whenever it speaks of the opposite Vice does it not
always describe it by contrary Characters? Does it ever describe it by want of
Desire? No, but by want of good Will, by Anger, Wrath, Envy, Bitterness, Malice
and such like Terms. And by what Measure of Love it is that =Christ= will
proceed in his Judgment of the World, whether by Love of Benevolence or by Love
of Desire I shall leave to be determined by what he says himself concerning that
matter in the 25th Chapter of =St. _Matthew_=. From all which put together I
think nothing can be more clear and certain than that the Love intended and
required in the second great Commandment of the Law, is not Love of Desire, but
only Love of Benevolence. And I cannot imagine what (besides the Equivocation of
the Word _Love_) should make the World run so generally upon a contrary Notion,
unless it be that Clause in the Commandment: _And the second is like unto it,_
whence perhaps it has been concluded that because the first is meant of Love of
Desire, therefore the second must be so too. But he must be either much
prejudiced, or very dull-sighted that does not see that _by like unto it_ is
only meant of equal Authority and Obligation in Opposition to the Pharisaic
Partiality towards the Precepts of the Law. Well then the Result of the present
Considerations is this, since that most intire Love of _GOD_ I stand for in the
first Commandment does not at all interfere with the Love of our Neighbour in
the second supposing that by Love there we are not to understand Love of Desire,
but only Love of Benevolence, and since as I have shewn Love of Benevolence is
the Love there solely intended, I may now with Assurance conclude that the
Account I have given of the first Commandment, as high as it is, is no way
injurious to the second, the thing that is generally laid to my Charge. But you
go further, undertaking to show that my Account of the Love of GOD is so far
from being prejudicial to that of our Neighbour, that it is the only true solid
Foundation it can rest upon. I thoroughly approve what you say upon this Part,
but shall not offer to add any thing to it, because indeed you have said all. I
promised in my last that in my next I would add something to the Reason of our
loving _GOD_ so intirely, but having fallen upon a Vein of other Thoughts, and
those of no slight Importance, must beg you to let me be in your Debt for this
untill another Opportunity, as also for what you further desire concerning
Pleasure. In the mean time I leave you to that of your own Meditations, more of
which upon this great Subject will be highly grateful to //
