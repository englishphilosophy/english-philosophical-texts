£2 LETTER VI. £2
£2 _Mr. _Norris's_ Answer._ £2

{#1} IT deserves neither your Thanks nor your Admiration that I should endeavour
to be particularly civil to a Person of your extraordinary Worth and
Accomplishments, which indeed appear so great and so beyond what I ever yet
found or could imagine, as at the same time to command and lessen the highest
Respect and Deference that can be shewn to you. Your Hypothesis, as you now
explain and rectifie it, runs clear and unperplext, and has nothing in it but
what equitably understood challenges my full Consent and Approbation. The Defect
of it before lay partly in your supposing _GOD_ not to be the Author of mental
Pain (and that because you made mental Pain to be all one with Sin) and partly
in your supposing sensible Pain of which you allow'd _GOD_ to be the Author, not
to be in it self a real Evil. But now both these Faults are mended, and all is
right and as it should be. For whereas before when you confounded mental Pain
with Sin, you pleaded thus against our hating and for our loving _GOD_
notwithstanding the Pain which he is acknowledged to inflict upon us, mental
Pain is truly an Evil, but such as _GOD_ does not cause, sensible Pain _GOD_
does cause, but then that is not truly an Evil. Now distinguishing mental Pain
from Sin, and substituting Sin in the room of mental Pain, you make your Apology
for the Love of _GOD_ run thus, Sin which is truly an Evil _GOD_ does not cause,
and as for mental and sensible Pains whereof _GOD_ is the true Cause, they are
not truly and properly Evils. By which latter Clause I presume you mean not as
you seem'd to do at first, that they are not truly and properly Evils in their
own formal Natures and as simply in themselves considered (for so 'tis evident
that they are Evils, as being as such against the Happiness and Wellbeing of a
thinking and self-conscious Nature) but only as in that particular Supposition,
Juncture or Circumstance wherein they are inflicted by _GOD_, who having a
thorough comprehensive View of our whole Condition, and so knowing what upon all
Considerations is best for us, thinks it adviseable sometimes to molest and
trouble our Repose with mental or sensible Pain, not for their own sakes, or
that he is delighted in them as such any more than we our selves are, but in
order to our Good, and as they are necessary Means to avoid some greater Evil.
In which respect both Pain and Grief (though evil in their inward formal
Natures) do relatively considered so far put on the Nature of Good as to be
truly eligible, and would not fail to be actually willed and chosen by us for
our selves, as by GOD for us, if we had the same Views and Prospects of things
that he has. In this Sense it is very true and certain that both the mental and
the sensible Pain which _GOD_ inflicts in this Life (for as to the Misery of the
next I do not apprehend the present Question concerned in it) are not, all
things considered, truly and properly Evils, because upon the whole they are
eligible, which Sin can never be, it being a contradictory Supposition that that
should be eligible as a Means to avoid a greater Evil, which is it self the
greatest of all. And herein I take it consists the Peculiarity of the Evil of
Sin, that it is never eligible, but always the due and just Object of our Hatred
and Aversion. So that if in this Sense you will have Sin to be the only Evil,
that whereas all other Evils are not so far Evils but that in some Junctures and
Suppositions they may become good and eligible, Sin as being the greatest Evil
can in no Supposition imaginable become good, but remains ever a fixed and
unchangeable Evil, as GOD does a Good, without the least Variation or Shadow of
turning, I intirely consent with you, and do and hope always shall think Sin to
be thus the only Evil. And since GOD is not the Author of Sin which can never be
eligible but only of our uneasie Sentiments which in some Circumstances may, and
then are no longer to be considered as Evils, this gives clear and full
Satisfaction to that Objection against the Love of GOD taken from his being the
Cause of our painful Sensations. And I can now well conceive that GOD is always
lovely and to be loved by us, not only when under the little common Uneasinesses
of Life, but when most miserable and afflicted, even by a Martyr in his Flames.
And so we are come to a fair Resolution of this Difficulty concerning the Love
of GOD.

{#2} As to what you say concerning the Inferiour and Superiour Part of the Soul,
that you the rather us'd this Distinction because you learnt it from my
Christian Blessedness, I confess that I do there make use of this Scheme of
Speech, not intending thereby two parts of the Soul Really and Physically
distinct, but only the same Soul diversly consider'd, with respect to different
Objects and ways of Operation, In consideration of which it is usually divided
into Parts in a popular way of speaking, which in a popular Discourse and where
there was nothing of particular Theory depending upon it, I had no reason to
depart from, but rather to comply with. But when Good or Evil, Grief or Pain
come to be distinguished by their being lodg'd in this or that part of the Soul
in the Superiour or Inferiour Part (which must then signifie Parts really
Distinct) I then deny that there are any such Parts. In all other Cases I should
not scruple to speak in the common Language, not apprehending that I should give
any one thereby just occasion to think that I held two real Parts in the Soul,
any more than by using another popular mode of speaking of the Vegetative,
Sensitive, and Rational Soul in Man, that it was my real Opinion that he had
three Souls.

{#3} I like your Ingenuity in confessing that you have no Clear Idea of that
which is properly your self, and I further tell you, that you never will have
while you are in this State. We do not know our Souls here by any Idea of them,
(as not seeing them yet in GOD) but only by Consciousness or interiour
Sentiment, which is the reason that the Knowledge we have of them is so
imperfect. We see Bodies by their Idea's, but we know no more of our Souls than
what we feel to be done in them. I forbear enlarging upon this matter, though a
very noble and useful point of Speculation, because you may find a most
excellent Account given of it by _=M. Malebranche=_ in the 7th Chapter of his
Third Book [_de la recherche de la Verite_, page 352.] And again more at large
in his Illustration upon that Chapter, [_page_ 461. of _Amsterdam_ Edition]. And
the same most excellent Person elsewhere, _viz._ in his [_Meditations
Chrestiennes_ of _Cologne_ Edition, _page_ 152], gives a very satisfying Account
of the Reasons why it has not pleased _GOD_ to give us an Idea of our own Souls,
The first of which is, that if we did see clearly what we are, we could not be
so closely united to our Bodies as is necessary to the preservation of this
Animal Life. We should not look upon it as a Part of our selves, and unhappy as
we are at present, we should not think it worth our Care to preserve it, and
consequently having so little Value and Regard for it we should have no
Sacrifice to offer to GOD, _&c._ His other Reason he pursues more at large, and
because 'tis one of the loftiest Strains of Reason and Eloquence that I ever met
with, I shall give it you as near the Original as I can translate it from the
Author, who thus brings in the eternal Wisdom, speaking to her Disciple.
$Secondement parce que l'Idee d'une ame est un Object si grand, & si capable de
ravir les Esprits de sa beuatè$, &c. _Secondly, because the Idea of a Soul is an
Object so great and so apt to ravish Spirits with its Beauty, that if thou hadst
an Idea of thy Soul, thou wouldst be no longer able to think upon any thing
else. For if the Idea of Extension which represents only Bodies, does so
strongly touch Natural Philosophers and Mathematicians, that they oftentimes
forget all their Duties to contemplate it. If a Mathematician has so much
Delight when he compares Bignesses among themselves thereby to discover their
Relations that he often sacrifices his Pleasures and his Health to find out the
Properties of a Line, what Application would not Men bestow upon the Research of
the Properties of their own Being, and a Being infinitely more noble than
Bodies? What Pleasure would they not take to compare among themselves by a clear
View of the understanding so many different Modifications the bare Sentiment of
which, however feeble and confuse, does so strangely busie and employ them. For
thou must know that the Soul contains in her self all the Beauties and Finesses
that thou seest in the World, and which thou art` wont to attribute to the
Objects that environ thee. Those Colours, those Odours, those Savours, with an
Infinity of other Sentiments with which thou hast not yet been touched, are no
other than Modifications of thy own Substance. That Harmony which so elevates
thee is not in the Air which strikes thy Ear, and those infinite Pleasures of
which the greatest Voluptuaries have but a feeble Sentiment are included in the
Capacity of thy Soul. Now if thou hast a clear Idea of thy self, if thou didst
see in me that Archetypal Spirit upon which thou wast formed, thou wouldst
discover so many Beauties and so many Truths in contemplating it, that thou
wouldst neglect all thy Devoirs. Thou wouldst discover with an Extremity of Joy
that thou wouldst be capable of enjoying an Infinity of Pleasures. Thou wouldst
know clearly their Nature, thou wouldst be incessantly comparing them among
themselves, and thou wouldst discover Truths which would appear to thee so
worthy of thy Application, that wholly wrapt up and absorpt in the Contemplation
of thy own Being, full of thy self, of thy Grandeur, of thy Excellencies, and of
thy Beauty thou wouldst be no longer able to think of any thing besides. But my
Son, GOD has not made thee to think of nothing but thy self. He has made thee
for _himself._ Wherefore I shall not discover to thee the Idea of thy Being,
till that happy Time when the View of the very Essence of thy GOD shall deface
and eclipse all thy Beauties, and make thee despise all that thou art`, that
thou mayst think only of contemplating him._

{#4} The Account of this excellent Person is so satisfying, that I shall not
pretend to add any thing to it, but shall only observe from it that since 'tis
so true that we have no Idea of our own Souls, and so reasonable that we should
have none, it would be in vain to go about to define any of the Modifications of
our Spirit, which (since we have no Idea of them) must be learnt by inward
Sentiment, and can no more be made known by Words to those that have not felt
them than Colours can be described to a Man that is blind. And therefore you
must excuse me if I own my self unable to gratifie your Request, in giving you a
Definition of Pleasure, which though I know when I feel it, and am able to
distinguish from Light, or Colour, or Sound, or from the opposite Sensation of
Pain, yet since I know it by internal Consciousness only or Sentiment, and not
by Idea, I cannot by Words render it intelligible to any body else, but must
remit him that desires the Knowledge of its Nature to Sense and Experience. For
he can never know it till he feel it, and have those Motions excited in the
Organs of his Sense, to which the Author of Nature has annexed this Sensation.

{#5} However I may venture to call Pain an _uneasie Thought`_, not that I intend
thereby to define it (for I think it no more capable of a Definition strictly so
called than Pleasure) but only to intimate in general that it is a Modification
belonging to Spirit, and not to Body. For seeing clearly in the Idea which I
have of Extension, that all its Modifications reduce themselves to Figure and
Motion, or certain Relations of Distance, I conclude that Pleasure and Pain and
the rest of those Sensations which I feel in my self by interiour Sentiment, are
not Modifications belonging to my Corporeal Substance, but to some other, which
I call my Spirit. And for this reason it is that I call Pain an uneasie
Thought`. But then for the reconciling this with my saying that it anticipates
and prevents all Thought`, I need only suggest to you that when I call Pain an
uneasie Thought`, I take Thought` in its utmost Latitude, for all that we are
any way conscious of to our selves, as my most admired Philosopher does in his
[Principles of Philosophy _P. 2_]. where he says, $Cogitationis nomine intelligo
illa omnia quae nobis consciis in nobis fiunt, quatenus eorum in nobis
Conscientia est. Atque ita non modo intelligere, velle, imaginare, sed etiam
sentire idem est hic quod cogitare$; i.e. _By the Name of Thought` I understand
all those things which we are conscious to be done in our selves, so far forth
as there is in us a Conscientiousness of them. And thus not only to understand,
to will, to imagine, but even to feel is the same here as to think._ But when I
say that Pain anticipates all Thought`, by Thought` I mean all rational,
discursive and reflecting Thought`, which 'tis most certain and evident by all
Experience that Pain does prevent, and as certain that Grief does suppose,
follow and proceed from it.

{#6} But to return from these Digressions (for I call all things so that have
not an immediate Connection with Religion) to that which is the principal
Subject of our Correspondence, and ought to be the Subject of all our Thoughts,
the Love of _GOD._ Our Saviour places it in the Head of all Morality, telling us
that it is the _first and great Commandment._ And his Apostle =St. _Paul_=
places it in the Rear of it, telling us that _the End of the Commandment is
Charity._ So then from both these put together the Result will be that the Love
of _GOD_ is both the first and the last, the Beginning and the End, the
Foundation and the Top-work, the Principle and the Accomplishment of all Moral
Perfection. And no doubt but the first Devoir which in Order of Conception we
can suppose to result from the Being of an intelligent Creature will be to love
the Author of it, and if he who is the Author of our Being be also the Author of
all the Good, Comfort, Pleasure and Happiness of our Being, nay even of our very
Power and Force of loving, then as we begin with him so we must end with him
too, and make him the Term and Object of our whole Love, uniting our selves to
him with all that we are (as when Bodies touch one another according to their
whole Superficies) with all our Heart, Soul and Mind. But of this already, and
perhaps further hereafter. At present I consider that since our Being is in it
self a Good, and the Foundation and Possibility of all the Good which we do or
shall ever enjoy, it can be no sooner received than it brings along with it an
Obligation of loving our Creator, whose we are, and to whom we are to offer up
our Hearts as a flaming Sacrifice as soon as we enter upon Being, which we are
to pay to him as our first Homage, and as an early Pledge and Earnest of all the
Duty that we owe him. And that which does the more oblige us to this is, that if
we do not thus early pay it to our Creator, we shall pay it somewhere else where
it is not due. For no sooner does a Creature begin to be, but he begins to love,
the intellectual Pulse commences its Movement which the first Inspiration of
Life as well as the natural, and the Desire of Happiness immediately succeeds
the Capacity of it. as soon as we _are_ we desire to be happy, and as soon as we
desire to be happy we must seek for this Happiness in some Object or other. If
therefore we seek it not in _GOD,_ we must seek it in the Creature. But if we
seek it out of _GOD,_ we seek it where it is not, and we err and transgress in
our Search, _GOD_ only being our true Good. We are therefore obliged to seek
Union with _GOD_ as soon as we desire to be happy, that is, as soon as we desire
at all, that is, as soon as we are. Our Obligation therefore to love _GOD_ bears
Date from the first Moment of our Existence, and is therefore the first Duty
that we owe him, as thus immediately resulting from our having a Being. And thus
is the Love of _GOD_ the first Commandment, and has the Precedency in the Scale
of Morality.

{#7} The other Character that our Saviour gives of it is, that 'tis also the
Great Commandment. And the Scripture speaks of its Dimensions, adding one more
than we attribute to Bodies, telling us of its Breadth and Length, and Depth and
Height; but not how broad, nor how long, nor how deep, nor how high. And indeed
with what Line could the Apostle measure such an immense Vastness? How could he
Paint Light and Flame, or put that into Words which passes not only all
Description, but even all Knowledg, and indeed every thing but Sense and
Experience. Well might our Saviour call it the Great Commandment. It is great in
the Matter of it, being of the most weighty and concerning importance to the
final Happiness of Man. Great in the Obligation of it which is absolutely
indispensable, it being not possible that _GOD_ should Create any one Spirit
without obliging him to Love him, or that he should ever discharge him from that
Obligation. Great in the Equity and Reason of it, it being highly reasonable
that we should Love _GOD_ who is so infinitely amiable, so altogether lovely.
Great in the Power and Virtue of it, as being the most Fruitful and Prolifick
Principle, the Root and Seed of all Excellency and Perfection, such as draws on
with it the Observation of all the Commandments, and is therefore the shortest
Line, the most compendious way to _GOD_ and the enjoyment of him. The Love of
GOD is indeed the general seisin, the universal ingredient of all a good Man's
Actions; 'Tis that precious Tincture, that Chymical Spirit that runs through
all, and that Noble Divine Elixir which gives Worth and Value to all, and
converts even our meanest and most indifferent actions into Religion and
Devotion. Great lastly, in the Pleasure and Duration of it. As Love is the most
pleasant Passion, so the Love of GOD is the most pleasing Love. A Love that
rewards it self, a Fire that is its own Fuel. He that Loves GOD as he ought, as
he cannot, so he need not Love any thing else, so great delight and
entertainment will he find in the Love of GOD. Which will also go along with him
into the other Life, and be the Life of that Life. Then all the instrumental and
ministerial Virtues shall expire and be of no further Use. _Whether they be
Prophecies they shall fail,_ &c. Even the Fear of GOD which is now so highly
magnified as the Beginning of Wisdom, shall then cease, for perfect Love shall
cast it out. Faith shall vanish, Hope shall be swallowed up, and Prayer it self
shall be silent, only Love and Praise shall endure, and vie with each other to
all Eternity. Thus much of the Love of GOD in general, concerning which all I
have said seems little when I compare it with the Greatness of the Subject, and
your most exalted and seraphick Strains upon it. I intend in my next to add
something to the Reason of our loving GOD so intirely as I state it in my
Sermon. In the mean time I deliver up this noble Subject to a better Hand,
desiring you to communicate what further thoughts you have upon it, and to
believe him that writes this to be in all Sincerity //
