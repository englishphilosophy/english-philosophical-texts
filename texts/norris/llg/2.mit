£2 LETTER II. £2
£2 _Mr. _Norris's_ Answer._ £2

{#1} THough in Civility to your Person, my Answer ought to have been more
speedy, yet considering the weight of your Letter, I think it cannot be well too
slow, and I hope you will in Equity, allow me some time to recover my self out
of that wonder I was cast into, to see such a Letter from a Woman, besides what
was necessary to consider the great and surprising Contents of it. I find you
throughly comprehend the Argument of my Discourse, in that you have pitch'd upon
the only material Objection to which it is liable; which you have also press'd
so well, and so very home, that I can't but greatly admire the Light and
Penetration of your Spirit. One of your clear and exact thoughts might easily
satisfie your self in any Difficulty that shall come in your way, as having
brightness enough of your own to dispel any Cloud that may set upon the Face of
Truth; but however, since you have condescended to apply your self to me for
Satisfaction, I shall endeavour as well as I can to solve the Difficulty you
propose.

{#2} I observe therefore first of all, that you grant the two main things
contended for, _viz._ _That God is the only Efficient Cause of all our
Sensations_; and that by the Letter of the Commandment, _GOD ought to be the
Sole Object of our Love_. Only you say, that the Reason I assign for it seems
not equally Clear, by which I suppose you mean, that it does not seem to follow
from God's being the only Cause of our Sensations, that he is the only Object of
our Love; Or, that GOD is not therefore the only Object of our Love, because he
is the only Cause of our Sensations; that is in short, you grant the things, but
you question the Connexion.

{#3} Now before I consider the Objection you urge against it, give me leave to
tell you that I think it very clear, That not Absolute, but Relative Good is the
Formal Object of our Love; that is, that we love a thing not as it is good in it
self, but as 'tis good to us; and consequently, GOD is the Object of our Love,
not as he is absolutely, but as he is Relatively Good, as he is our Good, or
Good to us. For to Love GOD is to desire him as our Good. I do not deny but that
the Absolute goodness of GOD, the Natural Perfection of his Essence, is also the
true Object of our Love; but not as Absolute, but as Relative; that is, not as
tis a Perfection in him, but as the same may be a Perfection to us, as it makes
us more happy by the Pleasure that we take either in the Contemplation, or in
the Fruition of so glorious and excellent a Being. So that the absolute
Perfection of GOD must become relative before it can be the Object of our Love.

{#4} Indeed, when in thinking upon GOD, we consider nothing but an infinite
Reality or Perfection, we are ready to acknowledg that Order requires we should
_esteem_ him infinitely. But from this alone we do not necessarily conclude that
we should adore him, fear him, love him, _&c._ GOD considered only in himself,
or without any Relation to us, does not excite those movements of the Soul which
transport it to Good, or to the Cause of its Happiness. Nothing indeed is more
clear, than that a Being infinitely Perfect, ought to be infinitely _Esteem'd_;
and I am apt to believe, that there is no Spirit that can refuse _GOD_ this
speculative Devoir, as consisting only in a simple Judgment, which is not in our
power to suspend when the Evidence is intire. So that even wicked Men, those who
have no Religion, those who deny Providence, may be suppos'd voluntarily to
render _GOD_ this sort of Devoir. But then supposing withall, that _GOD_ (how
perfect and good soever in himself) does not at all interess or concern himself
with us or our Affairs; and that he is not the true and immediate Cause of all
the good which they enjoy, notwithstanding the Notion they have of the Absolute
Perfection of _GOD_, they consider him not as their good, and accordingly do not
apply themselves to the Love of him, but brutally follow the agreeable movements
of their Passions. From all which it is is clear, that _GOD_ is to be loved not
for his Absolute, but for his Relative goodness.

{#5} Now if it be true in the general, that Relative good is the Object of Love,
and that _GOD_ is to be lov'd as, and because he is our _good_, then it will
follow, that if _GOD_ only be our _good_, or the Author of _good_ to us, then
_GOD_ only is to be lov'd by us. And so the other way, that if _GOD_ only be to
be lov'd by us, it must be, it can be upon no other account than as and because
he only is our _good_, as being the only true Cause of our Pleasure. And I
cannot imagine upon what other ground you can cast our Obligation to love _GOD_
only, (which you grant to be the literal import of the Commandment) if not upon
this, that he only is our _good_. For as the reason why we are to Love _GOD_ at
all, is because he is our _good_, so the reason why we are to Love him only
(which supposition you grant) can be no other, but because he only is our
_good_. And since he cannot be our only _good_ any otherwise, than as he is the
only true Cause of our Pleasure, it follows, that his being the only true Cause
of our Pleasure, is the true reason why he ought to be the only Object of our
Love. This I think, is clear and evident, and therefore though I should rest
here, as not being able to Answer all the Objections to the contrary, this ought
not to be any prejudice to the Truth of what is maintain'd. For this I take to
be a sure Rule, that we are to stick to what we clearly see, notwithstanding any
Objection that may be brought against it, and not reject what is evident, for
the sake of what is obscure, it being very possible for a Man to be in sure and
certain possession of a Truth, though attended with some Difficulties which he
knows not well how to solve. But let us see whether yours are of that Nature.

{#6} You say, if we must Love nothing but what is Lovely, and nothing be Lovely
but what is our _good_, and nothing is our _good_ but what does us _good_, and
nothing does us _good_ but what causes Pleasure in us, may we not by the same
way of arguing prove, that what causes Pain in us does not do us _good_, and
therefore can't be our _good_; and if not our _good_ then not Lovely, and
consequently is not the proper, much less the only Object of our Love? True, it
is not so far as it causes Pain; for the causing of Pain as such, can be no
reason of Love. But I suppose your meaning is, whether we may not by the same
way of arguing prove, that what causes Pain is not at all the Object of Love? To
which I Answer, That if that which causes Pain does it in all respects after the
same manner as it causes Pleasure, the causing of Pain will, for ought I can at
present see to the contrary, be as good an Argument for its not being to be
lov'd, as its causing Pleasure is for its being to be loved. But thus it is not
in the present Supposition. Though I acknowledge Pain to be as truly the Effect
of GOD as Pleasure (for I know not what else shou'd cause it) yet it is not
after the same manner the Effect of GOD as Pleasure is. Pleasure is the natural,
genuine and direct Effect of GOD, but Pain comes from him only indirectly and by
Accident. For first, 'tis of the proper Nature of GOD to produce Pleasure, as
consisting of such essential Excellencies and Perfections as will necessarily
beatifie and make happy those Spirits, who are, by being in their true rational
Order, duly dispos'd for the Enjoyment of him. But if this same excellent Nature
occasion Pain to other Spirits, this is only indirectly and by Accident, by
reason of their Moral Indisposition for so Sovereign a Good. Again, as 'tis thus
in Reference to the Nature of GOD, so in Reference to his Will. GOD's antecedent
and primary Design is the Happiness of all his Creatures (for 'twas for this
that he made them) but if any of them, in the event prove miserable, 'tis wholly
besides his first Design, and only by a subsequent and secondary Will. Again,
when GOD causes Pleasure, 'tis because he wills it for its self, and naturally
delights in it, as comporting with his primary Design which is the Happiness of
his Creatures; but when he causes Pain, 'tis not that he wills it from within,
or for it self (for so 'tis not at all lovely) but only from without, and for
the sake of something else as it is necessary to the Order of his Justice. For
you are to consider, that if there had been no Sin, there wou'd never have been
such a thing as Pain, which is a plain Argument that GOD wills our Pleasure as
we are Creatures, and our Pain only as we are Sinners. But now in measuring our
Devoirs to _GOD_, we are not to consider how he stands affected to us as
sinners, but how he stands affected to us as Creatures, how he is disposed
towards us as we are _his_ Work, and not as we have made our selves. And
therefore if as Creatures he Loves us, and Wills our Happiness, that lays a
sufficient Foundation for our Love to him; and 'tis not his treating us with
Evil as sinners that can overturn it.

{#7} Indeed if _GOD_ had designed us for misery, and inflicted it upon us as
Creatures, if this had been his primary and direct Intention, his Natural and
Original Will, according to the systeme of those who say, _That GOD made Man on
purpose to Damn them_, then indeed I see nothing that should hinder your
Objection from taking place, _GOD_ would not then be the proper, much less (as
you say) the only Object of our Love, at least as to those miserable Wretches so
destin'd to Ruin, which by the way is to me a Demonstration of the falshood of
that strange Hypothesis. But upon the supposition, that _GOD_ wills and causes
Pleasure in us as Creatures, and puts us to Pain only as Sinners, there will not
be the same reason for our not loving him upon the account of his being the
Author of our Pain, as for our loving him as the Author of our Pleasure and
Happiness. For we stand obliged to _GOD_ as we are Creatures, and if in that
Relation _GOD_ be our Benefactor, and the Author of our _good_, he has a
sufficient Right; and, if the only Author, the only Right to our Love, though as
sinners he puts us to pain, which being thus will'd and effected by _GOD_ after
a manner so different from our _pleasure_, cannot so well conclude for our not
loving him, as this does for our loving him. Which may serve to take off the
force of your first Instance.

{#8} And will be equally applicable to your second. For whereas you further
urge, that if both these Sensations, (_viz. Pleasure_ and _Pain_) be produced by
the same _Cause_, then that Cause is at once the Object of our Love and of our
Aversion: I answer by the same Distinction, that if both these Sensations were
to be produc'd by the same _Cause_, acting alike in the one as in the other, it
would be as you say. But since it is otherwise as I have represented it, all
that you can argue from _GOD_'s being the Author of our _Pain_ as well as
_Pleasure_ will be this, That he is justly to be the Object of our Fear, but not
of our Aversion. We are indeed to Fear him, and him only, as being the _true
Cause_ of all _Pain_, and only able to make us miserable, according to that of
our Saviour, _I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear, &c._ But this is no reason
why we should hate him, as never inflicting it but when Order and Justice
require it. And if he did not inflict it then he would be less perfect, and
consequently less amiable in the view of all regular and well-order'd Spirits. I
shall not determine any thing concerning the Case of the Damn'd, whether that
invincible Love which they have for Happiness may not inspire them with an
invincible hatred against him who is the Cause of their Misery. Perhaps it may
be so. Though whether it should be so, and whether they do not sin Eternally in
so doing is another Question. But I shall determine nothing here, thinking it
sufficient for my present purpose, that this is no reason why _GOD_ should be
the Object of any Mans Aversion in this Life, whom as the Author of Pain we are
indeed to Fear, but not to Hate, for the reasons before alledged.

{#9} Now as to your last Instance, That if these Principles, _viz._ _That GOD is
the Efficient Cause of our Sensations, Pain as well as Pleasure_, and that he is
to be the _only Object of our Love_, be firm and true, it will then follow,
either that the being the Cause of our Pleasure (the doing us good you should
say to make a right Antithesis) is not the true and proper reason why that
_Cause_ should be the Object of our Love, or else if it be, then something else
does us Good besides that which causes our Pleasure; or as you otherwise word
it, That which causes Pain does us good as well as that which produces Pleasure,
I think neither of these Consequences need be admitted. Not the First, because I
have shewn you, That God's being the Cause of our Pleasure is a sufficient and
proper reason why he should be the Object of our Love, notwithstanding that Pain
which is also, but after a different manner caus'd by him. As to what you
suggest to the contrary, namely, That the Author of our Pain has as good a Title
to our Love as the Author of our Pleasure: 'Tis true, he that is the Author of
our Pain has as good a Title to it as the Author of our Pleasure, because they
are both one and the same; but not as he is the Author of our Pain. He has a
Title to our Love not _for_ that, but _notwithstanding_ that. 'Tis his being the
cause of our Pleasure that makes him the proper Object of our Love; which he is,
notwithstanding his being also the Author of Pain. But then say you, if his
doing us good be the reason of his being the Object of our Love, then something
else does us good besides that which causes our Pleasure, namely Pain, the Cause
of our Sensations, Pain as well as Pleasure being the Object of our Love. I
answer, Pain may in some sense be said to do us good, as it may occasion to us
some good that exceeds its own proper Evil. But formally and directly it does
not do us good, as not making us while actually under it, Happy but Miserable.
Nor is there need that upon our Supposition it should, God being sufficiently
lovely to us as the Author of our _Pleasure_, to which we need not add the
advantage that may accrue by _Pain_, or suppose _Pain_ to be in it self as
Beneficial as _Pleasure_, 'tis enough if the Evil of the former does not
frustrate the Obligation that arises from the good of the latter. As I have
shewn you that it does not

{#10} But after all Madam, there is one thing I must further offer to your
Consideration, _viz._ That your Objection, whatever force it may have, is not
peculiarly levell'd against me, but lies equally against all those who make the
loveliness of God to consist in his Relative Goodness, or in his being our Good,
who I think are the most, at least the most considerable. Those of the common
way say, God is to be lov'd because he is our Good, or the Author of our Good;
which Notion I think right, but only add to it, That he is the only Author of
our Good, and therefore the only Object of our Love. In which Argument I
suppose, these Men would not deny the Consequence, (as being the same with their
own) but only the minor Proposition. But now if it be an Objection against my
Notion, That God is also the Author of Evil, then the same will no less conclude
against the common way, proving as much that God ought not to be lov'd at all,
as that he ought not to be lov'd only. I say it proves one as well as the other,
though I think if you will attend to what I have offer'd, you will find that it
proves neither.

{#11} Madam, I have said all that at present occurs to my Thoughts upon this
occasion, and I think as much as is necessary, and have now only to thank you
for the great Favour of your Letter, assuring you that whenever you shall be
pleas'd to do me that Honour again, you shall have a speedier Answer from //
_____Madam_, //
__Your very humble Servant #Bemerton, Oct. 13. 1693.# //
______^=J. Norris=^.

{#12} ONE consideration more. When you speak of _GOD_'s being the cause of Pain,
either you mean as to this Life, or as to the next. If as to the next, that has
nothing to do with the Duty that we owe him here. If as to the present Life, the
pain that God inflicts upon us here is only Medicinal, and in order to our
greater good, and consequently from a Principle of Kindness. And I think,
setting aside my other Considerations, there will be no more pretence for not
loving or hating God for this, than for hating our Physitian or Surgeon for
putting us to pain in order to our Health or Cure.
