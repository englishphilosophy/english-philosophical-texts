  {
    text: "<i>Hume Texts Online</i> was an invaluable resource for me when writing my book on Hume, to be published by Princeton University Press in 2021. To have a wider range of such texts available at <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> would vastly improve the ability of academics and writers around the world to conduct their research more easily and more thoroughly.",

    text: "I am writing you to express my support to the project <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i>. I am an Argentinian Hume scholar and the site <i>Hume Texts Online</i> was of immense help during the writing of my PhD Dissertation back in 2016-2017. To count on accurate editions of essential philosophical works such as Hume’s, Locke’s, Berkeley’s and other Enlightenment figures is of the utmost relevance for our daily research. This is especially so in my case, because due to the vulnerable situation of my country, it is difficult to access quality editions of this great philosopher’s writings. Thank you very much, and congratulations for running such an amazing and useful website.",

    text: "<i>Hume Texts Online</i> is an indispensable resource for students and scholars of Hume’s thought. Its combination of comprehensive, accurate texts and an extremely powerful search engine have enormously improved the quality of scholarly research on Hume. I have used it every working day for several years, and I enthusiastically recommend it to my students. <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> promises even greater benefits to an even greater number of students and scholars. I am excited to see this new project develop.",

    text: "I’m extremely grateful to you for your work on <i>Hume Texts Online</i>. I used the website almost every day during the years I was writing my dissertation on Hume. The website is so beautifully designed and easy to use that I would use it even though I often had print copies of Hume with me; it was of course also very convenient to be able to access Hume’s texts on the go. I will definitely be making a lot of use of <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> in my teaching and research. It would be especially helpful for teaching, as a way of assigning easy-to-access readings to students. I am often hesitant to assign online content to students because often it is not properly edited and has no page numbers, but <i>Hume Texts Online</i> avoids all these issues. This semester I had a student in my early modern class who had a visual disability, and I had some difficulty finding OCR-enabled content for some of the readings (especially of lesser known early modern figures). The website would be an excellent resource for teachers and students in similar situations.",

    text: "This project is a real blessing to those focusing their research on the philosophical legacy of English-speaking authors. The extremely refined and constantly improving search functions of <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> improve scholarly productivity much more than standard electronic resources can. Beyond this primary virtue, this project will prove outright indispensable to scholars and students who can rely only on impoverished research infrastructures, and have limited access to critical editions and electronic resources.",

    text: "I would like to express my support for both <i>Hume Texts Online</i> and <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i>. As a researcher writing on Hume, I use the former on an almost daily basis to search Hume’s texts and find paragraph numbers for universal citations. I applaud this new project to include texts from across the whole English philosophical canon, and expect that the completion of this project will increase the efficiency and amount of scholarship on underrepresented figures from that canon.",

    text: "As someone teaching in a philosophy department in Central Europe, I see this is a priceless resource. It promises to enable researchers and students to access works of philosophers, many of which are not easy to track down in libraries in Prague. The search features are a great help in navigating the texts and penetrating them for specific themes. We have found the sister site Hume Texts Online very useful too, and it has played its part in the current surge of interest in Hume’s thought in Czechia.",

    text: "Just writing to say that I have found the resources at <i>Hume Texts Online</i> excellent in support of teaching and research. Firstly, it is extremely helpful to have well-managed versions of these texts online – this makes it very easy for students to access the material without concerns about copyright. I am about to teach an online only course on this material, taken by international students, and <i>Hume Texts Online</i> will be even more useful in this regard. Secondly, I love it that this resource makes this material available for free and for everyone with access to the internet – there are plenty of people out there who are interested in this material, and it is great to be able to point them (or have google point them) to texts that are freely available and edited and curated by excellent scholars in the field. I wholeheartedly approve of the proposal to expand this resource to cover more early modern texts (and more!).",

  {
    text: "Please allow me to express my enthusiastic support for the continued development of <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i>. As a teacher, I deeply value the way this resource brings foundational texts into the hands of students who are under increasing economic pressure due to the rising costs of higher education at absolutely no cost to them. As a scholar, I have come to rely on <i>Hume Texts Online</i> to get virtually every project going. As the Executive Vice President of the Hume Society, I delight in seeing a room full of Hume scholars from across the world and across generations collectively using this tool at conferences to figure out exactly what Hume said in a particular text, whether he used a particular word or phrase, etc. <i>English Philosophical Texts Online</i> and <i>Hume Texts Online</i> make doing the history of philosophy easier, more collaborative, and more egalitarian. It represents the best we hope for in the digital humanities.",

    text: "Thank you for your wonderful work on <i>Hume Texts Online</i>. I have been using this resource regularly for many years, and I can say that it is one of the best sites for online philosophical texts, both for the ease of consultation and the accuracy of the presentation of the texts. I hope the project will extend to include other authors like Toland, Collins, Bolingbroke, that I have been studying in the last years.",

  {
    text: "<i>Hume Texts Online</i> has transformed Hume scholarship. No need now to speed read passages of tattered volumes to find where Hume said such and such; no need to pack those tattered volumes for conference trips; no need tentatively to suggest to students that if they were to buy one Hume text for their course, they could go for a second-hand copy of…. The proposal to cover a wider range of early modern texts in English in a similar way is tremendously exciting.",

Some of the texts covered here may be found on the Liberty Fund’s <i>Online Library of Liberty</i>, but only some, and their site is not the most user-friendly. I look forward to being able to do sophisticated searches and comparative textual analysis at <i>EPTO</i>, and I will have my spring 2020 students in eighteenth-century British literature (along with some philosophy) read parts of Mandeville’s <i>Fable</i> at this new resource.",

My students are all studying for degrees in health sciences, and must also take one term of a humanities subject. Many of them struggle financially and try to get by without buying the books they need. I have about 20 students currently using the texts at <i>Hume Texts Online</i>. Free and reliable online texts make a significant difference in their education and serve to minimize the differences between those who can afford to buy books and those who cannot.",

This project, when completed, will not only make available texts which many of us know, but have difficulty accessing; it will also make texts available, especially regarding female thinkers of the period you are covering, which have hitherto been unknown to many of us. The value of your project has no time limit: it will serve scholars for as long as there is interest and scholarship in the English Philosophical Texts you are covering. Your project constitutes a major breakthrough for scholarship of the period. I am hopeful that you will receive the full funding you have requested to enable you to carry this project through to completion.",

    text: "I am immensely grateful for <i>Hume Texts Online</i>. As a lecturer on a new philosophy programme at a small department, directing students to scholarly editions of classic texts is sometimes a challenge. My students have benefited enormously from the ability to access high quality versions of Hume’s entire philosophical output with proper citation tools at a single site. I also have later-in-life and distance research students for whom this resource is perhaps even more valuable. It should be added that apart from being an extremely good idea, <i>Hume Texts Online</i> has been admirably executed: the texts are visually pleasing, they load immediately, and they can be searched quickly and with ease. This distinguishes <i>Hume Texts Online</i> from many online text resources which, in addition to charging for the service, tend to use awkward bandwidth-heavy viewing platforms. It would be wonderful to see this outstanding project expanded.",

So many of the texts you are proposing to include are not readily available to potential researchers, especially those working outside major research universities and/or library collections.
