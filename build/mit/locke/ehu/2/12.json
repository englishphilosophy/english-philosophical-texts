The copytext for this version is the 4th edition of 1700, which is the last edition to be printed in Locke’s lifetime, and contains several changes and additions. The text is derived from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP. Several changes are being made to this source, to bring the text in line with the 1700 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A48874.0001.001/1:7.12?rgn=div2;view=fulltext","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£1 CHAP. XII. £1 £2 _Of complex _Ideas_._ £2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"WE have hitherto considered those _Ideas,_ in the reception whereof, the Mind is only passive, which are those simple ones received from _Sensation_ and _Reflection_ before-mentioned, whereof the Mind cannot make any one to it self, nor have any _Idea_ which does not wholy consist of them. But as these simple _Ideas_ are observed to exist in several Combinations united together; so the Mind has a power to consider several of them united together, as one _Idea_; and that not only as they are united in external Objects, but as it self has joined them. _Ideas_ thus made up of several simple ones put together, I call _Complex_; such as are _Beauty, Gratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe_; which though complicated of various simple _Ideas,_ or _complex Ideas,_ made up of simple ones, yet are, when the Mind pleases, considered each by it self, as one entire thing, and signified by one name.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In this faculty of repeating and joining together its _Ideas,_ the Mind has great power in varying and multiplying the Objects of its Thoughts, infinitely beyond what _Sensation_ or _Reflection_ furnished it with: But all this still confined to those simple _Ideas,_ which it received from those two Sources, and which are the ultimate Materials of all its Compositions. For these, they are all from things themselves; and _the Mind can_ have no more, nor other simple _Ideas,_ than as they are suggested to it. It can have no other _Ideas_ of sensible Qualities, than what come from without by the Senses; nor any _Ideas_ of other kind of Operations of a thinking Substance, than what it finds in it self: but when it has once got those simple _Ideas,_ it is not confined barely to Observation, and what offers it self from without, it can, by its own power, put together those _Ideas_ it has, and _make new complex ones,_ which it never received so united.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Complex Ideas,_ however compounded and decompounded, though their number be infinite, and the variety endless, wherewith they fill, and and entertain the Thoughts of Men; yet, I think, they may be all reduced under these three Heads: //_Modes._ //_Substances._ //_Relations._","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"First, _Modes_ I call such complex _Ideas,_ which however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as Dependences on, or Affections of Substances; such are the _Ideas_ signified by the words _Triangle, Gratitude, Murther, &c._ and if in this I use the word _Mode,_ in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in Discourses, differing from the ordinary received Notions, either to make new Words, or to use old Words in somewhat a new signification; which in our present case, is perhaps the more tolerable of the two.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of these _Modes,_ there are two sorts, which deserve distinct consideration. First, There are some which are only variations, or different combinations of the same simple _Idea,_ without the mixture of any other, as a dozen, or score; which are nothing but the _Ideas_ of so many distinct Unites added together, and these I call _simple Modes,_ as being contained within the bounds of one simple _Idea._ Secondly, There are others compounded of simple _Ideas_ of several kinds, put together to make one complex one; _v. g. Beauty,_ consisting of a certain composition of Colour and Figure, causing delight in the Beholder; _Theft,_ which being the concealed change of the possession of any thing, without the consent of the Proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several _Ideas_ of several kinds; and these I call _mixed Modes._","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Secondly, The _Ideas_ of _Substances_ are such combinations of simple _Ideas,_ as are taken to represent distinct particular things subsisting by themselves; in which the supposed, or confused _Idea_ of Substance, such as it is, is always the first and chief. Thus if to Substance be joined the simple _Idea_ of a certain dull whitish colour, with certain degrees of Weight, Hardness, Ductility, and Fusibility, we have the _Idea_ of _Lead_; and a combination of the _Ideas_ of a certain sort of Figure, with the powers of Motion, Thought, and Reasoning, joined to Substance, make the ordinary _Idea_ of _a Man._ Now of Substances also, there are two sorts of _Ideas_; one of single Substances, as they exist separately, as of _a Man, or a Sheep_; the other of several of those put together, as an _Army_ of Men, or _Flock_ of Sheep; which _collective Ideas of_ several _Substances_ thus put together, are as much each of them one single _Idea,_ as that of a Man, or an Unite.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thirdly, The last sort of complex _Ideas,_ is that we call _Relation,_ which consists in the consideration and comparing one _Idea_ with another, of these several kinds, we shall treat in their order.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If we will trace the progress of our Minds, and with attention observe how it repeats, adds together, and unites its simple _Ideas_ received from Sensation or Reflection, it will lead us farther than at first, perhaps, we should have imagined. And, I believe, we shall find, if we warily observe the Originals of our Notions, that even _the most abstruse Ideas,_ how remote soever they may seem from Sense, or any operation of our own Minds, are yet only such as the Understanding frames to it self, by repeating and joining together _Ideas,_ that it had either from Objects of Sense, or its own operations about them: So that those even large _and abstract Ideas are derived from Sensation, or Reflection,_ being no other than what the Mind by the ordinary use of its own Faculties, employ'd about _Ideas_ received from Objects of Sense, or the Operations it observes in it self about them, may, and does attain unto. This I shall endeavour to shew in the _Ideas_ we have of _Space, Time,_ and _Infinity,_ and some few other, that seem the most remote from those Originals.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.2.12.8"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Locke","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":1689,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Locke.LT1","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"First Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"First Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TG","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Two Treatises of Government","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Two Treatises of Government"},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.LT2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.LT3","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1692],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TCE","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Some Thoughts Concerning Education","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1693],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Thoughts Concerning Education"},{"id":"Locke.RC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VRC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity from Mr. Edwards's Reflections","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VC2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Second Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1697],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Vindication of Christianity"}]},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.EHU.2","imported":true,"title":"Book 2.
