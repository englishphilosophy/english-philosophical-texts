Whether it be so or no, I am content the Reader shou'd impartially Examine. Since I do not think my self any farther concern'd for the Success of what I have Written, than as it is agreeable to _Truth_. But to the end _This_ may not suffer, I make it my Request that the Reader suspend his Judgment, till he has once, _at least_, read the whole through with that degree of Attention and Thought which the subject Matter shall seem to deserve. For as there are some Passages that, taken by themselves, are very liable (nor cou'd it be remedied) to gross Misinterpretation, and to be charged with most absurd Consequences, which, nevertheless, upon an intire perusal will appear not to follow from them: So likewise, thô the whole shou'd be read over, yet, if this be done Transiently, 'tis very probable my Sense may be mistaken; but to a Thinking Reader, I flatter my self, it will be throughout Clear and Obvious. As for the Characters of Novelty and Singularity, which some of the following Notions may seem to bear, 'tis, I hope, needless to make any Apology on that account. He must surely be either very weak, or very little acquainted with the Sciences, who shall reject a Truth, that is capable of Demonstration, for no other Reason but because it's newly known and contrary to the Prejudices of Mankind. Thus much I thought fit to premise, in order to prevent, if possible, the hasty Censures of a sort of Men, who are too apt to condemn an Opinion before they rightly comprehend it._","subId":"1","id":"Berkeley.THK.Pref.1"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Berkeley","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":1709,"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Berkeley.ETV","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1709],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Towards a Theory of Vision"},{"id":"Berkeley.THK","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1710],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise Concerning Human Knowledge"},{"id":"Berkeley.PO","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Passive Obedience","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1712],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Passive Obedience"},{"id":"Berkeley.DHP","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1713],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous"},{"id":"Berkeley.A","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Alciphron; or, the Minute Philosopher","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1732],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Alciphron"},{"id":"Berkeley.TV","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"The Theory of Vision","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1733],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Theory of Vision"},{"id":"Berkeley.Q","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"The Querist","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1735],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Querist"}]},{"id":"Berkeley.THK","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1710],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise Concerning Human Knowledge"}],"prev":{"id":"Berkeley.THK.Ded","imported":true,"title":"Dedication","breadcrumb":"Dedication","published":[1710]},"next":{"id":"Berkeley.THK.Intro","imported":true,"title":"Introduction","breadcrumb":"Introduction","published":[1710]}}
