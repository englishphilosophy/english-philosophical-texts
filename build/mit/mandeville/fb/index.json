In 1714, he published the poem again, together with a preface, _An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue_, and several _Remarks_ on the poem, all under the title of _The Fable of the Bees_. Our copytext is the 3rd edition of 1724, to which two additional essays were added. The text here derives from F. B.
