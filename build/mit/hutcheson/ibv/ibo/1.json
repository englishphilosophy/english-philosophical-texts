Thus _Seeing_ and _Hearing_ denote the different Powers of receiving the Ideas of Colours and Sounds. And altho' Colours have great Differences among themselves, as also have Sounds; yet there is a greater Agreement among the most opposite Colours, than between any Colour and a Sound: Hence we call all Colours Perceptions of the same Sense. All the several Senses seem to have their distinct Organs, except _Feeling_, which is in some degree diffus'd over the whole Body.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#The Mind how active.# ^The^ Mind has a Power of _compounding_ Ideas, which were receiv'd separately; of _comparing_ their Objects by means of the Ideas, and of observing their _Relations_ and _Proportions_; of _enlarging_ and _diminishing_ its Ideas at pleasure, or in any certain _Ratio_, or Degree; and of considering _separately_ each of the simple Ideas, which might perhaps have been impress'd jointly in the Sensation. This last Operation we commonly call _Abstraction_.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Substances.# ^The^ Ideas of _Corporeal Substances_ are compounded of the various simple Ideas jointly impress'd, when they presented themselves to our Senses. We define Substances only by enumerating these sensible Ideas: And such Definitions may raise a clear enough Idea of the Substance in the Mind of one who never immediately perceiv'd the Substance; provided he has separately receiv'd by his Senses all the simple Ideas which are in the Composition of the complex one of the Substance defin'd: But if there be any simple Ideas which he has not receiv'd, or if he wants any of the Senses necessary for the Perception of them, no Definition can raise any simple Idea which has not been before perceived by the _Senses_.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Education.

This will appear from reflecting on those Objects, to which we have now an Aversion, tho' they were formerly agreeable: And we shall generally find that there is some accidental _Conjunction_ of a disagreeable Idea, which always recurs with the Object; as in those Wines to which Men acquire an Aversion, after they have taken them in an Emetick Preparation: In this case we are conscious that the _Idea_ is alter'd from what it was when that Wine was agreeable, by the Conjunction of the Ideas of Loathing and Sickness of Stomach. The like Change of _Idea_ may be insensibly made by the Change of our Bodys as we advance in Years, or when we are accustomed to any Object, which may occasion an Indifference toward Meats we were fond of in our Childhood; and may make some Objects cease to raise the disagreeable Ideas, which they excited upon our first use of them. Many of our simple Perceptions are disagreeable only thro' the too great _Intenseness_ of the Quality: thus moderate Light is agreeable, very strong Light may be painful; moderate Bitter may be pleasant, a higher Degree may be offensive. A Change in our Organs will necessarily occasion a Change in the Intenseness of the Perception at least; nay sometimes will occasion a quite contrary Perception: Thus a warm Hand shall feel that Water cold, which a cold hand shall feel warm.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^We^ shall not find it perhaps so easy to account for the Diversity of Fancy about more _complex Ideas_ of Objects, including many Ideas of different Senses at once; as in some Perceptions of those call'd _primary Qualitys_, and some _secondary_, as explain'd by =Mr. ^Locke^=: for instance, in the different Fancys about _Architecture_, _Gardening_, _Dress_. Of the two former we shall offer something in [Sect. VI.] As to _Dress_, we may generally account for the Diversity of Fancys from a like Conjunction of Ideas: Thus, if either from any thing in Nature, or from the Opinion of our Country or Acquaintance, the fancying of _glaring Colours_ be look'd upon as an evidence of Levity, or of any other evil Quality of Mind; or if any _Colour or Fashion_ be commonly us'd by Rusticks, or by Men of any disagreeable Profession, Employment, or Temper; these additional Ideas may recur constantly with that of the _Colour_ or _Fashion_, and cause a constant Dislike to them in those who join the additional Ideas, altho' the Colour or Form be no way disagreeable of themselves, and actually do please others who join no such Ideas to them. But there appears no Ground to believe such a Diversity in human Minds, as that the same simple Idea or Perception should give pleasure to one and pain to another, or to the same Person at different times; not to say that it seems a Contradiction, that the same simple Idea should do so.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Complex Ideas.# ^The^ only Pleasure of Sense, which many Philosophers seem to consider, is that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation: But there are far greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of Objects, which obtain the Names of _Beautiful_, _Regular_, _Harmonious_. Thus every one acknowledges he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture, than with the View of any one Colour, were it as strong and lively as possible; and more pleas'd with a Prospect of the Sun arising among settled Clouds, and colouring their Edges, with a starry Hemisphere, a fine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear blue Sky, a smooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify'd by Woods, Hills, Waters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are not quite _simple_.

I should rather chuse to call our Power of perceiving these Ideas, an ^Internal Sense^, were it only for the Convenience of distinguishing them from other Sensations of Seeing and Hearing, which men may have without Perception of _Beauty_ and _Harmony_. It is plain from Experience, that many Men have, in the common meaning, the Senses of Seeing and Hearing perfect enough; they perceive all the _simple Ideas_ separately, and have their Pleasures; they distinguish them from each other, such as one Colour from another, either quite different, or the stronger or fainter of the same Colour, when they are plac'd beside each other, altho' they may often confound their _Names_, when they occur apart from each other; as some do the Names of _Green_ and _Blue_: they can tell in separate Notes the _higher_, _lower_, _sharper or flatter_, when separately sounded; in Figures they discern the _Length_, _Breadth_, _Wideness_ of each Line, Surface, Angle; and may be as capable of hearing and seeing at great Distances as any Men whatsoever: And yet perhaps they shall find no Pleasure in Musical Compositions, in Painting, Architecture, natural Landskip; or but a very weak one in comparison of what others enjoy from the same Objects. This greater Capacity of receiving such pleasant Ideas we commonly call a _fine Genius_ or _Taste_: In Musick we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct Sense from the External one of Hearing, and call it a _good Ear_; and the like Distinction we should probably acknowledge in other Objects, had we also got distinct Names to denote these _Powers_ of Perception by.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Different from External.# ^We^ generally imagine the brute Animals endowed with the same sort of Powers of Perception as our _External Senses_, and having sometimes greater Acuteness in them: but we conceive few or none of them with any of these sublimer Powers of Perception here call'd _Internal Senses_; or at least if some of them have them, it is in a Degree much inferior to ours.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^There^ will appear another Reason perhaps afterwards, for calling this Power of perceiving the Ideas of _Beauty_, an _Internal Sense_, from this, that in some other Affairs, where our _External Senses_ are not much concern'd, we discern a sort of Beauty, very like, in many respects, to that observ'd in sensible Objects, and accompany'd with like Pleasure: Such is that _Beauty_ perceiv'd in _Theorems_, or universal Truths, in _general Causes_, and in some _extensive Principles_ of Action.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Let^ one consider, first, That 'tis probably a Being may have the full Power of External Sensation, which we enjoy, so as to perceive each Colour, Line, Surface, as we do; yet, without the Power of _comparing_, or of discerning the _Similitudes_ or Proportions: Again, It might discern these also, and yet have no _Pleasure_ or Delight accompanying these Perceptions. The bare Idea of the Form is something separable from Pleasure, as may appear from the different _Tastes_ of Men about the Beauty of Forms, where we don't imagine that they differ in any Ideas, either of the Primary or Secondary Qualities. _Similitude_, _Proportion_, _Analogy_, or _Equality_ of Proportion, are Objects of the Understanding, and must be actually known before we know the natural Causes of our Pleasure. But _Pleasure_ perhaps is not necessarily connected with the Perception of them: and may be felt where the Proportion is not known or attended to: and may not be felt where the Proportion is observed. Since then there are such different Powers of Perception, where what are commonly called the _External Senses_ are the same; since the most accurate Knowledge of what the External Senses discover, may often not give the Pleasure of Beauty or Harmony, which yet one of a _good Taste_ will enjoy at once without much _Knowledge_; we may justly use another Name for these higher and more delightful Perceptions of Beauty and Harmony, and call the _Power_ of receiving such Impressions, and _Internal Sense_: The Difference of the Perceptions seems sufficient to vindicate the Use of a different Name, especially when we are told in what Meaning the Word is applied.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Its Pleasures necessary and immediate.# ^This^ superior Power of Perception is justly called a _Sense_, because of its Affinity to the other Senses in this, that the Pleasure does not arise from any _Knowledge_ of Principles, Proportions, Causes, or of the Usefulness of the Object; we are struck at the first with the Beauty: nor does the most accurate _Knowledge_ increase this Pleasure of Beauty, however it may superadd a distinct rational Pleasure from prospects of _Advantage_, or may bring along that peculiar kind of Pleasure, which attends the Increase of Knowledge[n1].","subId":"16","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^And^ further, the Ideas of Beauty and Harmony, like other sensible Ideas, are _necessarily_ pleasant to us, as well as immediately so; neither can any Resolution of our own, nor any _Prospect_ of Advantage or Disadvantage, vary the Beauty or Deformity of an Object: For as in the external Sensations, no View of _Interest_ will make an Object grateful, nor View of _Detriment_, distinct from immediate _Pain_ in the Perception, make it disagreeable to the Sense; so propose the whole World as a _Reward_, or _threaten_ the greatest Evil, to make us approve a deform'd Object, or disapprove a beautiful one; Dissimulation may be procur'd by Rewards or Threatnings, or we may in external Conduct abstain from any _Pursuit_ of the Beautiful, and pursue the Deform'd; but our _Sentiments_ of the Forms, and our _Perceptions_, would continue invariably the same.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#This Sense antecedent to and distinct from prospects of interest.# ^Hence^ it plainly appears, \"that some Objects are _immediately_ the Occasions of this Pleasure of Beauty, and that we have Senses fitted for perceiving it; and that it is distinct from that _Joy_ which arises upon Prospect of Advantage.\" Nay, do not we often see Convenience and Use neglected to obtain Beauty, without any other prospect of _Advantage_ in the Beautiful Form, than the suggesting the pleasant Ideas of Beauty? Now this shews us, that however we may _pursue_ beautiful Objects from Self-love, with a view to obtain the Pleasures of Beauty, as in Architecture, Gardening, and many other Affairs; yet there must be a _Sense_ of Beauty, antecedent to Prospects even of this Advantage, without which Sense these Objects would not be thus _advantageous_, nor excite in us this Pleasure which constitutes them advantageous. Our _Sense_ of Beauty from Objects, by which they are constituted good to us, is very distinct from our _Desire_ of them when they are thus constituted: Our _Desire_ of Beauty may be counter-balanc'd by Rewards or Threatnings, but never our _Sense_ of it; even as Fear of Death may make us desire a bitter Potion, or neglect those Meats which the Sense of Taste would recommend as pleasant; but cannot make that Potion agreeable to the _Sense_, or Meat disagreeable to it, which was not so antecedently to this Prospect. The same holds true of the Sense of Beauty and Harmony; that the _Pursuit_ of such Objects is frequently neglected, from Prospects of Advantage, Aversion to Labour, or any other Motive of Interest, does not prove that we have no _Sense_ of Beauty, but only that our Desire of it may be counter-balanc'd by a stronger Desire.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Had^ we no such _Sense_ of Beauty and Harmony; Houses, Gardens, Dress, Equipage, might have been recommended to us as convenient, fruitful, warm, easy; but never as _beautiful_: And yet nothing is more certain, than that all these Objects are recommended under quite different _Views_ on many Occasions: 'Tis true, what chiefly pleases in the Countenance, are the Indications of _Moral Dispositions_; and yet were we by the longest Acquaintance fully convinc'd of the best Moral Dispositions in any Person, with that Countenance we now think deform'd, this would never hinder our immediate Dislike of the Form, or our liking other Forms more: And Custom, Education, or Example, could never give us _Perceptions_ distinct from those of the Senses which we had the Use of before, or recommend Objects under another _Conception_ than grateful to[n2] them.

The Ideas of Beauty and Harmony being excited upon our _Perception_ of some _primary Quality_, and having relation to _Figure_ and _Time_, may indeed have a nearer resemblance to Objects, than these Sensations, which seem not so much any _Pictures_ of Objects, as _Modifications_ of the perceiving Mind; and yet were there no Mind with a _Sense_ of Beauty to contemplate Objects, I see not how they could be call'd _Beautiful_.
