Let us consider what _Truths_ concerning Actions Men could desire to know, or prove by _Reason._ I fancy they may be reduced to these Heads. 1. \"To know whether there are not _some Actions_ or _Affections_ which obtain the _Approbation_ of any Spectator or Observer, and others move his _Dislike_ and _Condemnation?_ \" This Question, as every Man can answer for himself, so _universal Experience_ and _History_ shew, that in all Nations it is so; and consequently the _moral Sense is universal._ 2. \"Whether there be any particular _Quality,_ which, wherever it is apprehended, gains _Approbation,_ and the contrary raises _Disapprobation?_ \" We shall find this _Quality_ to be _kind Affection,_ or Study of the Good of others; and thus the _moral Senses_ of Men are generally _uniform._ About these two Questions there is little reasoning; we know how to answer them from reflecting on our own _Sentiments,_ or by consulting others. 3. \"What Actions do really _evidence kind Affections,_ or do really _tend to the greatest publick Good?_\" About this Question is all the special _Reasoning_ of those who treat of the particular _Laws of Nature,_ or even of _Civil Laws:_ This is the largest Field, and the most useful Subject of _Reasoning,_ which remains upon every _Scheme of Morals._ 4. \"What are the Motives which, even from Self‐Love, would excite each Individual to do those Actions which are publickly useful?\" 'Tis probable indeed, no Man would _approve_ as virtuous an Action _publickly useful,_ to which the Agent was excited only by _Self‐Love,_ without any _kind Affection:_ 'Tis also probable that no view of _Interest_ can raise that _kind Affection,_ which we _approve_ as virtuous; nor can any _Reasoning_ do it, except that which shews some _moral Goodness,_ or _kind Affections_ in the Object; for this never fails, where it is observed or supposed in any Person to raise the _Love_ of the Observer; so that _Virtue_ is not properly _taught._","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Yet since all Men have naturally _Self‐Love_ as well as _kind Affections,_ the former may often counteract the latter, or the latter the former; in each case the Agent is _uneasy,_ and in some degree _unhappy._ The first _rash Views_ of human Affairs often represent _private Interest_ as opposite to the _Publick:_ When this is apprehended, _Self‐Love_ may often engage Men in _publickly hurtful Actions,_ which their _moral Sense_ will condemn; and this is the ordinary Cause of Vice. To represent these Motives of _Self‐Interest,_ to engage Men to publickly useful Actions, is certainly the most necessary Point in Morals. This has been so well done by the _antient Moralists,_ by Dr. _Cumberland, Puffendorf, Grotius, Shaftesbury;_ 'tis made so certain from the _divine Government_ of the World, the _State of Mankind,_ who cannot subsist without Society, from universal _Experience_ and _Consent,_ from _inward Consciousness_ of the Pleasure of kind Affections, and _Self‐Approbation,_ and of the _Torments_ of _Malice,_ or _Hatred,_ or _Envy,_ or _Anger;_ that no Man who considers these things, can ever imagine he can have any possible _Interest_ in opposing the publick Good; or in checking or restraining his kind Affections; nay, if he had no _kind Affections,_ his very _Self‐Love_ and Regard to his private Good might excite him to publickly useful Actions, and dissuade from the contrary.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What farther should be provable concerning Virtue, whence it should be called _reasonable antecedently to all Affection,_ or _Interest,_ or _Sense,_ or what it should be _fit_ for, one cannot easily imagine.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Perhaps what has brought the Epithet _Reasonable,_ or _flowing from Reason,_ in opposition to what flows from _Instinct, Affection,_ or _Passion,_ so much into use, is this, \"That it is often observed, that the very best of our particular _Affections_ or _Desires,_ when they are grown violent and _passionate,_ thro' the _confused Sensations_ and _Propensities_ which attend them, do make us incapable of considering calmly the whole _Tendency_ of our Actions, and lead us often into what is _absolutely pernicious,_ under some Appearance of _relative_ or _particular Good._\" This indeed may give some ground for distinguishing between _passionate Actions,_ and _those_ from _calm Desire_ or _Affection_ which employs our _Reason_ freely: But can never set _rational Actions_ in Opposition to those from _Instinct, Desire_ or _Affection._ And it must be owned, that the most perfect Virtue consists in the _calm, unpassionate Benevolence,_ rather than in particular Affections.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#How we judge of our Moral Sense.#If one asks \"how do we know that _our Affections are right when they are kind?_\" What does the Word [right] mean? Does it mean _what we approve?_ This we know by _Consciousness_ of our _Sense._ Again, how do we know that our _Sense_ is right, or that we _approve our Approbation?_ This can only be answered by another Question, _viz._ \"How do we know we are pleased when we are pleased?\"—Or does it mean, \"how do we know that we shall _always_ approve what we _now_ approve?\" To answer this, we must first know that the _same Constitution_ of our _Sense_ shall always remain: And again, that we have applyed our selves carefully to consider the _natural Tendency_ of our Actions. Of the _Continuance_ of the same Constitution of our _Sense,_ we are as sure as of the Continuance of _Gravitation,_ or any other _Law of Nature:_ The _Tendency_ of our own Actions we cannot always know; but we may know certainly that we _heartily_ and _sincerely_ studied to act according to what, by all the Evidence now in our Power to obtain, appeared as most _probably tending to publick Good._ When we are conscious of this _sincere Endeavour,_ the _evil Consequences_ which we could not have foreseen, never will make us _condemn_ our Conduct. But without this _sincere Endeavour,_ we may often approve at _present_ what we shall _afterwards_ condemn.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#How our Moral Sense is corrected by Reason.#If the Question means, \"How are we sure that what _we_ approve, _all others_ shall also approve?\" Of this we can be sure upon _no Scheme;_ but 'tis highly probable that the _Senses_ of all Men are pretty _uniform:_ That the ^Deity^ also approves _kind Affections,_ otherwise he would not have implanted them in us, nor determined us by a _moral Sense_ to approve them. Now since the _Probability that Men shall judge truly,_ abstracting from any presupposed _Prejudice,_ is greater than that _they shall judge falsly;_ 'tis more probable, when our Actions are really _kind_and _publickly useful,_ that _all Observers_ shall judge _truly_ of our _Intentions,_ and of the _Tendency_ of our Actions, and consequently approve what _we_ approve our selves, than that they shall judge _falsly_ and condemn them.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the Meaning of the Question be, \"Will the doing what our _moral Sense_ approves tend to _our Happiness,_ and to the avoiding Misery?\" 'Tis thus we call a _Taste wrong,_ when it makes that _Food_at present _grateful,_ which shall occasion _future Pains,_ or _Death._ This Question concerning our _Self‐Interest_ must be answered by such _Reasoning_ as was mentioned above, to be well managed by our _Moralists_ both antient and modern.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus there seems no part of that _Reasoning_ which was ever used by _Moralists,_ to be superseded by supposing a _moral Sense._ And yet without a _moral Sense_ there is no Explication can be given of our _Ideas of Morality;_ nor of that _Reasonableness_ supposed _antecedent_ to all _Instincts, Affections,_ or _Sense._","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"But may there not be a _right_ or _wrong State_ of our _moral Sense,_ as there is in our other _Senses,_ according as they represent their Objects to be _as they really are,_ or represent them otherwise?\" So may not our _moral Sense_ approve that which is _vicious,_ and _disapprove Virtue,_ as a _sickly Palate_ may dislike _grateful Food,_ or a _vitiated Sight_ misrepresent _Colours_ or _Dimensions?_ Must we not know therefore _antecedently_ what is _morally Good_or _Evil_ by our _Reason,_ before we can know that our _moral Sense_ is _right?_","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To answer this, we must remember that of the _sensible Ideas,_ some are allowed to be only _Perceptions_ in our Minds, and not Images of any like _external Quality,_ as _Colours, Sounds, Tastes, Smells, Pleasure, Pain._ Other Ideas are _Images_ of something _external,_ as _Duration, Number, Extension, Motion, Rest:_ These _latter,_ for distinction, we may call _concomitant Ideas of Sensation,_ and the former _purely sensible._ As to the _purely sensible Ideas,_ we know they are _alter'd_by any Disorder in our _Organs,_ and made _different_ from what arise in us from the same Objects at other times. We do not denominate Objects from our _Perceptions during the Disorder,_ but according to our _ordinary Perceptions,_ or those of others in _good Health:_ Yet no body imagines that therefore _Colours, Sounds, Tastes,_ are not _sensible Ideas._ In like manner many _Circumstances_ diversify the _concomitant Ideas:_ But we denominate Objects from the Appearances they make to us in an _uniform Medium, when our Organs are in no disorder, and the Object not very distant from them._ But none therefore imagines that it is _Reason_ and not _Sense_ which discovers these _concomitant Ideas,_ or _primary Qualities._","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Just so in our _Ideas of Actions._ These three Things are to be distinguished, 1. The Idea of the _external Motion,_ known first by _Sense,_ and its _Tendency to the Happiness or Misery_ of some _sensitive Nature,_ often inferr'd by _Argument_ or _Reason._ 2. _Apprehension_ or _Opinion of the Affections_ in the Agent, concluded by our _Reason:_ So far the Idea of an _Action_ represents something _external_ to the Observer. 3. The _Perception of Approbation or Disapprobation_ arising in the Observer, according as the _Affections of the Agent_ are apprehended _kind_in their _just Degree,_ or _deficient,_ or _malicious._ This _Approbation_ cannot be supposed an _Image of any thing external,_ more than the _Pleasure of Harmony, of Taste, of Smell._ But let none imagine, that calling the _Ideas of Virtue_ and _Vice_ Perceptions of a _Sense,_ upon apprehending the _Actions_ and _Affections_ of another does diminish their _Reality,_ more than the like _Assertions_ concerning all _Pleasure_ and _Pain, Happiness_ or _Misery._ Our _Reason_ does often correct the _Report of our Senses,_ about the _natural Tendency_ of the external Action, and corrects _rash Conclusions_ about the _Affections_ of the Agent. But whether our _moral Sense_ be subject to such a Disorder, as to have _different Perceptions,_ from the same apprehended _Affections_ in an Agent, at _different times,_ as the _Eye_ may have of the Colours of an unaltered Object, 'tis not easy to determine: Perhaps it will be hard to find any Instances of such a _Change._ What _Reason_ could correct, if it fell into such a _Disorder,_ I know not; except suggesting to its _Remembrance_ its _former Approbations,_ and representing the _general Sense_ of Mankind. But this does not prove Ideas of _Virtue_ and _Vice_ to be previous to a _Sense,_ more than a like _Correction_ of the Ideas of _Colour_ in a Person under the _Jaundice,_ proves that _Colours_ are perceived by _Reason,_ previously to _Sense._","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If any say, \"this _moral Sense_ is not a _Rule:_\" What means that Word? It is not a _strait rigid Body:_ It is not a _general Proposition, shewing what Means are fit to obtain an end:_ It is not a _Proposition, asserting, that a Superior will make those happy who act one way, and miserable who act the contrary way._ If these be the Meanings of _Rule,_ it is no _Rule;_ yet by reflecting upon it our Understanding may find out a _Rule._ But what _Rule_ of Actions can be formed, without Relation to some _End_proposed? Or what _End_can be proposed, without presupposing _Instincts, Desires, Affections,_ or a _moral Sense,_ it will not be easy to explain.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.4.12"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hutcheson","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":1725,"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hutcheson.IBV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1725],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Inquiry into Beauty and Virtue"},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1728],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay and Illustrations"},{"id":"Hutcheson.LFV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"Letters Between the Late Mr. Gilbert Burnet and Mr. Hutchinson, Concerning the True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1735],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Burnet.LFV","breadcrumb":"Letters on the Foundation of Virtue"},{"id":"Hutcheson.RL","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"Reflections upon Laughter and Remarks on the Fable of Bees","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1750],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Reflections upon Laughter"}]},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1728],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay and Illustrations"},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS","imported":true,"title":"Illustrations upon the Moral Sense","breadcrumb":"Illustrations upon the Moral Sense","published":[1728]}],"prev":{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3","imported":true,"title":"Section 3.
