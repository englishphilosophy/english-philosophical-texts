And a _casual Invention_ may be _meritorious._—Perhaps _Free Election_ is a _Conditio sine qua non,_ and _publick Usefulness_ the immediate _Cause_ of Approbation; neither separately, but both jointly are _meritorious: Free Election alone_ is not _Merit; Publick Usefulness alone_ is not _Merit;_ but both concurring. Then should any Person by _mere Election,_ without any _Desire_ to serve the publick, set about _Mines,_ or any _useful Manufacture;_ or should a Person by _mere Election_ stab a Man, without knowing him to be a _publick Robber;_ here both _free Election_ and _publick Usefulness_ may concur: Yet will any one say there is _Merit_ or _Virtue_ in such Actions? Where then shall we find Merit, unless in _kind Affections,_ or _Desire_ and _Intention_ of the publick Good? This moves our _Approbation_ wherever we observe it: and the want of this is the true _Reason_ why a _Searcher for Mines,_ a _free Killer_ of an unknown Robber, the _warming Sun,_ or the _fruitful Tree,_ are not counted _meritorious._","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But it may be said, that to make an Action _meritorious,_ it is necessary not only that the Action be _publickly useful,_ but that it be _known_ or _imagined_to be _such,_ before the Agent freely chuses it.

Only a _Judgment_ or _Opinion_ in the _Understanding,_ concerning the _natural Tendency_ of an Action to the publick Good: Few, it may be presumed, will place _Virtue_ in _Assent_ or _Dissent,_ or _Perceptions._ And yet this is all that is superadded to the former Case. The Agent must not _desire_ the publick Good, or have any _kind Affections._ This would spoil the _Freedom of Choice,_ according to their Scheme, who insist on a _Freedom opposite to Affections_ _or Instincts:_ But he must _barely know_ the Tendency to publick Good, and without any _Propensity_ to, or _Desire_ of, the Happiness of others, by an _arbitrary Election,_ acquire his Merit.

Evil Inclinations in an Agent would certainly rather have some Tendency to _diminish_ the Love of the superior Mind.
