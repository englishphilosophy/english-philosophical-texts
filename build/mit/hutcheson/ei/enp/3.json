These two are the proper _Affections_, distinct from all _Sensation_: We may call both _Desires_ if we please. #Joy and Sorrow.# The Reflection upon the Presence or certain Futurity of any Good, raises the Sensation of Joy, which is distinct from those immediate Sensations which arise from the Object itself.[n2] A like Sensation is raised, when we reflect upon the Removal or Prevention of Evil which once threatned ourselves or others. The _Reflection_ upon the Presence of Evil, or the certain Prospect of it, or of the Loss of Good, is the Occasion of the Sensation of _Sorrow_, distinct from those _immediate Sensations_ arising from the Objects or Events themselves.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Affections may be distinguished from Passions.# ^These^ Affections, _viz._ _Desire_, _Aversion_, _Joy_ and _Sorrow_, we may, after =^Malebranche^=, call _spiritual_ or _pure Affections_; because the purest Spirit, were it subject to any Evil, might be capable of them. But beside these Affections, which seem to arise necessarily from a rational Apprehension of Good or Evil, there are in our Nature violent _confused Sensations_, connected with _bodily Motions_, from which our _Affections_ are denominated _Passions_.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Affections attended with undesigning Propensities.# ^We^ may further observe something in our Nature, determining us very frequently to Action, distinct both from _Sensation_ and _Desire_; if by Desire we mean a distinct Inclination to something apprehended as Good either publick or private, or as the Means of avoiding Evil: _viz._ a certain _Propensity of Instinct_ to Objects and Actions, without any Conception of them as Good, or as the Means of preventing Evil. These Objects or Actions are generally, tho' not always, in effect the _Means_ of some Good; but we are determined to them even without this Conception of them. Thus, as we observed above,[n3] the _Propensity to Fame_ may continue after one has lost all notion of _Good_, either publick or private, which could be the Object of a distinct Desire. Our _particular Affections_ have generally some of these _Propensities_ accompanying them; but these Propensities are sometimes without the Affections or distinct Desires, and have a stronger Influence upon the Generality of Men, than the Affections could have alone. Thus in Anger, beside the Intention of removing the uneasy Sensation from the Injury received; beside the Desire of obtaining a Reparation of it, and Security for the future, which are some sort of _Goods_ intended by Men when they are calm, as well as during the Passion, there is in the passionate Person a Propensity to occasion _Misery_ to the Offender, a Determination to _Violence_, even where there is no _Intention_ of any Good to be obtained, or Evil avoided by this Violence. #Anger.# And it is principally this Propensity which we denote by the Name _Anger_, tho' other Desires may often accompany it.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^So^ also our _Presence_ with the distressed is generally necessary to their relief; and yet when we have no Hopes nor Intention of relieving them, we shall find a _Propensity_ to run to such Spectacles of Pity. Thus also, beside the calm _Desire_ of the Happiness of a Person beloved, we have a strong Propensity to their _Company_, to the very _Sight_ of them, without any Consideration of it as a Happiness either to ourselves or to the Person beloved. The sudden Appearance of great Danger, determines us to shriek out or fly, before we can have any distinct Desires, or any Consideration that a Shriek or Flight are proper means of Relief. These _Propensities_, along with the Sensations above-mentioned, when they occur without rational Desire, we may call _Passions_, and when they happen along with Desires, denominate them _passionate_. This part of our Constitution is as intelligible as many others universally observed and acknowledged; such as these, that Danger of falling makes us stretch out our Arms; noise makes us wink; that a Child is determined to suck; many other Animals to rise up and walk; some to run into Water, before they can have any Notion of Good to be obtained, or Evil avoided by these means.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Love and Hatred.# ^It^ may perhaps be convenient to confine _Love_ and _Hatred_ to our Sentiments toward Moral Agents; _Love_ denoting \"_Desire_ of the Happiness of another, generally attended with some _Approbation_ of him as innocent at least, or being of a mixed Character, where Good is generally prevalent:\" And _Hatred_\"denoting Disapprobation by our _Sense_, with the Absence of Desire of their Happiness.\" _Benevolence_ may denote only \"the Desire of another's Happiness;\" and _Malice_, \"the Desire of their Misery,\" abstractly from any Approbation or Condemnation by our _Moral Sense_. This sort of Malice is never found in our Nature, when we are not transported with Passion. #Envy.# The Propensities of Anger and Envy have some Resemblance of it; yet Envy is not an ultimate Desire of another's Misery, but only a subordinate Desire of it, as the Means of advancing ourselves, or some Person more beloved than the Person envied.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Fear.# ^Fear^, as far as it is an _Affection_, and not an undesigning Propensity, is \"a Mixture of _Sorrow_ and _Aversion_, when we apprehend the Probability of Evil, or the Loss of Good befalling ourselves, or those we love:\" There is more or less of Sorrow, according to the apprehended Degrees of Probability. #Hope.# Hope, if it be any way an Affection, and not an Opinion, is \"a Mixture of _Desire_ and _Joy_, upon the probability of obtaining Good, and avoiding Evil.\" Both these Passions may have some _Propensities_ and _Sensations_ attending them, distinct from those of the other Affections.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Confused Use of Names.# ^The^ confused Use of the Names, _Love_, _Hatred_, _Joy_, _Sorrow_, _Delight_, has made some of the most important Distinctions of our Affections and Passions, to be overlooked.

The _Love of Money_, for Instance, the _Love of a generous Character_, or a _Friend_: The _Love of a fine Seat_, and _the Love of a Child_.

Where we get some special distinct _Names_, we more easily acknowledge a Difference, as it may appear in _Shame_ and _Anger_; but had we other _Names_, appropriated in the same manner, we should imagine, with good ground, as many distinct _Passions_.

Pains have many differences among themselves, and so have Pleasures, according to the different _Senses_ by which they are perceived. To enumerate all these _Diversities_, would be difficult and tedious. But some Men have piqued themselves so much upon representing \"all our Affections as _selfish_; as if each Person were in his whole Frame only a _seperate System_ from his Fellows, so that there was nothing in his Constitution leading him to a _publick Interest_, further than he apprehended it subservient to his own private Interest; and this Interest made nothing else, than the gratifying our _external Senses_ and _Imagination_, or obtaining the Means of it:\" that thereby the Wisdom and Goodness of the ^Author^ of our Nature is traduced, as if he had given us the strongest _Dispositions_ toward what he had in his Laws prohibited; and directed us, by the Frame of our Nature, to the meanest and most contemptible Pursuits; as if _what_ all good Men have represented as the _Excellence_ of our Nature, were a _Force_ or _Constraint_ put upon it by _Art_ or _Authority_. It may be useful to consider our Affections and Passions more particularly, as \"they are excited by something in our Frame different from _Self‐Love_, and tend to something else than the private Pleasures of the _external Senses or Imagination_.\" This we may do under the following Heads, by shewing, 1. How our Passions arise from the _Moral Sense_, and _Sense of Honour_. 2. How our Passions tend toward the _State of others_, abstractly from any Consideration of their _Moral Qualities_. 3. How the _publick Passions_ are diversified by the _Moral Qualities_ of the Agents, when they appear to our Moral Sense as virtuous or vicious. 4. How the publick Passions are diversified by the _Relations_ of several Agents to each other, when we consider at once their _State_ as to Happiness or Misery, and their past as well as present _Actions_ towards each other. 5.

The _Ruin of a Free State_, the _Slavery of a generous Spirit_, a _Life upon shameful Terms_, still appear vastly greater Evils; beside many other exquisite _Distresses_ of a more private nature, in comparison of which, an honourable Death befalling a favourite Character, is looked upon as a Deliverance.","subId":"25","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Passions toward moral evil Agents.# ^Under^ this Class are also included the Passions employed about the Fortunes of Characters, apprehended as _morally Evil_.

Anger.# But _Malice_, or the _ultimate Desire_ of their Misery, does not necessarily arise toward them. Perhaps our Nature is not capable of desiring the Misery of any Being calmly, farther than it may be necessary to the Safety of the innocent: We may find, perhaps, that there is no Quality in any Object which would excite in us _pure disinterested Malice_, or calm Desire of Misery for its own sake.[n5] When we apprehend any Person as _injurious_ to ourselves, or to any innocent Person, especially to a Person beloved, the Passion of _Anger_ arises toward the Agent. By _Anger_ is generally meant \"a Propensity to occasion Evil to another, arising upon apprehension of an Injury done by him:\" This violent Propensity is attended generally, when the Injury is not very sudden, with _Sorrow_ for the Injury sustained, or threatned, and _Desire_ of repelling it, and making the Author of it _repent_ of his Attempt, or _repair_ the Damage.","subId":"26","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Its Effects.#This Passion is attended with the most violent _uneasy Sensations_, and produces as great Changes in our Bodies as any whatsoever.

Upon these Evidences of Reformation in the Invader, our Passion naturally abates; or if in any perverse Temper it does not, the _Sense of Mankind_ turns against him, and he is looked upon as cruel and inhumane.","subId":"28","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.3.28"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^In^ considering more fully the Passions about the Fortunes of evil Characters, distinct from _Anger_, which arises upon a fresh Injury, we may first consider the evil Agents, such as a sudden View sometimes represents them, _directly evil_ and _malicious_; and then make proper Abatements, for _what_ the worst of Men come short of this compleatly evil Temper.

The _Prospect of Evil_, befalling an evil Character, at first, perhaps, seems grateful to the Observer, if he has conceived the Passion of _Anger_; but to a sedate Temper, no Misery is farther the Occasion of _Joy_, than as it is necessary to some prepollent Happiness in the whole. The _escaping_ of Evil impending over such a Character, by which he is confirmed in Vice, is the Occasion of _Sorrow_, and _Distrust_ of Providence and Virtue; and the Evil befalling him raises _Joy_, and _Satisfaction_ with Providence, and _Security_ in Virtue.
