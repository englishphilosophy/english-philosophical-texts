We are so constituted by Nature, that, as soon as we form the Idea of certain Objects or Events, our _Desire_ or _Aversion_ will arise toward them; and consequently our Affections must very much depend upon the _Opinions_ we form, concerning any thing which occurs to our Mind, its _Qualities_, _Tendencies_, or _Effects_. Thus the Happiness of every sensitive Nature is desired, as soon as we remove all _Opinion_ or _Apprehension_ of _Opposition of Interest_ between this Being and others. The _Apprehension_ of morally good Qualities, is the necessary Cause of _Approbation_, by our moral Sense, and of stronger _Love_. The Cause of _Hatred_, is the _Apprehension_ of the opposite Qualities. _Fear_, in like manner, must arise from _Opinion of Power_, and _Inclination_ to hurt us: _Pity_ from the Opinion of another's _undeserved Misery_: _Shame_ only arises from _Apprehension_ of _Contempt_ from others: _Joy_, in any Event, must arise from an Opinion of its Goodness. Our _selfish Passions_ in this, do not differ from our _publick ones_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^This^ may shew us some Inconsistency in Topicks of Argument, often used to inculcate _Piety_ and _Virtue_. Whatever Motives of Interest we suggest, either from a present or future _Reward_, must be ineffectual, until we have first laboured to form _amiable Conceptions_ of the _Deity_, and of our _Fellow-Creatures_. And yet in many Writers, even in this Cause, \"Mankind are represented as _absolutely evil_, or at best as _entirely selfish_; nor are there any nobler Ideas of the ^Deity^ suggested. It is grown a _fashionable Topick_, to put some _sly selfish Construction_ upon the most generous human Actions; and he passes for the _shreudest Writer_, or _Orator_, who is most artful in these Insinuations.\"","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Appetites and Affections distinguished.# ^The^ Government of our Passions must then depend much upon our _Opinions_: But we must here observe an obvious Difference among our Desires, _viz._ that \"some of them have a _previous_, painful, or uneasy Sensation, antecedently to any _Opinion_ of Good in the Object; nay, the Object is often chiefly esteemed good, only for its _allaying this Pain_ or Uneasiness; or if the Object gives also positive Pleasure, yet the _uneasy Sensation_ is previous to, and independent of this _Opinion_ of Good in the Object.\" These Desires we may call _Appetites_. \"Other Desires and Aversions necessarily pre-suppose an _Opinion_ of Good and Evil in their Objects; and the Desires or Aversions, with their concomitant uneasy Sensations, are produced or occasioned by this _Opinion_ or _Apprehension_.\" Of the former kind are _Hunger_ and _Thirst_, and the Desires between the _Sexes_; to which Desires there is an uneasy Sensation _previous_, even in those who have little other Notion of Good in the Objects, than allaying this _Pain_ or _Uneasiness._ There is something like to this in the Desire of _Society_, or the Company of our Fellow-creatures. Our Nature is so much formed for this, that altho' the _Absence of Company_ is not immediately painful, yet if it be long, and the Person be not employed in something which tends to _Society_ at last, or which is designed to fit him for Society, an uneasy _Fretfulness_, _Sullenness_, and _Discontent_, will grow upon him by degrees, which Company alone can remove. He shall not perhaps be sensible always, that it is the Absence of Company which occasions his Uneasiness: A painful Sensation dictates nothing of itself; it must be therefore some _Reflection_ or _Instinct_, distinct from the Pain, which suggests the Remedy. Our Benevolence and Compassion pre-suppose indeed some _Knowledge_ of other sensitive Beings, and of what is good or evil to them: But they do not arise from any previous _Opinion_, that \"the Good of others tends to the Good of the Agent.\" They are _Determinations of our Nature_, previous to our Choice from Interest, which excite us to Action, as soon as we know other sensitive or rational Beings, and have any Apprehension of their Happiness or Misery.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^In^ other Desires the Case is different. No Man is distressed for want of _fine Smells_, _harmonious Sounds_, _beautiful Objects_, _Wealth_, _Power_, or _Grandeur_, previously to some Opinion formed of these things as good, or some _prior Sensation_ of their Pleasures. In like manner, _Virtue_ and _Honour_ as necessarily give us Pleasure, when they occur to us, as Vice and Contempt give us Pain; but, antecedently to some _Experience_ or _Opinion_ of this Pleasure, there is no previous uneasy Sensation in their Absence, as there is in the Absence of the Objects of _Appetite_.

In like manner, the _escaping_ any Object of Aversion, tho' it makes no permanent Addition to our Happiness, gives at first a pleasant _Sensation_, and relieves us from Misery, proportioned to the Degree of _Aversion_ or _Fear_.

Before _their_ Intervention, the bodily Appetites are easily satisfied: Nature has put it in almost every one's power, so far to gratify them, as to support the Body, and remove Pain.

All we can do in this affair, is to enjoy a great Share of the Pleasures of the _stronger Ties_, with fewer _Pains_ of them, by confining the stronger Degrees of Love, or our Friendships, to Persons of _corrected Imaginations_, to whom as few of the uncertain Objects of Desire are necessary to Happiness as is possible.

But then Virtue consists in Benevolence, or Desire of the publick Good: _The Happiness of others_ is very uncertain, so that our publick Desires may often be disappointed; and every Disappointment is uneasy, in proportion to the Degree of Desire. And therefore, however the _Admiration_ and fixed _Pursuit of Virtue_ may always secure one stable and constant Pleasure of _Self‐Approbation_, yet this Enjoyment presupposes a _Desire of publick Good_, subject to frequent Disappointments, which will be attended with Uneasiness proportioned to the Degree of publick Desire, or the _Virtue_ upon which we reflect. There seems therefore no possibility of securing to ourselves, in our present State, an _unmixed Happiness_ independently of all other Beings.
