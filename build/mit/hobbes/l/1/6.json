That Sense, is Motion in the organs and interiour parts of mans body, caused by the action of the things we See, Heare, &_c_; And that Fancy is but the Reliques of the same Motion, remaining after Sense, has been already sayd in the first and second Chapters. And because _going, speaking_, and the like Voluntary motions, depend alwayes upon a precedent thought of _whither, which way_, and _what_; it is evident, that the Imagination is the first internall beginning of all Voluntary Motion. And although unstudied men, doe not conceive any motion at all to be there, where the thing moved is invisible; or the space it is moved in, is (for the shortnesse of it) insensible; yet that doth not hinder, but that such Motions are. For let a space#_Endeavour_# be never so little, that which is moved over a greater space, whereof that little one is part, must first be moved over that. These small beginnings of Motion, within the body of Man, before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and other visible actions, are commonly called Endeavour.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.1.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Appetite.

These words _Appetite_, and we have from the _Latines_; and they both of them signifie the motions, one of approaching, the other of retiring. So also do the Greek words for the same, which are $ὁρμὴ$ and $ὀϕορμὴ$. For Nature it selfe does often presse upon men those truths, which afterwards, when they look for somewhat beyond Nature, they stumble at.
