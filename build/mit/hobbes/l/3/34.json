For the _Universe_, being the Aggregate of all Bodies, there is no reall part thereof that is not also _Body_; nor any thing properly a Body, that is not also part of (that Aggregate of all _Bodies_) the _Universe_. The same also, because Bodies are subject to change, that is to say, to variety of apparence to the sense of living creatures, is called _Substance_, that is to say, _Subject_, to various accidents; as sometimes to be Moved, some-times to stand Still; and to seem to our senses sometimes Hot, sometimes Cold, sometimes of one Colour, Smel, Tast, or Sound, sometimes of another. And this diversity of Seeming, (produced by the diversity of the operation of bodies, on the organs of our sense) we attribute to alterations of the Bodies that operate, & call them _Accidents_ of those Bodies. And according to this acceptation of the word, _Substance_ and _Body_, signifie the same thing; and therefore _Substance incorporeall_ are words, which when they are joined together, destroy one another, as if a man should say, an _Incorporeall Body_.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But in the sense of common people, not all the Universe is called Body, but only such parts thereof as they can discern by the sense of Feeling, to resist their force, or by the sense of their Eyes, to hinder them from a farther prospect. Therefore in the common language of men, _Aire_, and _aeriall substances_, use not to be taken for _Bodies_, but (as often as men are sensible of their effects) are called _Wind_, or _Breath_, or (because the same are called in the Latine _Spiritus_) _Spirits_; as when they call that aeriall substance, which in the body of any living creature, gives it life and motion, _Vitall_ and _Animall spirits_. But for those Idols of the brain, which represent Bodies to us, where they are not, as in a Looking-glasse, in a Dream, or to a Distempered brain waking, they are (as the Apostle saith generally of all Idols) nothing; Nothing at all, I say, there where they seem to bee; and in the brain it self, nothing but tumult, proceeding either from the action of the objects, or from the disorderly agitation of the Organs of our Sense. And men, that are otherwise imployed, then to search into their causes, know not of themselves, what to call them; and may therefore easily be perswaded, by those whose knowledge they much reverence, some to call them _Bodies_, and think them made of aire compacted by a power supernaturall, because the sight judges them corporeall; and some to call them _Spirits_, because the sense of Touch discerneth nothing in the place where they appear, to resist their fingers: So that the proper signification of _Spirit_ in common speech, is either a subtile, fluid, and invisible Body, or a Ghost, or other Idol or Phantasme of the Imagination. But for metaphoricall significations, there be many: for sometimes it is taken for Disposition or Inclination of the mind; as when for the disposition to controwl the sayings of other men, we say, _a spirit of contradiction_; For _a disposition to uncleannesse, an unclean spirit_; for _perversenesse, a froward spirit_; for _sullennesse, a dumb spirit_, and for _inclination to godlinesse, and Gods service, the Spirit of God_: sometimes for any eminent ability, or extraordinary passion, or disease of the mind, as when _great wisdome_ is called the _spirit of wisdome_; and _mad men_ are said to be _possessed with a spirit_.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Other signification of _Spirit_ I find no where any; and where none of these can satisfie the sense of that word in Scripture, the place falleth not under humane Understanding; and our Faith therein consisteth not in our Opinion, but in our Submission; as in all places where God is said to be a _Spirit_; or where by the _Spirit of God_, is meant God himselfe. For the nature of God is incomprehensible; that is to say, we understand nothing of _what he is_, but only _that he is_; and therefore the Attributes we give him, are not to tell one another, _what he is_, nor to signifie our opinion of his Nature, but our desire to honour him with such names as we conceive most honorable amongst our selves.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The Spirit of God taken in the Scripture sometimes for a Wind, or Breath._# _Gen_. 1. 2. _The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters_.

Neither was this apparition a Fancy figured, but a Voice. By which it is manifest, that _Angel_ signifieth there, nothing but _God_ himself, that caused Agar supernaturally to apprehend a voice from heaven; or rather, nothing else but a Voice supernaturall, testifying Gods speciall presence there. Why therefore may not the Angels that appeared to Lot, and are called _Gen_. 19. 13. _Men_; and to whom, though they were two, Lot speaketh (ver. 18.) as but to one, and that one, as God, (for the words are, _Lot said unto them, Oh not so my Lord_) be understood of images of men, supernaturally formed in the Fancy; as well as before by Angel was understood a fancyed Voice?

The Angels which Jacob saw on the Ladder of Heaven (_Gen_. 28. 12.) were a Vision of his sleep; therefore onely Fancy, and a Dream; yet being supernaturall, and signs of Gods speciall presence, those apparitions are not improperly called _Angels_.

Therefore to comprehend them all at once, I say, there is no text in that part of the Old Testament, which the Church of England holdeth for Canonicall, from which we can conclude, there is, or hath been created, any permanent thing (understood by the name of _Spirit_ or _Angel_,) that hath not quantity; and that may not be, by the understanding divided; that is to say, considered by parts; so as one part may bee in one place, and the next part in the next place to it; and, in summe, which is not (taking Body for that, which is some what, or some where) Corporeall; but in every place, the sense will bear the interpretation of Angel, for Messenger; as John Baptist is called an Angel, and Christ the Angel of the Covenant; and as (according to the same Analogy) the Dove, and the Fiery Tongues, in that they were signes of Gods speciall presence, might also be called Angels. Though we find in Daniel two names of Angels, _Gabriel_, and _Michael_; yet it is cleer out of the text it selfe, (_Dan_. 12. 1.) that by _Michael_ is meant _Christ_, not as an Angel, but as a Prince: and that _Gabriel_ (as the like apparitions made to other holy men in their sleep) was nothing but a supernaturall phantasme, by which it seemed to _Daniel_, in his dream, that two Saints being in talke, one of them said to the other, _Gabriel, let us make this man understand his Vision_: For God needeth not, to distinguish his Celestiall servants by names, which are usefull onely to the short memories of Mortalls. Nor in the New Testament is there any place, out of which it can be proved, that Angels (except when they are put for such men, as God hath made the Messengers, and Ministers of his word, or works) are things permanent, and withall incorporeall. That they are permanent, may bee gathered from the words of our Saviour himselfe, (_Mat_. 25. 41.) where he saith, it shall be said to the wicked in the last day, _Go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels_: which place is manifest for the permanence of Evill Angels, (unlesse wee might think the name of Devill and his Angels may be understood of the Churches Adversaries and their Ministers;) but then it is repugnant to their Immateriality; because Everlasting fire is no punishment to impatible substances, such as are all things Incorporeall. Angels therefore are not thence proved to be Incorporeall. In like manner where St. Paul sayes (1 _Cor_. 6. 3.) _Know ye not that wee shall judge the Angels?_ And (2 _Pet_. 2. 4.) _For if God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down into hell_. And (_Jude_ 1, 6.) _And the Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation, hee hath reserved in everlasting chaines under darknesse unto the Judgment of the last day; though it prove the Permanence of Angelicall nature, it confirmeth also their Materiality._ And (_Mat_. 22. 30.) _In the resurrection men doe neither marry, nor give in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven_: but in the resurrection men shall be Permanent, and not Incorporeall; so therefore also are the Angels.","subId":"23","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There be divers other places out of which may be drawn the like conclusion. To men that understand the signification of these words, _Substance_, and _Incorporeall_; as _Incorporeall_ is taken not for subtile body but for _not Body_, they imply a contradiction: insomuch as to say, an Angel, or Spirit is (in that sense) an Incorporeall Substance, is to say in effect, there is no Angel nor Spirit at all. Considering therefore the signification of the word Angel in the Old Testament, and the nature of Dreams and Visions that happen to men by the ordinary way of Nature; I was enclined to this opinion, that Angels were nothing but supernaturall apparitions of the Fancy, raised by the speciall and extraordinary operation of God, thereby to make his presence and commandements known to mankind, and chiefly to his own people. But the many places of the New Testament, and our Saviours own words, and in such texts, wherein is no suspicion of corruption of the Scripture, have extorted from my feeble Reason, an acknowledgment, and beleef, that there be also Angels substantiall, and permanent. But to beleeve they be in no place, that is to say, no where, that is to say, nothing, as they (though indirectly) say, that will have them Incorporeall, cannot by Scripture bee evinced.","subId":"24","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Inspiration what._# In the signification of the word _Spirit_, dependeth that of the word ^Inspiration^; which must either be taken properly; and then it is nothing but the blowing into a man some thin and subtile aire, or wind, in such manner as a man filleth a bladder with his breath; or if Spirits be not corporeall, but have their existence only in the fancy, it is nothing but the blowing in of a Phantasme; which is improper to say, and impossible; for Phantasmes are not, but only seem to be somewhat. That word therefore is used in the Scripture metaphorically onely: As (_Gen_. 2. 7.) where it is said, that God _inspired_ into man the breath of life, no more is meant, then that God gave unto him vitall motion. For we are not to think that God made first a living breath, and then blew it into Adam after he was made, whether that breath were reall, or seeming; but only as it is (_Acts_ 17. 25.) _that he gave him life, and breath_; that is, made him a living creature. And where it is said (2 _Tim_. 3. 16.) _all Scripture is given by Inspiration from God_, speaking there of the Scripture of the Old Testament, it is an easie metaphor, to signifie, that God enclined the spirit or mind of those Writers, to write that which should be usefull, in teaching, reproving, correcting, and instructing men in the way of righteous living. But where St. Peter (2 _Pet_. 1. 21.) saith, that _Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit_, by the Holy Spirit, is meant the voice of God in a Dream, or Vision supernaturall, which is not _Inspiration_: Nor when our Saviour breathing on his Disciples, said, _Receive the Holy Spirit_, was that Breath the Spirit, but a sign of the spirituall graces he gave unto them. And though it be said of many, and of our Saviour himself, that he was full of the Holy _Spirit_; yet that Fulnesse is not to be understood for _Infusion_ of the substance of God, but for accumulation of his gifts, such as are the gift of sanctity of life, of tongues, and the like, whether attained supernaturally, or by study and industry; for in all cases they are the gifts of God. So likewise where God sayes (_Joel_ 2. 28.) _I will powre out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophecy, your Old men shall dream Dreams, and your Young men shall see Visions_, wee are not to understand it in the proper sense, as if his _Spirit_ were like water, subject to effusion, or infusion; but as if God had promised to give them Propheticall Dreams, and Visions. For the proper use of the word _infused_, in speaking of the graces of God, is an abuse of it; for those graces are Vertues, not Bodies to be carryed hither and thither, and to be powred into men, as into barrels.","subId":"25","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the same manner, to take _Inspiration_ in the proper sense, or to say that Good _Spirits_ entred into men to make them prophecy, or Evill _Spirits_ into those that became Phrenetique, Lunatique, or Epileptique, is not to take the word in the sense of the Scripture; for the Spirit there is taken for the power of God, working by causes to us unknown. As also (_Acts_ 2. 2.) the wind, that is there said to fill the house wherein the Apostles were assembled on the day of Pentecost, is not to be understood for the Holy _Spirit_, which is the Deity it self; but for an Externall sign of Gods speciall working on their hearts, to effect in them the internall graces, and holy vertues hee thought requisite for the performance of their Apostleship.","subId":"26","id":"Hobbes.L.3.34.26"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore Politico"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Cive"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Libertie and Necessitie"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Behemoth"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Answer to Bramhall"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.L.3","imported":true,"title":"The Third Part, Of A Christian Common-wealth","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1651]}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.33","imported":true,"title":"Of the Number, Antiquity, Scope, Authority, and Interpreters of the Books of Holy Scripture","breadcrumb":"Chapter 33","published":[1651]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.35","imported":true,"title":"Of the Signification in Scripture of Kingdome Of God, of Holy, Sacred, and Sacrament","breadcrumb":"Chapter 35","published":[1651]}}
