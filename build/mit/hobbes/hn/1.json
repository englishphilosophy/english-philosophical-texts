concerning which Points, as the _Writings_ of Men from Antiquity down wards have still increased, so also have the _Doubts_ and _Controversies_ concerning the same: And seeing that true Knowledge begetteth not Doubt nor Controversie, but Knowledge, it is manifest from the present Controversies, That they which have _heretofore_ written thereof, have not well understood their own Subject.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Harm_ I can do none, though I err no less than they; for I shall leave Men but as they are, in Doubt and Dispute: but, intending not to take any Principle upon _Trust,_ but only to put Men in Mind of what they _know already,_ or _may know_ by their own Experience, I hope to erre the less; and when I do, it must proceed from too _hasty Concluding,_ which I will endeavour as much as I can to avoid.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the other side, if _Reasoning aright_ win not _Consent,_ which may very easily happen, from them that being confident of their own Knowledg weigh not what is said, the _Fault_ is not mine but theirs;

and all those Things which he had before seen or perceived in it; every one by his own Experience knowing, that the _Absence_ or _Destruction_ of things once imagined doth not cause the _Absence_ or _Destruction_ of the _Imagination_ it self; This _Imagery_ and _Representations_ of the Qualities of the Thing without, is that we call our _Conception, Imagination, Ideas, Notice_ or _Knowledg_ of them; and the _Faculty_ or Power by which we are capable of such Knowledge, is that I here call _Cognitive Power,_ or _Conceptive,_ the Power of Knowing or Conceiving.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.1.8"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature;
