Who, by answering, It was Green, discovered himself, and was punished for a Counterfeit: for though by his Sight newly received he might distinguish between Green, and Red, and all other Colours, as well as any that should interrogate him, yet he could not possibly know at first Sight which of them was called Green, or Red, or by any other Name. By this we may understand, there be _two Kinds_ of Knowledge, whereof the _one_ is nothing else but _Sense,_ or Knowledge _original,_ as I have said in the Beginning of the second Chapter, and _Remembrance_ of the same; the _other_ is called _Science_ or Knowledge of the _Truth of Propositions,_ and how Things are called; and is derived from _Understanding._ Both of these Sorts are but _Experience_; The former being the Experience of the Effects of Things that work upon us from _without_; and the latter Experience Men have from the proper Use of _Names_ in Language: and all Experience being, as I have said, but Remembrance, all Knowledge is Remembrance: and of the _former,_ the Register we keep in Books, is called _History_; But the Registers of the _latter_ are called the _Sciences._","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are _two Things_ necessarily implied in this Word _Knowledge_; the one is _Truth,_ the other _Evidence_: for what is not Truth, can never be known. For, let a Man say he knoweth a Thing never so well, if the same shall afterwards appear false, he is driven to Confession, that it was not Knowledge, but Opinion. Likewise, if the Truth be not evident, though a Man holdeth it, yet is his Knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold the contrary: for if Truth were enough to make it Knowledge, all Truth were known; which is not so.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What _Truth_ is, hath been defined in the _precedent_ Chapter; What _Evidence_ is, I _now_ set down: and it is the Concomitance of a Mans _Conception_ with the _Words_ that signifie such Conception in the Act of Ratiocination: for when a Man reasoneth with his Lips only, to which the Mind suggesteth only the Beginning, and followeth not the Words of his Mouth with the Conceptions of his Mind, out of Custom of so speaking; though he begin his Ratiocination with True Propositions, and proceed with certain Syllogisms, and thereby make always true Conclusions; yet are not his Conclusions _evident_ to him, for Want of the _Concomitance_ of _Conception_ with his Words: for if the Words alone were sufficient, a _Parrot_ might be taught as well to know Truth, as to speak it. Evidence is to Truth, as the Sap to the Tree, which, so far as it creepeth along with Body and Branches, keepeth them alive; where it forsaketh them, they die: for this Evidence, which is Meaning with our Words, is the Life of Truth.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Knowledge therefore which we call _Science,_ I define to be _Evidence of Truth,_ from some Beginning or Principle of _Sense_: for the Truth of a Proposition is never evident, until we conceive the Meaning of the Words or Terms whereof it consisteth, which are always Conceptions of the Mind: Nor can we remember those Conceptions, without the Thing that produced the same by our Senses. The _first_ Principle of Knowledge is, that we have such and such _Conceptions_; the _second,_ that we have thus and thus _named_ the Things whereof they are Conceptions; the _third_ is, that we have _joyned_ those _Names_ in such Manner as to make true Propositions; the _fourth_ and last is, that we have _joyned_ those _Propositions_ in such Manner as they be concluding, and the Truth of the Conclusion said to be known. And of these two Kinds of Knowledge, whereof the former is _Experience of Fact,_ and the later of _Evidence of Truth_; as the _former,_ if it be great, is called _Prudence_; so the _latter,_ if it be much, hath usually been called, both by Ancient and Modern Writers, _Sapience_ or Wisdom: and of this _latter, Man_ only is capable; of the _former, brute Beasts_ also participate.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Proposition is said to be _supposed,_ when, being _not evident,_ it is nevertheless _admitted for a Time,_ to the End, that, joyning to it other Propositions, we may _conclude_ something; and to _proceed_ from Conclusion to Conclusion, for a _Trial_ whether the same will lead us into any _absurd_ or impossible Conclusion; which if it _do,_ then we know such Supposition to have been false.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But if, running thorow _many_ Conclusions, we come to _none_ that are _absurd,_ then we think the Proposition _probable_: likewise we think probable whatsoever Proposition we _admit_ for Truth by Errour of Reasoning, or from trusting to other Men: And all such Propositions as are admitted by _Trust_ or errour, we are not said to _know,_ but _think_ them to be true; and the Admittance of them is called _Opinion._","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And particularly, when the Opinion is admitted out of _Trust_ to _other_ Men, they are said to _believe_ it; and their Admittance of it is called _Belief,_ and sometimes _Faith._","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is either _Science_ or _Opinion_ which we commonly mean by the Word _Conscience_: for Men say that such and such a thing is true in or upon their Conscience; which they _never_ do, when they think it _doubtful_; and therefore they _know,_ or _think_ they know it to be true. But Men, when they say Things upon their Conscience, are not therefore presumed certainly to know the Truth of what they say: It remaineth then, that that Word is used by them that have an _Opinion, not_ only of the _Truth_ of the Thing, _but_ also of their _Knowledge_ of it, to which the _Truth_ of the Proposition is consequent. _Conscience_ I therefore define to be _Opinion of Evidence._","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Belief,_ which is the admitting of Propositions upon _Trust,_ in many Cases is no less free from _Doubt,_ than perfect and manifest _Knowledge_: for as there is nothing whereof there is not some Cause; so, when there is Doubt, there must be some Cause thereof conceived Now there be many Things which we receive from _Report of others,_ of which it is impossible to imagine any Cause of _Doubt_: for what can be opposed against the Consent of all Men, in Things they can know, and have no Cause to report otherwise than they are, (such as is great Part of our _Histories_) unless a Man would say that all the World had _conspired_ to deceive him. And thus much of _Sense, Imagination, Discursion, Ratiocination,_ and _Knowledge,_ which are the Acts of our _Power cognitive,_ or _conceptive._ That Power of the _Mind_ which we call _motive,_ differeth from the Power _motive_ of the _Body_: for the Power _motive_ of the _Body_ is that by which it _moveth other Bodies,_ and we call _Strength_; but the Power motive of the _Mind,_ is that by which the Mind giveth _animal Motion_ to that _Body_ wherein it existeth: the Acts hereof are our _Affections_ and _Passions,_ of which I am to speak in general.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.9"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore Politico"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Cive"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Libertie and Necessitie"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Behemoth"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Answer to Bramhall"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.HN.5","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 5","breadcrumb":"Chapter 5","published":[1650]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.HN.7","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 7","breadcrumb":"Chapter 7","published":[1650]}}
