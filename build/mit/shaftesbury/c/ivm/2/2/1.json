But more particularly still may this Superiority be known, from the actual Prevalence and Ascendency of this sort of Affection over all besides. Where-ever it presents it-self with any advantage, it silences and appeases every other Motion of Pleasure. No Joy, merely of Sense, can be a Match for it. Whoever is Judg of _both_ the Pleasures, will ever give the preference to _the former._ But to be able to judg of both, 'tis necessary to have a Sense of each. The honest Man indeed can judg of _sensual Pleasure,_ and knows its utmost Force. For neither is his Taste, or Sense the duller; but, on the contrary, the more intense and clear, on the account of his Temperance, and a moderate Use of Appetite.

When we have thorowly search'd into the nature of this contemplative Delight, we shall find it of a kind which relates not in the least to any private Interest of the Creature, nor has for its Object any Self-good or Advantage of the private System. The Admiration, Joy, or Love, turns wholly upon what is exterior, and foreign to our-selves. And tho the reflected Joy or Pleasure, which arises from the notice of this Pleasure once perceiv'd, may be interpreted _a Self-passion,_ or _interested Regard:_ yet the original Satisfaction can be no other than what results from the Love of Truth, Proportion, Order, and Symmetry, in the Things without. If this be the Case, the Passion ought in reality to be rank'd with _natural Affection._ For having no Object within the compass of the private System; it must either be esteem'd superfluous and _unnatural,_ (as having no tendency towards the Advantage or Good of any thing in Nature) or it must be judg'd to be, what it truly is,[n1] \"A natural Joy in the Contemplation of those _Numbers,_ that _Harmony, Proportion,_ and _Concord,_ which supports the universal Nature, and is essential in the Constitution and Form of every particular Species, or Order of Beings.\"","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But this speculative Pleasure, however considerable and valuable it may be, or however superior to any Motion of mere Sense; must yet be far surpass'd by _virtuous Motion,_ and _the Exercise of Benignity and Goodness;_ where, together with the most delightful Affection of the Soul, there is join'd a pleasing Assent and Approbation of the Mind to what is acted in this good Disposition and honest Bent.

For tho it be mere Fancy, we endeavour still to believe it Truth; and flatter our-selves, all we can, with the Thought of _Merit_ of some kind, and the Persuasion of our deserving well from some few at least, with whom we happen to have a more intimate and familiar Commerce.","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What Tyrant is there, what Robber, or open Violater of the Laws of Society, who has not a Companion, or some particular Set, either of his own Kindred, or such as he calls Friends; with whom he gladly shares his Good; in whose Welfare he delights; and whose Joy and Satisfaction he makes _his own?_ What Person in the world is there, who receives not some Impressions from the Flattery or Kindness of such as are familiar with him? 'Tis to this soothing Hope and Expectation of Friendship, that almost all our Actions have some reference. 'Tis this which goes thro' our whole Lives, and mixes it-self even with most of our Vices. Of this, _Vanity, Ambition,_ and _Luxury,_ have a share; and many other Disorders of our Life partake. Even the unchastest _Love_ borrows largely from this Source. So that were Pleasure to be computed in the same way as other things commonly are; it might properly be said, that out of these two Branches (viz. _Community or Participation in the Pleasures of others,_ and _Belief of meriting well from others_) wou'd arise more than nine Tenths of whatever is enjoy'd in Life.

Whatever Affection we have towards any thing besides _our-selves;_ if it be not of the _natural sort_ towards the System, or Kind; it must be, of all other Affections, the most _dissociable,_ and destructive of the Enjoyments of Society: If it be really of the natural sort, and apply'd only to some _one_ Part of Society, or of a Species, but not to the Species or Society _it-self;_ there can be no more account given of it, than of the most odd, capricious, or humoursom Passion which may arise. The Person, therefore, who is conscious of this Affection, can be conscious of no _Merit_ or _Worth_ on the account of it. Nor can the Persons on whom this capricious Affection has chanc'd to fall, be in any manner secure of its Continuance or Force. As it has no Foundation or Establishment _in Reason;_ so it must be easily removable, and subject to alteration, _without Reason._ Now the Variableness of such sort of Passion, which depends solely on Capriciousness and Humour, and undergoes the frequent Successions of alternate Hatred and Love, Aversion and Inclination, must of necessity create continual Disturbance and Disgust, give an allay to what is immediately enjoy'd in the way of Friendship and Society, and in the end extinguish, in a manner, the very Inclination towards Friendship and human Commerce. Whereas, on the other hand, ^Intire Affection^ (from whence _Integrity_ has its name) as it is answerable to it-self, proportionable, and rational; so it is irrefragable, solid, and durable. And as in the case of _Partiality,_ or vitious Friendship, which has no rule or order, every Reflection of the Mind necessarily makes to its disadvantage, and lessens the Enjoyment; so in the case of _Integrity,_ the Consciousness of just Behaviour towards Mankind in general, #Partial Affection.# casts a good reflection on each friendly Affection in particular, and raises the Enjoyment of Friendship still the higher, in the way of _Community_ or _Participation_ above-mention'd.","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And in the next place, as ^partial Affection^ is fitted only to a short and slender Enjoyment of those Pleasures of _Sympathy_ or _Participation with others;_ so neither is it able to derive any considerable Enjoyment from that other principal Branch of human Happiness, _viz.

What Trust can there be to a mere _casual Inclination_ or _capricious Liking?_ Who can depend on such a Friendship as is founded on no moral Rule, but fantastically assign'd to some single Person, or small _Part_ of Mankind, exclusive of Society, and _the Whole?_","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It may be consider'd, withal, as a thing impossible; that they who esteem or love by any other Rule than that of _Virtue,_ shou'd place their Affection on such Subjects as they can long esteem or love.

We may say of it, with justice, that it carrys with it a Consciousness of merited Love and Approbation from all Society, from all intelligent Creatures, and from whatever is original to all other Intelligence. And if there be in Nature any such _Original;_ we may add, that the Satisfaction which attends _intire Affection,_ is full and noble, in proportion to its _final Object,_ which contains all Perfection; according to the Sense of _Theism_ above-noted. For this, as has been shewn, is the result of _Virtue._ And to have this ^intire Affection^ or ^Integrity^ of Mind, is _to live according to Nature,_ and the Dictates and Rules of _supreme Wisdom._ This is Morality, Justice, Piety, and natural Religion.","subId":"23","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"BUT lest this Argument shou'd appear perhaps too _scholastically_ stated, and in Terms and Phrases, which are not of familiar use; we may try whether possibly we can set it yet in a plainer light.","subId":"24","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let any-one, then, consider well those Pleasures which he receives either in private Retirement, Contemplation, Study, and Converse _with himself;_ or in Mirth, Jollity, and Entertainment with _others;_ and he will find, That they are wholly founded in _An easy Temper, free of Harshness,_ #Mind and Temper.# _Bitterness, or Distaste;_ and in _A Mind or Reason well compos'd, quiet, easy within it-self, and such as can freely bear its own Inspection and Review._ Now such ^a Mind^, and such ^a Temper^, which fit and qualify for the Enjoyment of the Pleasures mention'd, must of necessity be owing to the _natural_ and _good Affections._","subId":"25","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#TEMPER.# As to what relates to ^Temper^, it may be consider'd thus.

They are not always to be satisfy'd by mere Indulgence. And when a Life is guided by _Fancy_ only, there is sufficient ground of Contrariety and Disturbance. The very ordinary Lassitudes, Uneasinesses, and Defects of Disposition in the soundest Body; the interrupted Course of the Humours, or Spirits, in the healthiest People; and the accidental Disorders common to every Constitution, are sufficient, we know, on many occasions, to breed Uneasiness and Distaste. And this, in time, must grow into a Habit; where there is nothing to oppose its progress, and hinder its prevailing on the Temper. Now the only sound Opposite to ^Ill Humour^, is _natural_ and _kind Affection._ For we may observe, that when the Mind, upon reflection, resolves at any time to suppress this Disturbance already risen in the Temper, and sets about this reforming Work with heartiness, and in good earnest; it can no otherwise accomplish the Undertaking, than by introducing into the affectionate Part some gentle Feeling of the social and friendly kind; some enlivening Motion of Kindness, Fellowship, Complacency, or Love, to allay and convert that contrary Motion of Impatience and Discontent.","subId":"26","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If it be said perhaps, that in the case before us, _Religious Affection_ or _Devotion_ is a sufficient and proper Remedy; we answer, That 'tis according as the Kind may happily prove.

The more dismal our Thoughts are on such a Subject, the worse our Temper will be, and the readier to discover it-self in Harshness, and Austerity.

So that to want ^Conscience^, or _natural Sense of the Odiousness of Crime and Injustice,_ is to be most of all miserable in Life: but where _Conscience,_ or _Sense_ of this sort, remains; there, consequently, whatever is committed against it, must of necessity, by means of Reflection, as we have shewn, be continually shameful, grievous and offensive.","subId":"35","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.1.35"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Man who in a Passion happens to kill his Companion, relents immediately on the sight of what he has done.

If on the other side, we suppose him _not_ to relent or suffer any real Concern or Shame; then, either he has no Sense of the Deformity of the Crime and Injustice, no natural Affection, and consequently no Happiness or Peace within: or if he has any Sense of moral Worth or Goodness, it must be of a perplex'd, and contradictory kind. He must pursue an inconsistent Notion, #False Conscience.# idolize some _false Species_ of Virtue; and affect as noble, gallant, or worthy, that which is irrational and absurd. And how tormenting this must be to him, is easy to conceive. For never can such _a Phantom_ as this be reduc'd to any certain Form. Never can this ^Proteus^ of _Honour_ be held steddy, to one Shape. The Pursuit of it can only be vexatious and distracting. There is nothing beside real Virtue, as has been shewn, which can possibly hold any proportion to Esteem, Approbation, or good Conscience. And he who, being led by false Religion or prevailing Custom, has learnt to esteem or admire any thing as Virtue which is not really such; must either thro' the Inconsistency of such an Esteem, and the perpetual Immoralitys occasion'd by it, come at last to lose all Conscience, and so be miserable in the worst way: or, if he retains any Conscience at all, it must be of a kind never satisfactory, or able to bestow Content. For 'tis impossible that a cruel Enthusiast, or _Bigot,_ a Persecutor, a Murderer, a _Bravo,_ a Pirate, or any Villain of less degree, who is false to the Society of Mankind in general, and contradicts natural Affection; shou'd have any fix'd Principle at all, any real Standard or Measure by which he can regulate his Esteem, or any solid Reason by which to form his Approbation of _any one_ moral Act. And thus the more he sets up _Honour,_ or advances _Zeal;_ the worse he renders his Nature, and the more detestable his Character. The more he engages in the Love or Admiration of any Action or Practice, as great and glorious, which is in it-self morally ill and vitious; the more Contradiction and Self-disapprobation he must incur.
