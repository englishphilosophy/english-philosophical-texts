Your Over-seriousness a-while since, at such an unseasonable time, may have driven me perhaps into a contrary Extreme, by opposition to your melancholy Humour. But I have now a better Idea of that _Melan__choly_ you discover'd; and notwithstanding the humorous Turn you were pleas'd to give it, I am persuaded it has a different Foundation from any of those fantastical Causes I then assign'd to it. \"^Love,^ #LOVE.# doubtless, is at the bottom; but a nobler Love than such as common Beautys inspire.\"—","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here, in my turn, I began to raise my Voice, and imitate the solemn way you had been teaching me. \"_Knowing_ as you are,\" continu'd I, \"_well-knowing_ and experienc'd in all the Degrees and Orders of Beauty, #Beauty.# in all the mysterious Charms of the particular Forms; you rise to what is more general; and with a larger Heart, and Mind more comprehensive, you generously seek that which is highest in the kind.

For 'tis not then that Men complain of the World's Order, or abhor the Face of things, when they see various Interests mix'd and interfering; Natures subordinate, of different kinds, oppos'd one to another, and in their different Operations submitted, the higher to the lower.

The numerous Insects are reduc'd by the superior Kinds of Birds and Beasts: and these again are check'd by Man; who in his turn submits to other Natures, and resigns his Form a Sacrifice in common to the rest of Things.

But here I'll answer for it; there was nothing of Disguise or Paint. All was fair, open, and genuine, as Nature herself. 'Twas _Nature_ he was in love with: 'Twas _Nature_ he sung. And if any-one might be said to have _a natural_ Mistress, my Friend certainly might, whose Heart was thus ingag'd. But ^Love,^ I found, was every-where the same. And tho the Object here was very fine, and the Passion it created very noble; yet _Liberty,_ I thought, was finer than all: And I who never car'd to ingage in other Loves of the least continuance, was the more afraid, I told you, of this which had such a power with my poor _Friend,_ as to make him appear the perfectest ^Enthusiast^ in the World, _Ill-humour_ only excepted. For this was singular in him, \"That tho he had all of the _Enthusiast,_ he had nothing of the _Bigot._ He heard every thing with Mildness and Delight; and bore with me when I treated all his Thoughts as visionary; and when, Sceptick-like, I unravel'd all his Systems.\"","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here was that _Character_ and _Description_ which so highly pleas'd you, that you wou'd hardly suffer me to come to a conclusion.
