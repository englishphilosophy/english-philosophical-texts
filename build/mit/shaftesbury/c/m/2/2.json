But Curiosity had seiz'd you, I perceiv'd, as it had done me before. For after this first Conversation, I must own, I long'd for nothing so much as the next day, and the appointed Morning-walk in the _Woods._","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We had only a Friend or two at dinner with us; and for a good while we discours'd of News and indifferent things, till I, who had my head still running upon those other Subjects, gladly laid hold of something dropt by chance concerning _Friendship;_ #Friendship.# and said, That for my own part, truly, tho I once thought I had known Friendship, and really counted my-self _a good Friend_ during my whole Life; yet I was now persuaded to believe my-self no better than a _Learner:_ since ^Theocles^ had almost convinc'd me, \"That to be a _Friend_ to any one _in particular,_ 'twas necessary to be first _a Friend to Mankind._\" But how to qualify my-self for such a Friendship, was, methought, no little difficulty.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Indeed, said ^Theocles,^ you have given us a very indifferent Character of your-self, in saying so. If you had spoken thus of the Friendship of any _great Man_ at Court, or perhaps of _a Court_ it-self, and had complain'd, \"How hard it was for you to succeed, or make Interest with such as govern'd there\"; we shou'd have concluded in your behalf, that there were such Terms to be comply'd with, as were unworthy of you. But \"To deserve well of _the Publick,_\" and \"To be justly styl'd _the Friend of Mankind,_\" #Virtue.# requires no more than to be _good_ and _virtuous;_ Terms which for one's own sake one wou'd naturally covet.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Motives.# How comes it then, said I, that even these _good Terms_ themselves are so ill accepted, and hardly ever taken, if I may so express it, except on _further Terms?_ For ^Virtue,^ _by it-self,_ is thought but an ill Bargain: and I know few, even of the Religious and Devout, who take up with it any otherwise than as Children do with Physick; where the Rod and Sweetmeat are the potent Motives.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"They are Children indeed, reply'd ^Theocles,^ and shou'd be treated so, who need any Force or Persuasion to do what conduces to their Health and Good. But where, I beseech you, are those forbidding Circumstances which shou'd make _Virtue_ go down so hardly? Is it not, among other things, that you think your-self by this means precluded the fine Tables and costly Eating of our modern _Epicures;_ and that perhaps you fear the being reduc'd to eat always as ill as now, upon a plain Dish or two, and no more?","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This, I protested, was injuriously suppos'd of me. For I wish'd never to eat otherwise than I now did, at his Table; which, by the way, had more resemblance (I thought) of ^Epicurus'^ s, than those which now-a-days preposterously pass'd under his name. For if his Opinion might be taken, the highest Pleasures in the World were owing to _Temperance,_ and _moderate Use._","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If then the merest Studier of _Pleasure,_ (answer'd ^Theocles^ ) even ^Epicurus^ himself, made that favourable Report of _Temperance,_ #Temperance.# so different from his modern Disciples; if he cou'd boldly say, \"That with such Fare as a mean Garden afforded, he cou'd vie even with the Gods for Happiness\"; how shall we say of this part of Virtue, that it needs be _taken upon Terms?_ If the immediate Practice of _Temperance_ be thus harmless; are its Consequences injurious? Does it take from the Vigour of the Mind, consume the Body, and render both the one and the other less apt to their proper Exercises, \"the Enjoyments of Reason or Sense, or the Employments and Offices of civil Life?\" Or is it that a Man's Circumstances are the worse for it, as he stands towards his Friends, or Mankind? Is a Gentleman in this sense to be pity'd, \"As _One_ burdensom to himself, and others; _One_ whom all Men will naturally shun, as an ill Friend, and a Corrupter of Society and Good Manners?\"—Shall we consider our Gentleman in _a publick Trust,_ and see whether he is like to succeed best with this restraining Quality; or whether he may be more rely'd on, and thought more incorrupt, if his Appetites are high, and his Relish strong towards that which we call Pleasure? Shall we consider him as _a Soldier,_ in a Campain, or Siege; and advise with our-selves how we might be best defended, if we had occasion for such a one's Service? \"Which Officer wou'd make the best for the Soldiers; Which Soldier for the Officers; or Which Army for their Country?\"—What think you of our Gentleman, for _a Fellow-traveller?_ Wou'd he, as a temperate Man, be an ill Choice? Wou'd it indeed be more eligible and delightful, \"To have a Companion, who, in any shift or necessity, wou'd prove the most ravenous, and eager to provide in the first place for himself, and his own exquisite Sensations?\"—I know not what to say where _Beauty_ is concern'd. Perhaps the _amorous Galants,_ and exquisite _Refiners_ on this sort of Pleasure, may have so refin'd their Minds and Tempers, that, notwithstanding their accustom'd Indulgence, they can, upon occasion, renounce their Enjoyment, rather than violate Honour, Faith, or Justice.—And thus, at last, there will be little Virtue or Worth ascrib'd to this patient sober _Character._ \"The dull _temperate Man_ is no fitter to be trusted than the elegant _luxurious_ one. Innocence, Youth, and Fortune may be as well committed to the Care of this latter Gentleman. He wou'd prove as good _an Executor,_ as good _a Trustee,_ as good _a Guardian,_ as he wou'd _a Friend._ The Family which entrusted him wou'd be secure; and no Dishonour, in any likelihood, wou'd happen from the honest _Man of Pleasure._\"","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THE Seriousness with which ^Theocles^ spoke this, made it the more pleasant; and set our other Company upon saying a great many good things on the same Subject, in commendation of _a temperate Life._ So that our Dinner by this time being ended, and the Wine, according to Custom, plac'd before us; I found still we were in no likelihood of proceeding to a Debauch. Every-one drank only as he fansy'd, in no Order or Proportion, and with no regard to circular Healths or Pledges: A Manner which the sociable Men of another Scheme of Morals wou'd have censur'd no doubt, as a heinous Irregularity, and Corruption of _Good Fellowship._","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I own, said I, I am far from thinking ^Temperance^ so disagreeable a Character. As for this part of Virtue, I think there is no need of taking it on any other _Terms_ to recommend it, than the mere Advantage of being sav'd from Intemperance, and from the desire of things unnecessary.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How! said ^Theocles,^ are you thus far advanc'd? And can you carry this _Temperance_ so far as to Estates and Honours, by opposing it to _Avarice_ and _Ambition?_—Nay, then truly, you may be said to have fairly embark'd your-self in this Cause. You have pass'd the Channel, and are more than half-seas over. There remains no further Scruple in the case of Virtue, unless you will declare your-self _a Coward,_ or conclude it a happiness to be born one. For if you can be _temperate_ withal towards ^Life,^ and think it not so great a business, whether _it_ be of fewer or more Years; but satisfy'd with what you have liv'd, can rise a thankful Guest from a full liberal Entertainment; Is not this the Sum of all? the finishing Stroke and very Accomplishment of _Virtue?_ In this Temper of Mind, what is there can hinder us from forming for our-selves as heroick _a Character_ as we please? What is there either _good, generous,_ or _great,_ which does not naturally flow from such a modest ^Temperance?^ Let us once gain this simple plain-look'd _Virtue,_ and see whether the more shining _Virtues_ will not follow. See what that _Country of the Mind_ will produce, when by the wholesom Laws of this Legislatress it has obtain'd its _Liberty!_ #LIBERTY, Civil.# You, ^Philocles,^ who are such an Admirer of _Civil Liberty,_ and can represent it to your-self with a thousand several Graces and Advantages; can you imagine no Grace or Beauty in that original _native Liberty,_ #Moral.# which sets us free from so many in-born Tyrannys, gives us the Privilege of our-selves, and makes us _our own,_ and independent? A sort of Property, which, methinks, is as material to us to the full, as that which secures us our Lands, or Revenues.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I shou'd think, said he (carrying on his Humour) that one might draw the Picture of this _moral_ Dame to as much advantage as that of her _political_ Sister; whom you admire, as describ'd to us \"in her ^Amazon^ -_Dress,_ with a free manly Air becoming her; her Guards the _Laws,_ with their written Tables, like Bucklers, surrounding her; Riches, Traffick, and Plenty, with the _Cornucopia,_ serving as her Attendents; and in her Train the _Arts_ and _Sciences,_ like Children, playing.\"—The rest of the Piece is easy to imagine: \"Her Triumph over Tyranny, and lawless Rule of Lust and Passion.\"—But what a Triumph wou'd her Sister's be! What Monsters of savage Passions wou'd there appear subdu'd! \"There fierce _Ambition, Lust, Uproar, Misrule,_ with all the _Fiends_ which rage in human Breasts, wou'd be securely chain'd.

At last, fetching a deep Sigh, ^OPhilocles,^ said he, how well you are Master of that Cause you have taken on you to defend! How well you know the way to gain advantage to the worst of Causes, from the imprudent Management of those who defend the best!—I dare not, for my own share, affirm to you, as my worthy Friends have done, \"That 'tis _the Atheist_ alone can lay this load on _Virtue,_ and picture her thus disgracefully.\"—No—There are other over-officious and less suspected Hands, which do her perhaps more injury, tho with a better colour.","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.2.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That _Virtue_ shou'd, with any shew of Reason, be made _a Victim,_ (continu'd he, turning himself to his Guests) must have appear'd strange to you, no doubt, to hear asserted with such assurance as has been done by ^Philocles.^ You cou'd conceive no tolerable ground for such a Spectacle. In this _revers'd Triumph_ you expected perhaps to see some foreign Conqueror exalted; as either _Vice_ it-self, or _Pleasure, Wit, spurious Philosophy,_ or some _false Image of Truth_ or _Nature._ Little were you aware that the cruel Enemy oppos'd to Virtue shou'd be ^Religion^ itself! #Religion and Virtue.# But you will call to mind, that even innocently, and without any treacherous design, _Virtue_ is often treated so, by those who wou'd magnify to the utmost the Corruption of Man's Heart; and in exposing, as they pretend, the Falshood of _human Virtue,_ think to extol _Religion._ How many religious Authors, how many sacred Orators turn all their edge this way, and strike at _moral Virtue_ as a kind of _Step-dame,_ or _Rival_ to ^Religion!^ —[n1]\"_Morality_ must not be nam'd; _Nature_ has no pretence; _Reason_ is an Enemy; _Common Justice,_ Folly; and _Virtue,_ Misery.

Yet that there are many such Zealots in the World, you will acknowledg. And that there is a certain Harmony between this _Zeal_ and what you call _Atheism,_ ^Theocles,^ you hear, #Atheism.# has allow'd.—But let us hear him out; if perhaps he will be so free as to discover to us what he thinks of the generality of our religious Writers, and their Method of encountring their common Enemy, _the Atheist._ This is a Subject which possibly may need a better clearing. For 'tis notorious that the chief Opposers of Atheism write upon contrary Principles to one another, so as in a manner to confute themselves. Some of 'em hold zealously for Virtue, and are _Realists_ in the Point. Others, one may say, are only _nominal Moralists,_ #MORALISTS, Nominal, Real.# by making Virtue nothing in it-self, a Creature of Will only, or a mere Name of Fashion. 'Tis the same in natural Philosophy: Some take one Hypothesis, #Naturalists.# and some another.
