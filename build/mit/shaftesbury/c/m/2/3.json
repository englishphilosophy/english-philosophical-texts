Now the Language of the Magistrate, I must confess, has little in common with that of Philosophy.

Neither ought they perhaps in prudence to be treated with so little regard, whose Number, however small, is thought to be rather increasing; and this too among the People of no despicable Rank.

Nor was it so absurd to imagine that a quite different Method might be attempted; by which a Writer might offer Reason to these Men with so much more Favour and Advantage, as he appear'd un-prepossess'd, and willing to examine every thing with the greatest Unconcern and Indifference.

Now that there is such a principal Object as this in the World, the World alone (if I may say so) by its wise and perfect Order must evince. This Order, if indeed perfect, excludes all _real_ ^Ill.^ And that it really does so, is what our Author so earnestly maintains, by solving the best he can those untoward _Phaenomena_ and ill Signs, taken from the Course of Providence in the seemingly unequal Lot of _Virtue_ in this World.","subId":"27","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis true: tho the Appearances hold ever so strongly against _Virtue,_ and in favour of _Vice,_ the Objection which arises hence against a ^Deity^ may be easily remov'd, and all set right again on the supposal of a _future State._ This to a Christian, #Future State.# or one already convinc'd of so great a Point, is sufficient to clear every dark Cloud of Providence. For he needs not be over-and-above sollicitous as to the Fate of ^Virtue^ _in this World,_ who is secure of _Hereafter._ But the case is otherwise as to the People we are here to encounter.
