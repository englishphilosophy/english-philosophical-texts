'Tis indeed the Nature of _Fear,_ as of all other Passions, when excessive, to defeat its own End, and prevent us in the execution of what we naturally propose to our-selves as our Advantage. ^Superstition^ it-self is but a certain kind of _Fear,_ which possessing us strongly with the apprehended Wrath or Displeasure of _Divine Powers,_ hinders us from judging what those _Powers_ are in themselves, or what Conduct of ours may, with best reason, be thought sutable to such highly rational and superior Natures. Now if from the Experience of many gross Delusions of a superstitious kind, the Course of this Fear begins to turn; 'tis natural for it to run, with equal violence, a contrary way. The extreme Passion for religious Objects passes into an Aversion. And a certain _Horror_ and _Dread of Imposture_ causes as great a Disturbance as even _Imposture it-self_ had done before. In such a Situation as this, the Mind may easily be blinded; as well in one respect, as in the other. 'Tis plain, _both_ these Disorders carry something with them which discover us to be in some manner beside our Reason, and out of the right use of Judgment and Understanding.

What the Zeal was of many early Christians against the Idolatry of the old Heathen Church (at that time the establish'd one) may be comprehended by any Person who is ever so slenderly vers'd in the History of those Times. Nor can it be said indeed of us Moderns, that in the quality of _good Christians_ (as that Character is generally understood) we are found either backward or scrupulous in assigning to Perdition such Wretches as we pronounce _guilty of Idolatry_. The name _Idolater_ is sufficient Excuse for almost any kind of Insult against the Person, and much more against the Worship of such a Mis-Believer. The very word _Christian_ is in common Language us'd for _Man_, in opposition to _Brute-Beast_, without leaving so much as a middle place for the poor _Heathen_ or _Pagan_: who, as the greater Beast of the two, is naturally doom'd to Massacre, and his Gods and Temples to Fracture and Demolishment. Nor are we masters of this Passion, even in our best humour. The _French_ Poets, we see, can with great Success, and general Applause, exhibit this primitive Zeal even on the publick Stage: [^Polyeucte^, Act II. Sc. 6.] \"\"$Ne perdons plus de temps, le Sacrifice est prêt. // Allons y du vray Dieu soutenir l'intérêt, // Allons fouler aux piés ce Foudre ridicule // Dont arme un bois pourri ce Peuple trop credule; // Allons en éclairer l'aveuglement fatal, // Allons briser ces Dieux de Pierre & de Metau: // Abandonnons nos jours à cette ardeur celeste, // Faisons triompher Dieu; qu'il dispose du reste.$\"\" I shou'd scarce have mention'd this, but that it came into my mind how ill a Construction some People have endeavour'd to make of what our Author, stating the Case of Heathen and Christian Persecution, in his _Letter of Enthusiasm_, has said concerning the Emperor ^Julian^. It was no more indeed than had been said of that virtuous and gallant Emperor by his greatest Enemys; even by those who, to the shame of Christianity, boasted of his having been most insolently affronted on all occasions, and even treacherously assassinated by one of his Christian Soldiers. As for such Authors as these, shou'd I cite them in their proper invective Style and Saint-like Phrase, they wou'd make no very agreeable appearance, especially in _Miscellanys_ of the kind we have here undertaken. But a Letter of that elegant and witty Emperor, may not be improperly plac'd amongst our Citations, as a Pattern of his Humour and Genius, as well as of his Principle and Sentiments, on this occasion. [^Julian^'s _Epistles_, Numb. 52.] \"\"^Julian^ to the ^Bostrens^. // \"_I should have thought, indeed, that the _Galilaean_ Leaders wou'd have esteem'd themselves more indebted to me, than to him who preceded me in the Administration of the Empire. For in his time, many of them suffer'd Exile, Persecution, and Imprisonment. Multitudes of those whom in their Religion they term _Hereticks_, were put to the sword. Insomuch that in _Samosata_, _Cyzicum_, _Paphlagonia_, _Bithynia_, _Galatia_, and many other Countrys, whole Towns were level'd with the Earth. The just Reverse of this has been observ'd in my time. The Exiles have been recall'd; and the Proscrib'd restor'd to the lawful Possession of their Estates. But to that height of Fury and Distraction are this People arriv'd, that being no longer allow'd the Privilege to tyrannize over one another, or persecute either their own Sectarys, or the Religious of the lawful Church, they swell with rage, and leave no stone unturn'd, no opportunity unimploy'd, of raising Tumult and Sedition. So little regard have they to true Piety; so little Obedience to our Laws and Constitutions; however humane and tolerating. For still do we determine and steddily resolve, never to suffer one of them to be drawn involuntarily to our Altars. \\* \\* \\* As for the mere People, indeed, they appear driven to these Riots and Seditions by those amongst them whom they call CLERICKS: who are now enrag'd to find themselves restrain'd in the use of their former Power and intemperate Rule. \\* \\* \\* They can no longer act the Magistrate or Civil Judg, nor assume Authority to make Peoples _Wills_, supplant Relations, possess themselves of other Mens Patrimonys, and by specious Pretences transfer _all_ into their own possession. \\* \\* \\* For this reason I have thought fit, by this _Publick EDICT_, to forewarn the People of this sort, that they raise no more Commotions, nor gather in a riotous manner about their seditious CLERICKS, in defiance of the Magistrate, who has been insulted and in danger of being ston'd by these incited Rabbles. In their Congregations they may, notwithstanding, assemble as they please, and croud about their Leaders, performing Worship, receiving Doctrine, and praying, according as they are by them taught and conducted: But if with any Tendency to Sedition; let them beware how they hearken, or give assent; and remember, 'tis at their peril, if by these means they are secretly wrought up to Mutiny and Insurrection. \\* \\* \\* Live, therefore, in Peace and Quietness! neither spitefully opposing, or injuriously treating one another. You misguided People of the new way, Beware, on your side! And you of the antient and establish'd Church, injure not your Neighbours and Fellow-Citizens, who are enthusiastically led away, in Ignorance and Mistake, rather than with Design or Malice! 'Tis by DISCOURSE and REASON, not by _Blows_, _Insults_, or _Violence_, that Men are to be inform'd of Truth, and convinc'd of Error. Again therefore and again I enjoin and charge the zealous Followers of the true Religion, no way to injure, molest, or affront the _Galilaean_ People._\"\"\" Thus the generous and mild Emperor; whom we may indeed call _Heathen_, but not so justly _Apostate_: since being, at different times of his Youth, transfer'd to different Schools or Universitys, and bred under Tutors of each Religion, as well _Heathen_ as _Christian_; he happen'd, when of full age, to make his choice (tho very unfortunately) in the former kind, and adher'd to the antient Religion of his Country and Forefathers.
