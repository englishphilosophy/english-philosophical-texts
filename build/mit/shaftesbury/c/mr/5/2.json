Tho they bear different Titles, and are set up to maintain contrary Points; they are found, at the bottom, to be all of the same side; and, notwithstanding their seeming Variance, to co-operate in the most officious manner with the Author, towards the display of his own proper Wit, and the establishment of his private Opinion and Maxims. They are indeed his very legitimate and obsequious _Puppets;_ as like _real Men_ in Voice, Action, and Manners, as those wooden or wire Engines of the lower Stage. ^Philotheus^ and ^Philatheus,Philautus^ and ^Philalethes^ are of one and the same Order: Just Tallys to one another: Questioning and Answering in concert, and with such a sort of Alternative as is known in a vulgar Play, where _one_ Person lies down blindfold, and presents himself, as fair as may be, to _another,_ who by favour of the Company, or the assistance of his Good-fortune, deals his Companion many a sound Blow, without being once challeng'd, or brought into his Turn of _lying down._","subId":"28","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.28"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is the same curious Mixture of _Chance,_ and _elegant Vicissitude,_ in the Style of these Mock-Personages of our new _Theological Drama:_ with this difference only, \"That after the poor Phantom or Shadow of an Adversary has said as little for his Cause as can be imagin'd, and given as many Opens and Advantages as cou'd be desir'd, he _lies down_ for good and all, and passively submits to the killing Strokes of his unmerciful Conqueror.\"","subId":"29","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Hardly, as I conceive, will it be objected to our ^Moralist,^ (the Author of the _philosophick Dialogue_ above) \"That the Personages who sustain the _sceptical_ or _objecting Parts,_ are over-tame and tractable in their Disposition.\" Did I perceive any such foul dealing in his Piece; I shou'd scarce think it worthy of the Criticism here bestow'd.

Allow your Adversary his full Reason, his Ingenuity, Sense, and Art. Trust to the _chief Character_ or ^Hero^ _of your Piece._ Make him as dazling _bright,_ as you are able. He will undoubtedly overcome the utmost Force of his Opponent, and dispel the Darkness or Cloud, which the Adversary may unluckily have rais'd. But if when you have fairly wrought up your _Antagonist_ to his due Strength and cognizable Proportion, your _chief Character_ cannot afterwards prove a match for him, or shine with a superior Brightness; Whose Fault is it?—The _Subject's?_—This, I hope, you will never allow.—Whose, therefore, beside _your own?_—Beware then; and consider well your Strength and Mastership in this manner of Writing, and in the qualifying Practice of the polite World, ere you attempt these accurate and refin'd Limnings or Portraitures of Mankind, or offer to bring _Gentlemen_ on the Stage. For if _real Gentlemen,_ seduc'd, as you pretend, and made erroneous in their Religion or Philosophy, discover not the least Feature of their real Faces in your Looking-glass, nor know themselves, in the least, by your Description; they will hardly be apt to think they are refuted. How wittily soever your Comedy may be wrought up, they will scarce apprehend any of that Wit to fall upon themselves. They may laugh indeed at the Diversion you are pleas'd to give 'em: But _the Laugh_ perhaps may be different from what you intend.

'Tis _a Sceptick_ recites: and the Hero of the Piece passes for _an Enthusiast._ If a perfect Character be wanting; 'tis the same Case here, as with the Poets in some of their best Pieces. And this surely is a sufficient Warrant for the Author of a PHILOSOPHICAL ROMANCE.\"—Thus our Author himself; who to conceal, however, his strict Imitation of the antient _poetick_ DIALOGUE, has prefix'd an auxiliary Title to his Work, and given it the Sirname of RHAPSODY: As if it were merely of that _Essay_ or _mix'd_ kind of Works, which come abroad with an affected Air of Negligence and Irregularity. But whatever our Author may have affected in his _Title-Page,_ 'twas so little his Intention to write after that Model of incoherent Workmanship, that it appears to be sorely against his Will, if this _Dialogue-Piece_ of his has not the just Character, and correct Form of those antient _Poems_ describ'd. He wou'd gladly have constituted ONE single _Action_ and _Time,_ sutable to the just Simplicity of those Dramatick Works. And this, one wou'd think, was easy enough for him to have done. He needed only to have brought his first Speakers immediately into Action, and sav'd the _narrative_ or _recitative_ Part of ^Philocles^ _to_ ^Palemon,^ by producing them as speaking Personages upon his Stage. The Scene all along might have been _the Park._ From the early Evening to the late Hour of Night, that the two Galants withdrew to their Town-Apartments, there was sufficient time for the Narrator ^Philocles,^ to have _recited_ the whole Transaction of the second and third Part; which wou'd have stood thro'out as it now does: only at the Conclusion, when the _narrative_ or _recitative Part_ had ceas'd, the _simple_ and _direct_ DIALOGUE wou'd have again return'd, to grace the _Exit._ By this means the _temporal_ as well as _local_ Unity of the Piece had been preserv'd.
