If Authors writ _ill,_ they were despis'd: If _well,_ they were by some Party or other espous'd. For _Partys_ there wou'd necessarily be, and _Sects_ of every kind, in Learning and Philosophy. Every one sided with whom he lik'd; and having the liberty of hearing _each_ side speak for it-self, stood in no need of express _Warning-Pieces_ against pretended Sophistry, or dangerous Reasoning. Particular _Answers_ to single Treatises, were thought to be of little use. And it was esteem'd no Compliment to a Reader, to help him so carefully in the Judgment of every Piece which came abroad. Whatever _Sects_ there were in those days, the Zeal of _Party_-causes ran not so high as to give the Reader a Taste of those _personal_ Reproaches, which might pass in a Debate between the different _Partymen._","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus Matters stood of old; when as yet the Method of writing _Controversy_ was not rais'd into an _Art,_ nor the Feuds of contending Authors become the chief Amusement of the learned World. But we have at present so high a Relish of this kind, that the Writings of the Learned are never truly gustful till they are come to what we may properly enough call _their due Ripeness,_ and have begot a _Fray._ When the _Answer_ and _Reply_ is once form'd, our Curiosity is excited: We begin then, for the first time, to whet our Attention, and apply our Ear.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For example: Let a zealous _Divine_ and flaming Champion of our Faith, when inclin'd to shew himself in Print, make choice of some tremendous _Mystery_ of Religion, oppos'd heretofore by some damnable _Heresiarch;_ whom having vehemently refuted, he turns himself towards the orthodox Opinion, and supports the true Belief, with the highest Eloquence and profoundest Erudition; he shall, notwithstanding this, remain perhaps in deep Obscurity, to the great affliction of his Bookseller, and the regret of all who bear a just Veneration for _Church-history,_ and the antient Purity of the _Christian_ Faith. But let it so happen that in this Prosecution of his deceas'd Adversary, our _Doctor_ raises up some _living Antagonist;_ who, on the same foot of Orthodoxy with himself, pretends to arraign his Expositions, and refute the Refuter upon every Article he has advanc'd; from this moment the Writing gathers Life, the Publick listens, the Bookseller takes heart; and when Issue is well join'd, the Repartees grown smart, and the Contention vigorous between the learned Partys, _a Ring_ is made, and _Readers_ gather in abundance. Every one _takes party,_ and encourages his _own_ Side. \"This shall be my Champion!—This Man for my Money!—Well hit, on our side!—Again, a good Stroke!—There he was even with him!—Have at him the next Bout!\"—Excellent Sport! And when the _Combatants_ are for a-while drawn off, and each retir'd with his own Companions; What _Praises,_ and _Congratulations!_ What _Applauses_ of the suppos'd _Victor!_ And how honourably is he saluted by his Favourers, and complimented even to the disturbance of his Modesty! \"Nay, but Gentlemen!—Good Gentlemen! Do you really think thus?—Are you sincere with me?—Have I treated my Adversary as he deserves?\" \"Never was Man so maul'd. Why you have kill'd him downright.\" \"O, Sirs! you flatter me.\" \"He can never rise more.\" \"Think ye so indeed?\" \"Or if he shou'd; 'twou'd be a Pleasure to see how you wou'd handle him.\"","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These are the Triumphs. This what sets _sharp:_ This gives the Author his _Edge,_ and excites the Reader's Attention; when the Trumpets are thus sounded to the Croud, and a kind of _Amphitheatrical_ Entertainment exhibited to the Multitude, by these _Gladiatorian_ Pen-men.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Author of the preceding Treatises being by profession a nice _Inspector_ into _the Ridicule_ of Things, must in all probability have rais'd to himself some such Views as these, which hinder'd him from engaging in the way of _Controversy._ For when, by accident, the[n1] First of these Treatises (_a private Letter,_ and in the Writer's Esteem, little worthy of the Publick's notice) came to be read abroad in Copys, and afterwards in Print; the smartest _Answers_ which came out against it, cou'd not, it seems, move our Author to form any _Reply._ All he was heard to say in return, was, \"That he thought whoever had taken upon him to publish a Book in answer to that casual Piece, had certainly made either a very high Compliment to the Author, or a very ill one to the Publick.\"","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must be own'd, that when a Writer of any kind is so considerable as to deserve the Labour and Pains of some shreud Heads to refute him in publick, he may, in the quality of _an Author,_ be justly congratulated on that occasion. 'Tis suppos'd necessarily that he must have writ with some kind of Ability or Wit. But if his _original_ Performance be in truth no better than ordinary; his _Answerer's_ Task must certainly be very mean. He must be very indifferently imploy'd, who wou'd take upon him to answer Nonsense in form, ridicule what is of it-self _a Jest,_ and put it upon the World to read _a second Book_ for the sake of the Impertinencys of _a former._","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Taking it, however, for granted, \"That a sorry Treatise may be the foundation of a considerable Answer;\" a _Reply_ still must certainly be ridiculous, which-ever way we take it. For either the Author, in his original Piece, has been truly refuted, or not. If refuted; why does he defend? If not refuted; why trouble himself? What has the Publick to do with his private Quarrels, or his Adversary's Impertinence? Or supposing the World out of curiosity may delight to see _a Pedant_ expos'd by a Man of better Wit, and _a Controversy_ thus unequally carry'd on between two such opposite Partys; How long is this Diversion likely to hold good? And what will become of these _polemick_ Writings a few Years hence? What is already become of those mighty _Controversys,_ with which some of the most eminent Authors amus'd the World within the memory of the youngest Scholar? An _original_ Work or two may perhaps remain: But for the subsequent _Defenses,_ the _Answers, Rejoinders,_ and _Replications;_ they have been long since paying their attendance to the _Pastry-cooks._ Mankind perhaps were heated at that time, when first those Matters were debated: But they are now cool again. They laugh'd: They carry'd on the Humour: They blew the Coals: They teaz'd, and set on, maliciously, and to create themselves diversion. But the _Jest_ is now over. No-one so much as inquires Where the _Wit_ was; or Where possibly the _Sting_ shou'd lie of those notable Reflections and satirical Hints, which were once found so pungent, and gave the Readers such high Delight.—Notable _Philosophers_ and _Divines,_ who can be contented to make sport, and write in learned _Billingsgate,_ to divert the Coffee-house, and entertain the Assemblys at Booksellers Shops, or the more airy Stalls of inferior Book-retailers!","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must be allow'd, That in this respect, _controversial Writing_ is not so wholly unprofitable; and that for _Book_-Merchants, of whatever Kind or Degree, they undoubtedly receive no small Advantage from a right Improvement of _a learned Scuffle._ Nothing revives 'em more, or makes a quicker Trade, than a _Pair_ of substantial _Divines_ or grave _Philosophers,_ well match'd, and soundly back'd; till by long worrying one another, they are grown out of breath, and have almost lost their Force of Biting.—\"So have I known a crafty _Glazier,_ in time of Frost, procure a _Football,_ to draw into the Street the emulous Chiefs of the robust Youth. The tumid Bladder bounds at every Kick, bursts the withstanding _Casements,_ the _Chassys, Lanterns,_ and all the brittle vitrious _Ware._ The Noise of Blows and Out-cries fills the whole Neighbourhood; and Ruins of Glass cover the stony Pavements; till the bloated _battering Engine,_ subdu'd by force of Foot and Fist, and yielding up its Breath at many a fatal Cranny, becomes lank and harmless, sinks in its Flight, and can no longer uphold the Spirit of the contending Partys.\"","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This our Author supposes to have been the occasion of his being so often and zealously complimented by his _Amanuensis_ (for so he calls[n2] his Bookseller or Printer) on the Fame of his first Piece.
