One wou'd think it were easy to understand, that Provocation and Offence, Anger, Revenge, Jealousy in point of Honour or Power, Love of Fame, Glory, and the like, belong only to limited Beings, and are necessarily excluded a Being which is perfect and universal. But if we have never settled with our-selves any Notion of what is _morally excellent_; or if we cannot trust to that Reason which tells us, that nothing beside _what is so_, can have place in _the_ ^Deity^; we can neither trust to any thing which others relate of him, or which he himself reveals to us. We must be satisfy'd before-hand, that he is _good_, and cannot deceive us. Without this, there can be no real religious Faith, or Confidence. Now, if there be really something previous to Revelation, some antecedent Demonstration of Reason, to assure us that ^God^ _is_, and withal, that he is _so good_ as not to deceive us; the same Reason, if we will trust to it, will demonstrate to us, that ^God^ is _so good_ as to exceed the very best of us _in_ _Goodness_. And after this manner we can have no Dread or Suspicion to render us uneasy: for it is _Malice_ only, and not _Goodness_, which can make us afraid.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is an odd way of reasoning, but in certain Distempers of Mind very sovereign to those who can apply it; and it is this: \"There can be no Malice but where Interests are oppos'd. A universal Being can have no Interest opposite; and therefore can have no Malice.\" If there be _a general Mind_, it can have no _particular_ Interest: But the general Good, or Good of the Whole, and its own private Good, must of necessity be one and the same. It can intend nothing besides, nor aim at any thing beyond, nor be provok'd to any thing contrary. So that we have only to consider, whether there be really such a thing as _a Mind which has relation to the Whole_, or not. For if unhappily there be _no Mind_, we may comfort our selves, however, that Nature has _no Malice_: If there be really _a_ ^Mind^, we may rest satisfy'd, that it is _the best-natur'd one in the World_. The last Case, one wou'd imagine, shou'd be the most comfortable; and the Notion of a _common Parent_ less frightful than that of _forlorn Nature_, and _a fatherless World_. Tho, as Religion stands amongst us, there are many good People who wou'd have less Fear in being thus expos'd; and wou'd be easier, perhaps, in their Minds, if they were assur'd they had only mere _Chance_ to trust to. For no body trembles to think there shou'd be _no God_; but rather that there _shou'd be one_. This however wou'd be otherwise, if _Deity_ were thought as kindly of as _Humanity_; and we cou'd be persuaded to believe, that if there really was _a_ ^God^, _the highest Goodness_ must of necessity belong to him, without any of those[n1] Defects of Passion, those Meannesses and Imperfections which we acknowledg such in our-selves, which as good Men we endeavour all we can to be superior to, and which we find we every day conquer as we grow better.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Methinks, my Lord, it wou'd be well for us, if before[n2] we ascended into the higher Regions of _Divinity_, we wou'd vouchsafe to descend a little into _our-selves_, and bestow some poor Thoughts upon plain honest _Morals_. When we had once look'd into our-selves, and distinguish'd well the nature of our own Affections, we shou'd probably be fitter Judges of _the Divineness_ of a Character, and discern better what Affections were sutable or unsutable to _a perfect Being_. We might then understand how to _love_ and _praise_, when we had acquir'd some consistent Notion of what was _laudable_ or _lovely_. Otherwise we might chance to do ^God^ little Honour, when we intended him the most. For 'tis hard to imagine what Honour can arise to _the_ ^Deity^ from the Praises of Creatures, who are unable to discern what is _praise-worthy_ or _excellent_ in their own kind.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If a Musician were cry'd up to the Skies by a certain Set of People who had no Ear in Musick, he wou'd surely be put to the blush; and cou'd hardly, with a good Countenance, accept the Benevolence of his Auditors, till they had acquir'd a more competent Apprehension of him, and cou'd by their own Senses find out something really good in his Performance. Till this were brought about, there wou'd be little _Glory_ in the case; and the Musician, tho ever so vain, wou'd have little reason to be contented.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"They who affect Praise the most, had rather not be taken notice of, than be impertinently applauded. I know not how it comes about, that ^He^ who is ever said to do Good the most disinterestedly, shou'd be thought desirous of being prais'd so lavishly, and be suppos'd to set so high a Rate upon so cheap and low a Thing, as _ignorant Commendation_ and _forc'd Applause_.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not the same with _Goodness_ as with other Qualitys, which we may understand very well, and yet not possess. We may have an excellent Ear in _Musick_, without being able to perform in any kind. We may judg well of _Poetry_, without being Poets, or possessing the least of a Poetick Vein: But we can have no tolerable Notion of _Goodness_, without being tolerably _good_. So that if the _Praise_ of a Divine Being be so great a part of his Worship, we shou'd, methinks, learn _Goodness_, were it for nothing else than that we might learn, in some tolerable manner, how _to praise_. For the praise of Goodness from an unsound hollow Heart, must certainly make the greatest Dissonance in the world.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.5.6"},{"type":"note","content":"For my own part, says honest ^=Plutarch=^, I had rather Men shou'd say of me, \"That there neither is, nor ever was such a one as ^=Plutarch=^;\" than they should say, \"There was a ^=Plutarch=^, an unsteddy, changeable, easily provokable, and revengeful Man; $Ἄνθρωπος ἀβέβαιος, εὐμετάβολος, εὐχερὴς πρὸς ὄργην, μικρόλυπος, &c.$\" [_Plutarch_ de Superstitione.] See [VOL.
