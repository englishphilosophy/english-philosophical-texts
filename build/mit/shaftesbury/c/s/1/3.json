Of the former kind are either those good _Rusticks,_ who have been bred remote from the form'd Societys of Men; or those plain _Artizans,_ and People of lower Rank, who living in Citys and Places of resort, have been necessitated however to follow mean Imployments, and wanted the Opportunity and Means to form themselves after the better Models. There are some Persons indeed so happily form'd by Nature her-self, that with the greatest Simplicity or Rudeness of Education, they have still something of a natural Grace and Comeliness in their Action: And there are others of a better Education, who by a wrong Aim and injudicious Affectation of Grace, are of all People the farthest remov'd from it. 'Tis undeniable however, that the Perfection of Grace and Comeliness in Action and Behaviour, can be found only among the People of a liberal Education. And even among the graceful of this kind, those still are found the gracefullest, who early in their Youth have learnt their Exercises, and form'd their Motions under the best _Masters._","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now such as these _Masters_ and their Lessons are to _a fine Gentleman,_ such are _Philosophers,_ and Philosophy, to _an Author._ The Case is the same in the _fashionable,_ and in the _literate_ World. In the former of these 'tis remark'd, that by the help of good Company, and the force of Example merely, a decent Carriage is acquir'd, with such apt Motions and such a Freedom of Limbs, as on all ordinary occasions may enable the Party to demean himself like a Gentleman. But when upon further occasion, trial is made in an extraordinary way; when Exercises of the genteeler kind are to be perform'd _in publick,_ 'twill easily appear who of the Pretenders have been form'd by Rudiments, and had Masters _in private;_ and who, on the other side, have contented themselves with bare Imitation, and learnt their Part casually and by rote. The Parallel is easily made on the side of _Writers._ They have at least as much need of learning the several Motions, Counterpoises and Balances of the Mind and Passions, as the other Students those of the Body and Limbs.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"[n1]Sound knowledge is the first requisite for writing well; the books of Socrates' school will yield you the matter.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The _Galant,_ no doubt, may pen a Letter to his Mistress, as _the Courtier_ may a Compliment to _the Minister,_ or the Minister to _the Favourite_ above him, without going such vast Depths into Learning or Philosophy. But for these privileg'd Gentlemen, tho they set Fashions and prescribe Rules in other Cases, they are no Controulers in the Commonwealth of Letters. Nor are they presum'd to write to the Age, or for remote Posterity. Their Works are not of a nature to intitle 'em to hold the Rank of _Authors,_ or be styl'd _Writers_ by way of Excellence in the kind. Shou'd their Ambition lead 'em into such a Field, they wou'd be oblig'd to come otherwise equip'd. They who enter the publick Lists, must come duly train'd, and exercis'd, like well appointed Cavaliers, expert in Arms, and well instructed in the Use of their Weapon, and Management of their Steed. For to be well accouter'd, and well mounted, is not sufficient. The Horse alone can never make _the Horseman;_ nor Limbs _the Wrestler_ or _the Dancer._ No more can a Genius alone make _a Poet;_ or good Parts _a Writer,_ in any considerable kind. The Skill and Grace of Writing is founded, as our wise Poet tells us, in _Knowledg_ and _good Sense:_ and not barely in that Knowledg, which is to be learnt from common Authors, or the general Conversation of the World; but from those particular Rules of Art, which Philosophy alone exhibits.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Philosophical Writings, to which our Poet in his _Art of Poetry_ refers, were in themselves a kind of _Poetry,_ like the[n2] _Mimes,_ or personated Pieces of early times, before _Philosophy_ was in vogue, and when as yet _Dramatical Imitation_ was scarce form'd; or at least, in many Parts, not brought to due perfection. They were Pieces which, besides their force of Style, and hidden Numbers, carry'd a sort of _Action_ and _Imitation,_ the same as the _Epick_ and _Dramatick_ kinds. They were either real _Dialogues,_ or Recitals of such _personated Discourses;_ where the Persons themselves had their Characters preserv'd thro'out; their Manners, Humours, and distinct Turns of Temper and Understanding maintain'd, according to the most exact _poetical Truth._ 'Twas not enough that these Pieces treated fundamentally of _Morals,_ and in consequence pointed out _real Characters_ and _Manners:_ They exhibited 'em _alive,_ and set the Countenances and Complexions of Men plainly in view. And by this means they not only taught Us to know _Others;_ but, what was principal and of highest virtue in 'em, they taught us to know _Our-selves._","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Philosophical _Hero_ of these Poems, whose Name they carry'd both in their Body and Front, and whose Genius and Manner they were made to represent, was in himself _a perfect Character;_ yet, in some respects, so veil'd, and in a Cloud, that to the unattentive Surveyor he seem'd often to be very different from what he really was: and this chiefly by reason of a certain exquisite and refin'd Raillery which belong'd to his Manner, and by virtue of which he cou'd treat the highest Subjects, and those of the commonest Capacity both together, and render 'em explanatory of each other. So that in this Genius of writing, there appear'd both _the heroick_ and _the simple, the tragick,_ and _the comick Vein._ However, it was so order'd, that notwithstanding the Oddness or Mysteriousness of the principal Character, the _Under-parts_ or _second Characters_ shew'd human Nature more distinctly, and to the Life. We might here, therefore, as in a _Looking-Glass,_ discover our-selves, and see our minutest Features nicely delineated, and suted to our own Apprehension and Cognizance. No-one who was ever so little a-while an Inspector, cou'd fail of becoming acquainted with his own Heart. And, what was of singular note in these _magical Glasses,_ it wou'd happen, that by constant and long Inspection, the Partys accustom'd to the Practice, wou'd acquire a peculiar _speculative Habit;_ so as virtually to carry about with 'em a sort of _Pocket-Mirrour,_ always ready, and in use. In this, there were _Two_ Faces which wou'd naturally present themselves to our view: _One_ of them, like the commanding Genius, the Leader and Chief above-mention'd; the _other_ like that rude, undisciplin'd and headstrong Creature, whom we our-selves in our natural Capacity most exactly resembled. Whatever we were employ'd in, whatever we set about; if once we had acquir'd the habit of this _Mirrour;_ we shou'd, by virtue of the double Reflection, distinguish our-selves into two different Partys. And in this _Dramatick_ Method, the Work of _Self-Inspection_ wou'd proceed with admirable Success.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis no wonder that the primitive Poets were esteem'd such _Sages_ in their Times; since it appears, they were such well-practis'd _Dialogists,_ and accustom'd to this improving Method, before ever Philosophy had adopted it. Their _Mimes_ or characteriz'd Discourses were as much relish'd, as their most regular Poems; and were the Occasion perhaps that so many of these latter were form'd in such perfection. For Poetry it-self was defin'd _an Imitation_ chiefly of Men and Manners: and was that in an exalted and noble degree, which in a low one we call _Mimickry._ 'Tis in this that the great[n3] _Mimographer,_ the Father and Prince of Poets, excels so highly; his Characters being wrought to a Likeness beyond what any succeeding Masters were ever able to describe. Nor are his Works, which are so full of Action, any other than an artful Series or Chain of _Dialogues,_ which turn upon _one_ remarkable _Catastrophe_ or Event. He describes no Qualitys or Virtues; censures no Manners: makes no Encomiums, nor gives Characters himself; but brings his Actors still in view. 'Tis they who shew themselves. 'Tis they who speak in such a manner, as distinguishes 'em in all things from all others, and makes 'em ever like themselves. Their different Compositions and Allays so justly made, and equally carry'd on, thro' every particle of the Action, give more Instruction than all the Comments or Glosses in the world. The Poet, instead of giving himself those dictating and masterly Airs of Wisdom, makes hardly any figure at all, and is scarce discoverable in his Poem. This is being truly _a Master._ He paints so as to need no Inscription over his Figures, to tell us what they are, or what he intends by 'em. A few words let fall, on any slight occasion, from any of the Partys he introduces, are sufficient to denote their Manners and distinct Character. From a Finger or a Toe, he can represent to our Thoughts the Frame and Fashion of a whole Body. He wants no other help of Art, to personate his Heroes, and make 'em living. There was no more left for _Tragedy_ to do after him, than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into Scenes; turning, in the same manner, upon one principal Action or Event, with that regard to Place and Time which was sutable to a real Spectacle. Even[n4] _Comedy_ it-self was adjudg'd to this great Master; it being deriv'd from those _Parodys_ or Mock-Humours, of which he had given the[n5] Specimen in a conceal'd sort of Raillery intermix'd with the Sublime.—A dangerous Stroke of Art! and which requir'd a masterly Hand, like that of the philosophical Hero, whose Character was represented in the _Dialogue-Writings_ above-mention'd.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From hence possibly we may form a Notion of that Resemblance, which on so many occasions was heretofore remark'd between the Prince of Poets, and the Divine Philosopher, who was said to rival him, and who together with his Contemporarys of the same School, writ wholly in that manner of _Dialogue_ above-describ'd. From hence too we may comprehend perhaps, why the Study of Dialogue was heretofore thought so advantageous to _Writers,_ and why this manner of Writing was judg'd so difficult, which at first sight, it must be own'd, appears the easiest of any.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have formerly wonder'd indeed why a _Manner,_ which was familiarly us'd in Treatises upon most Subjects, with so much Success among the Antients, shou'd be so insipid and of little esteem with us Moderns. But I afterwards perceiv'd, that besides the difficulty of the _Manner_ it-self, and that _Mirrour-Faculty,_ which we have observ'd it to carry in respect of _our-selves,_ it proves also of necessity a kind of Mirrour or Looking-Glass to _the Age._ If so; it shou'd of consequence (you'll say) be the more agreeable and entertaining.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"True; if the real View of our-selves be not perhaps displeasing to us.

For are we not as handsom, at least _in our own eyes?_ Perhaps not: as we shall see, when we have consider'd a little further what the force is of this _Mirrour-Writing,_ and how it differs from that more complaisant modish way, in which an Author, instead of presenting us with other natural Characters, sets off his own with the utmost Art, and purchases his Reader's Favour by all imaginable Compliances and Condescensions.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"AN AUTHOR who writes in his own Person, has the advantage of being _who_ or _what_ he pleases.

All turns upon their two Persons. And as in an Amour, or Commerce of Love-Letters; so here the Author has the Privilege of talking eternally of himself, dressing and sprucing himself up; whilst he is making diligent court, and working upon the Humour of the Party to whom he addresses. This is the _Coquetry_ of a modern Author; whose Epistles Dedicatory, Prefaces, and Addresses to the Reader, are so many affected Graces, design'd to draw the Attention from the Subject, towards _Himself;_ and make it be generally observ'd, not so much _what he says,_ as _what he appears,_ or _is,_ and what figure he already makes, or hopes to make, in the fashionable World.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These are the Airs which a neighbouring Nation give themselves, more particularly in what they call their _Memoirs._ Their very Essays on Politicks, their Philosophical and Critical Works, their Comments upon antient and modern Authors, all their Treatises are _Memoirs._ The whole Writing of this Age is become indeed a sort of _Memoir-Writing._ Tho in the real Memoirs of the Antients, even when they writ at any time concerning themselves, there was neither the _I_ nor ^Thou^ thro'out the whole Work.

You are not only left to judg coolly, and with indifference, of the Sense deliver'd; but of the Character, Genius, Elocution, and Manner of the Persons who deliver it. These two are mere Strangers, in whose favour you are no way engag'd. Nor is it enough that the Persons introduc'd speak pertinent and good Sense, at every turn. It must be seen _from what Bottom_ they speak; from what _Principle,_ what _Stock_ or _Fund_ of Knowledg they draw; and what Kind or Species of Understanding they possess. For the Understanding here must have its Mark, its characteristick Note, by which it may be distinguish'd. It must be _such and such an Understanding;_ as when we say, for instance, _such or such a Face:_ since Nature has characteriz'd Tempers and Minds as peculiarly as Faces.

For we have not surely the same Notion of the Poet's Excellence as of the ordinary Craftsman's, the Subject of whose Art is sensless Stone or Timber, without Life, Dignity, or Beauty: whilst the Poet's Art turning principally on Men and Manners, he has his Virtue and Excellence, _as Poet,_ naturally annex'd to human Excellence, and to the Worth and Dignity of Man.
