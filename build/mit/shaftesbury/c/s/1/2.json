For it wou'd infallibly be prov'd a kind of Sacrilege or Impiety to slight the Company of so Divine _a Guest,_ and in a manner banish him our Breast, by refusing to enter with him into those secret Conferences, by which alone he cou'd be enabled to become our _Adviser_ and _Guide._ But I shou'd esteem it unfair to proceed upon such an Hypothesis as this: when the very utmost the wise Antients ever meant by this _Daemon_-Companion, I conceive to have been no more than enigmatically to declare, \"That we had each of us a Patient in _our-self;_ that we were properly our own Subjects of Practice; and that we then became due Practitioners, when by virtue of an intimate _Recess_ we cou'd discover a certain _Duplicity_ of Soul, and divide our-selves into _two Partys._\" One of these, as they suppos'd, wou'd immediately approve himself a venerable _Sage;_ and with an air of Authority erect himself our Counsellor and Governor; whilst the other Party, who had nothing in him besides what was base and _servile,_ wou'd be contented to follow and obey.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"According therefore as this _Recess_ was deep and intimate, and the _Dual_ Number practically form'd in Us, we were suppos'd to advance in Morals and true Wisdom.

Such Confidence they had in this Home-_Dialect_ of ^Soliloquy.^ For it was accounted the peculiar of Philosophers and wise Men, to be able _to hold themselves in Talk._ And it was their Boast on this account, \"That they were never less _alone,_ than when _by themselves._\" A Knave, they thought, cou'd never be _by himself._ Not that his Conscience was always sure of giving him disturbance; but he had not, they suppos'd, so much Interest with himself, as to exert this generous Faculty, and raise himself _a Companion;_ who being fairly admitted into Partnership, wou'd quickly mend his Partner, and set his Affairs on a right foot.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One wou'd think, there was nothing easier for us, than to know our own Minds, and understand what our main _Scope_ was; what we plainly drove at, and what we propos'd to our-selves, as our _End,_ in every Occurrence of our Lives.

Much less can he endure to carry on his Thought, as he necessarily must, if he enters once thorowly _into Himself,_ and proceeds by _Interrogatorys_ to form the Home-Acquaintance and Familiarity requir'd.

Why not? since 'tis _my Interest._ Shou'd I not be glad therefore to help this matter forwards, and promote _my Interest,_ if it lay fairly in my power? No doubt; provided I were sure not to be punish'd for it. And what reason has the greatest Rogue in Nature for not doing thus? The same reason, and no other. Am I not then, at the bottom, the same as he? The same: an arrant Villain; tho perhaps more a Coward, and not so perfect in my kind. If _Interest_ therefore points me out this Road; whither would _Humanity_ and _Compassion_ lead me? Quite contrary. Why therefore do I cherish such Weaknesses? Why do I sympathize with others? Why please myself in the Conceit of _Worth_ and _Honour? a Character, a Memory, an Issue,_ or _a Name?_ What else are these but Scruples in my way?

For so true a Reverence has every-one for himself, when he comes clearly to appear before his close Companion, that he had rather profess the vilest things of himself in open Company, than hear his Character privately from his own Mouth. So that we may readily from hence conclude, That the chief Interest of _Ambition, Avarice, Corruption,_ and every sly insinuating _Vice,_ is to prevent this Interview and Familiarity of Discourse which is consequent upon close Retirement and inward Recess. 'Tis the grand Artifice of _Villany_ and _Leudness,_ as well as of _Superstition_ and _Bigotry,_ to put us upon Terms of greater Distance and Formality with our-selves, and evade our proving Method of ^Soliloquy.^ And for this reason, how specious soever may be the Instruction and Doctrine of _Formalists;_ their very Manner it-self is a sufficient _Blind,_ or _Remora_ in the way of Honesty and good Sense.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am sensible, that shou'd my Reader be peradventure _a Lover,_ after the more profound and solemn way of Love, he wou'd be apt to conclude, that he was no Stranger to our propos'd Method of Practice; being conscious to himself of having often made vigorous Excursions into those solitary Regions above-mention'd; where _Soliloquy_ is upheld with most advantage. He may chance to remember how he has many times address'd the Woods and Rocks in audible articulate Sounds, and seemingly expostulated with himself in such a manner, as if he had really form'd the requisite _Distinction,_ and had the Power to entertain himself in due form. But it is very apparent, that tho all were true we have here suppos'd, it can no way reach the Case before us. For a passionate Lover, whatever Solitude he may affect, can never be truly _by him__self._ His Case is like the _Author's_ who has begun his Courtship to the Publick, and is embark'd in an Intrigue which sufficiently amuses, and takes him out of himself. Whatever he meditates alone, is interrupted still by the imagin'd Presence of the Mistress he pursues. Not a Thought, not an Expression, not a Sigh, which is purely for himself. All is appropriated, and all devoutly tender'd to the Object of his Passion.

He has the Specters of his Zeal before his Eyes; and is as familiar with his Modes, Essences, Personages, and Exhibitions of ^Deity,^ as the _Conjurer_ with his different Forms, Species, and Orders of ^Genii^ or ^Daemons.^ So that we make no doubt to assert, that not so much as a recluse Religionist, a Votary, or _Hermit,_ was ever truly _by himself._ And thus since neither _Lover, Author, Mystick,_ or _Conjurer,_ (who are the only Claimants) can truly or justly be entitled to a Share in this Self-entertainment; it remains that the only Person intitled, is the _Man of Sense,_ the _Sage,_ or _Philosopher._ However, since of all other Characters we are generally the most inclin'd to favour that of _a Lover;_ it may not, we hope, be impertinent, on this occasion, to recite the Story of an Amour.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A VIRTUOUS young Prince of a heroick Soul, capable of Love and Friendship, made war upon a Tyrant, who was in every respect his Reverse.

Already he had won over to his Party several Potentates and Princes, who before had been subject to the Tyrant. Among those who adher'd still to the Enemy, there was a Prince, who having all the advantage of Person and Merit, had lately been made happy in the Possession and mutual Love of the most beautiful Princess in the world. It happen'd that the Occasions of the War call'd the new-marry'd Prince to a distance from his belov'd Princess. He left her secure, as he thought, in a strong Castle, far within the Country: but in his absence the Place was taken by surprize, and the Princess brought a Captive to the Quarters of our heroick Prince.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.2.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There was in the Camp a young Nobleman, Favourite of the Prince; one who had been educated with him, and was still treated by him with perfect Familiarity.

'Twas the same young Lord, who had discover'd her disguis'd among the Prisoners, and learnt her Story; the particulars of which he now related to the Prince. He spoke in extasy on this occasion; telling the Prince how beautiful she appear'd, even in the midst of Sorrow; and tho disguis'd under the meanest Habit, yet how distinguishable, by her Air and Manner, from every other Beauty of her Sex. But what appear'd strange to our young Nobleman, was, that the Prince, during this whole relation, discover'd not the least Intention of seeing the Lady, or satisfying that Curiosity, which seem'd so natural on such an occasion.

But that imaginary one of Beauty hurts only those who are consenting. It affects no otherwise, than as we ourselves are pleas'd to allow it. In many Cases we absolutely command it: as where Relation and Consanguinity are in the nearest degree. Authority and Law, we see, can master it.
