For the chief Nerve and Sinew of this Style consists in the clear Division and Partition of the Subjects. Tho there is nothing _exalting_ in the Manner, 'tis naturally powerful and _commanding;_ and, more than any other, subdues the Mind, and strengthens its Determinations. 'Tis from this Genius that firm Conclusions and steddy _Maxims_ are best form'd: which, if solidly built, and on sure ground, are the shortest and best Guides towards Wisdom and Ability, in every kind; but if defective, or unsound, in the least part, must of necessity lead us to the grossest Absurditys, and stiffest Pedantry and Conceit.","subId":"36","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.2.36"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now tho every other Style and genuine Manner of Composition has its Order and Method, as well as this which, in a peculiar sense, we call _the Methodick;_ yet it is this Manner alone which professes Method, dissects it-self in Parts, and makes its own Anatomy. _The Sublime_ can no way condescend thus, or bear to be suspended in its impetuous Course. _The Comick,_ or derisory Manner, is further still from making shew of Method. 'Tis then, if ever, that it presumes to give it-self this wise Air, when its Design is to expose the Thing it-self, and ridicule the Formality and Sophistry so often shelter'd beneath it. _The Simple_ Manner, which being the strictest Imitation of Nature, shou'd of right be the completest, in the Distribution of its Parts, and Symmetry of its Whole, is yet so far from making any ostentation of Method, that it conceals the Artifice as much as possible: endeavouring only to express the effect of Art, under the appearance of the greatest Ease and Negligence.

The Way of _Form_ and ^Method,^ the _didactive_ or _preceptive_ Manner, as it has been usually practis'd amongst us, and as our Ears have been long accustom'd, has so little force towards the winning our Attention, that it is apter to tire us, than the Metre of an old Ballad.

The only Manner left, in which Criticism can have its just Force amongst us, is the _antient_ ^Comick;^ of which kind were the first _Roman_ Miscellanys, or _Satirick_ Pieces: a sort of original Writing of their own, refin'd afterwards by the best Genius, and politest Poet of that Nation; who, notwithstanding, owns the Manner to have been taken from the _Greek_ Comedy above-mention'd.
