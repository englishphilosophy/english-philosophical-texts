Whoever has heard any thing of the Lives of famous _Statuarys, Architects,_ or _Painters,_ will call to mind many Instances of this nature.

For is there not a _Workmanship_ and _a Truth_ in ^Actions?^ Or is _the Workmanship_ of this kind less becoming, or less worthy our notice; that we shou'd not in this case be as surly at least as the honest _Artizan,_ who has no other _Philosophy,_ than what _Nature_ and his _Trade_ have taught him?","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When one considers this Zeal and Honesty of inferiour Artists, one wou'd wonder to see those who pretend to Skill and Science in a higher kind, have so little regard to _Truth,_ and _the Perfection of their Art._ One wou'd expect it of our _Writers,_ that if they had real Ability, they shou'd draw _the_ ^World^ to _them;_ and not meanly sute _themselves_ to _the_ ^World,^ in its weak State. We may justly indeed make allowances for the Simplicity of those early _Genius's_ of our Nation, who after so many barbarous Ages, when Letters lay yet in their Ruins, made bold Excursions into a vacant Field, to seize the Posts of Honour, and attain the Stations which were yet unpossess'd by the Wits of their own Country. But since the Age is now so far advanc'd; Learning establish'd; the Rules of Writing stated; and the Truth of Art so well apprehended, and every where confess'd and own'd: 'tis strange to see our _Writers_ as unshapen still and monstrous in their Works, as heretofore. There can be nothing more ridiculous than to hear our ^Poets,^ in their _Prefaces,_ talk of Art and Structure; whilst in their _Pieces_ they perform as ill as ever, and with as little regard to those profess'd _Rules of Art,_ as the honest ^Bards,^ their Predecessors, who had never heard of any such _Rules,_ or at least had never own'd their Justice or Validity.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Had the early Poets of ^Greece^ thus complimented their Nation, by complying with its first Relish and Appetite; they had not done their Countrymen such Service, nor themselves such Honour as we find they did, by conforming to Truth and Nature. The generous Spirits who first essay'd the Way, had not always _the_ ^World^ on their side: but soon drew after 'em _the best Judgments;_ and soon afterwards the ^World^ it-self. They forc'd their way into it, and by weight of Merit turn'd its Judgment on their side. They form'd their Audience; polish'd the Age; refin'd the publick Ear, and fram'd it right; that in return they might be rightly and lastingly applauded. Nor were they disappointed in their Hope. The Applause soon came, and was lasting; for it was found. They have Justice done them at this day. They have surviv'd their Nation; and live, tho in a dead Language. The more the Age is enlighten'd, the more they shine. Their Fame must necessarily last as long as Letters; and Posterity will ever own their Merit.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Our modern Authors, on the contrary, are turn'd and model'd (as themselves confess) by the publick Relish, and current Humour of the Times.

In our Days _the Audience_ makes _the Poet;_ and _the Bookseller the Author:_ with what Profit to _the Publick,_ or what Prospect of lasting Fame and Honour to _the Writer,_ let any one who has Judgment imagine.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But tho our _Writers_ charge their Faults thus freely on _the_ ^Publick;^ it will, I doubt, appear from many Instances, that this Practice is mere Imposture: since those Absurditys, which they are aptest to commit, are far from being delightful or entertaining. We are glad to take up with what our Language can afford us; and by a sort of _Emulation_ with other Nations, are forc'd to cry up such Writers of our own, as may best serve us for Comparison. But when we are out of this Spirit, it must be own'd, we are not apt to discover any great Fondness or Admiration of our Authors. Nor have we any, whom by mutual Consent we make to be our _Standard._ We go to _Plays,_ or to other _Shows;_ and frequent the Theater, as the Booth. We read _Epicks_ and _Dramaticks,_ as we do _Satirs_ and _Lampoons._ For we must of necessity know what _Wit_ as well as what _Scandal_ is stirring. Read we must; let Writers be ever so indifferent. And this perhaps may be some occasion of the Laziness and Negligence of our Authors; who observing this Need, which our Curiosity brings on us, and making an exact Calculation in the way of Trade, to know justly the Quality and Quantity of the publick Demand, feed us thus from hand to mouth; resolving not to over-stock the Market, or be at the pains of more Correctness or Wit than is absolutely necessary to carry on the Traffick.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Our Satir therefore is scurrilous, buffooning, and without Morals or Instruction, which is the Majesty and Life of this kind of writing. Our ^Encomium^ or ^Panegyrick^ is as fulsom and displeasing, by its prostitute and abandon'd manner of Praise. The worthy Persons who are the Subjects of it, may well be esteem'd Sufferers by the Manner. And the Publick, whether it will or no, is forc'd to make untoward Reflections, when led to it by such _satirizing Panegyrists._ For in reality the Nerve and Sinew of modern _Panegyrick_ lies in a dull kind of _Satir;_ which the Author, it's true, intends shou'd turn to the advantage of his Subject; but which, if I mistake not, will appear to have a very contrary Effect.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The usual Method, which our _Authors_ take, when they wou'd commend either a _Brother-Author,_ a _Wit,_ a _Hero,_ a _Philosopher,_ or a _Statesman,_ is to look abroad, to find within the narrow compass of their Learning, some eminent Names of Persons, who answer'd to these Characters in a former time. These they are sure to lash, as they imagine, with some sharp stroke of _Satir._ And when they have stripp'd these reverend Personages of all their share of Merit, they think to clothe their Hero with the Spoils. Such is the Sterility of these _Encomiasts!_ They know not how to praise, but by Detraction. If a Fair-One is to be celebrated, ^Helen^ must in comparison be deform'd; ^Venus^ her-self degraded. That _a Modern_ may be honour'd, some _Antient_ must be sacrific'd. If _a Poet_ is to be extol'd; down with a ^Homer^ or a ^Pindar.^ If an _Orator,_ or _Philosopher;_ down with ^Demosthenes,Tully,Plato.^ If _a General of our Army;_ down with any _Hero_ whatever of Time past. \"The _Romans_ knew no Discipline!

I wou'd willingly however advise these _Celebrators_ to be a little more moderate in the use of this _Club_-method. Not that I pretend to ask quarter for _the Antients._ But for the sake merely of those _Moderns,_ whom our Panegyrists undertake to praise, I wou'd wish 'em to be a little cautious of comparing Characters. There is no need to call up a ^Publicola,^ or a ^Scipio,^ an ^Aristides,^ or a ^Cato,^ to serve as Foils. These were Patriots and good Generals in their time, and did their Country honest service. No offence to any who at present do the same. The ^Fabricius's,^ the ^AEmilius's,^ the ^Cincinnatus'^ s (poor Men!) may be suffer'd to rest quietly: or if their Ghosts shou'd, by this unlucky kind of Inchantment, be rais'd in Mockery and Contempt; they may perhaps prove troublesom in earnest, and cast such Reflections on our _Panegyrists,_ and their _modern Patrons,_ as may be no-way for the advantage of either. The well-deserving Antients will have always a strong Party among the Wise and Learned of every Age. And the Memory of foreign Worthys, as well as those of our own Nation, will with gratitude be cherish'd by the nobler Spirits of Mankind. The Interest of _the Dead_ is not so disregarded, but that in case of violence offer'd 'em, thro' partiality to _the Living,_ there are Hands ready prepar'd to make sufficient Reprisals.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Twas in times when Flattery grew much in fashion, that the Title of _Panegyrick_ was appropriated to such Pieces as contain'd only a profuse and unlimited Praise of some single Person.

Their _Trials of Skill,_ it's true, are wholly of _the Body,_ not of _the Brain._ Nor is it to be wonder'd at, if being left to themselves, and no way assisted by the Laws or Magistrate, their bodily Exercises retain something of the _Barbarian_ Character, or, at least, shew their[n1] Manners to hold more of[n2] ^Rome^ than ^Greece.^ The _Gladiatorian,_ and other sanguinary Sports, which we allow our People, discover sufficiently our National Taste.

I know not how they can answer it to the Fair Sex, to speak (as they pretend) _experimentally,_ and with such nice distinction of their Audience. How far this Excuse may serve 'em in relation to _common Amours_ and _Love-Adventures,_ I will not take upon me to pronounce.

The same pretended Judges, had they flourish'd in our ^Britain^ at the time when ^Caesar^ made his first Descent, wou'd have condemn'd, as a _whimsical Critick,_ the Man who shou'd have made bold to censure our deficiency of Clothing, and laugh at the blue Cheeks and party-colour'd Skins which were then in fashion with our Ancestors. Such must of necessity be the Judgment of those who are only _Criticks by fashion._ But to a just _Naturalist_ or _Humanist,_ who knows the Creature ^Man,^ and judges of his Growth and Improvement in Society, it appears evidently that we _British_ Men were as barbarous and unciviliz'd in respect of the _Romans_ under a ^Caesar,^ as the _Romans_ themselves were in respect of the _Grecians,_ when they invaded that Nation under a ^Mummius.^","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The noble Wits of a Court-Education, who can go no farther back into Antiquity than their Pedegree will carry 'em, are able however to call to mind the different State of Manners in some few Reigns past, when _Chivalry_ was in such repute. The Ladys were then Spectators not only of feign'd Combats and martial Exercises, but of real Duels and bloody Feats of Arms. They sat as Umpires and Judges of the doughty Frays. These were the Saint-Protectrices, to whom the Champions chiefly paid their Vows, and to whom they recommended themselves by these galante Quarrels, and elegant Decisions of Right and Justice. Nor is this Spirit so entirely lost amongst us, but that even at this hour the Fair Sex inspire us still with the Fancy of like Gallantrys. They are the chief Subject of many such civil Turmoils, and remain still the secret influencing Constellation by which we are engag'd to give and ask that _Satisfaction,_ which is peculiar to the _fine Gentlemen_ of the Age. For thus a certain Galante of our Court express'd the Case very naturally, when being ask'd by his Friends, why one of his establish'd Character for Courage and good Sense, wou'd answer the Challenge of a Coxcomb; he confess'd, \"That for his _own_ Sex, he cou'd safely trust their Judgment: But how shou'd he appear at night before _the Maids of Honour?_\"","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Such is the different _Genius_ of Nations; and of the same Nation in different Times and Seasons.

Notwithstanding his natural Rudeness, his unpolish'd Style, his antiquated Phrase and Wit, his want of Method and Coherence, and his Deficiency in almost all the Graces and Ornaments of this kind of Writings; yet by the Justness of his ^Moral,^ the Aptness of many of his _Descriptions,_ and the plain and natural Turn of several of his _Characters,_ he pleases his Audience, and often gains their Ear, without a single Bribe from Luxury or Vice. That[n7] Piece of his, which appears to have most affected _English_ Hearts, and has perhaps been oftnest acted of any which have come upon our Stage, is almost one continu'd _Moral;_ a Series of deep Reflections, drawn from _one_ Mouth, upon the Subject of _one_ single Accident and Calamity, naturally fitted to move Horror and Compassion. It may be properly said of this Play, if I mistake not, that it has only ^One^ _Character_ or _principal Part._ It contains no Adoration or Flattery of _the Sex:_ no ranting at _the Gods:_ no blustring _Heroism:_ nor any thing of that curious mixture of _the Fierce_ and _Tender,_ which makes the hinge of modern Tragedy, and nicely varies it between the Points of _Love_ and _Honour._","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon the whole: since in the two great poetick Stations, the _Epick_ and _Dramatick,_ we may observe the moral Genius so naturally prevalent: since our[n8] most approv'd _heroick Poem_ has neither the Softness of Language, nor the fashionable Turn of Wit; but merely solid Thought, strong Reasoning, noble Passion, and a continu'd Thred of moral Doctrine, Piety, and Virtue to recommend it; we may justly infer, that it is not so much the _publick Ear,_ as the _ill Hand_ and _vitious Manner_ of our Poets, which need redress.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.3.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"AND thus, at last, we are return'd to our old Article of ^Advice;^ that main Preliminary of _Self-study_ and _inward Con__verse,_ which we have found so much wanting in the Authors of our Time.
