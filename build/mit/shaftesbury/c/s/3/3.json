He therefore takes the advantage of his _Corollary_ or _Winding-up;_ and ends pathetically, by endeavouring in the softest manner to reconcile his Reader to those Faults which he chuses rather to excuse than to amend.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"General Practice has made this a necessary Part of Elegance, hardly to be pass'd over by any Writer.

There appears such a peculiar Grace and Ingenuity in the method of confessing _Laziness, Precipitancy, Carelessness,_ or whatever other Vices have been the occasion of the Author's Deficiency; that it wou'd seem a Pity, had the Work it-self been brought to such Perfection, as to have left no room for the penitent Party to enlarge on his own _Demerits._ For from the multiplicity of these, he finds Subject to ingratiate himself with _his Reader;_ who doubtless is not a little rais'd by this Submission of _a confessing Author;_ and is ready, on these terms, to give him _Absolution,_ and receive him into his good Grace and Humour.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the galante World, indeed, we easily find how far a _Humility_ of this kind prevails.

For ^Merit^ is generally thought presumptuous, and suppos'd to carry with it a certain Assurance and Ease, with which a _Mistress_ is not so well contented. The Claim of well-deserving seems to derogate from the pure Grace and Favour of the _Benefactrice;_ who then appears to her-self most sovereign in Power, and likeliest to be obey'd without reserve, when she bestows her Bounty, where there is least Title, or Pretension.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus a certain Adoration of the Sex, which passes in our Age without the least Charge of Profaneness, or Idolatry, may, according to vulgar Imagination, serve to justify these _galante Votarys,_ in the imitation of the real _Religious_ and _Devout._ The method of[n1] Self-abasement may perhaps be thought the properest to make Approaches to the sacred Shrines: And the intire Resignation of _Merit,_ in each Case, may be esteem'd the only ground of well-deserving.

'Tis no wonder, if after so wrong a ground of Education, there appears to be such need of Redress, and Amendment, from that excellent School which we call _the World._ The mere Amusements of _Gentlemen_ are found more improving than the profound Researches of _Pedants._ And in the Management of our Youth, we are forc'd to have recourse to the former; as an Antidote against the Genius peculiar to the latter.

We are many of us, indeed, so grave as to continue this Exercise of Youth thro' our remaining Life. The exercising-Authors of this kind have been above[n10] describ'd, in the beginning of this Treatise. The Manner of Exercise is call'd _Meditation,_ and is of a sort so solemn and profound, that we dare not so much as thorowly examine the Subject on which we are bid to meditate. This is a sort of _Task_-Reading, in which a ^Taste^ is not permitted. How little soever we take of this Diet; 'tis sufficient to give full Exercise to our grave Humour, and allay the Appetite towards further Research and solid Contemplation. The rest is Holiday, Diversion, Play, and Fancy. We reject all _Rule;_ as thinking it an Injury to our Diversions, to have regard to _Truth_ or _Nature:_ without which, however, nothing can be truly agreeable, or entertaining; much less, instructive, or improving. Thro' a certain[n11] Surfeit taken in a wrong kind of _serious_ Reading, we apply our-selves, with full content, to the most _ridiculous._ The more remote our Pattern is from any thing moral or profitable; the more Freedom and Satisfaction we find in it.

Besides what I have observ'd in Conversation with the Men of this Character, I can produce many anathematiz'd Authors, who if they want a true _Israelitish_ Faith, can make amends by a _Chinese_ or _Indian_ one.

Letters are indeed banish'd, I know not where, in distant Cloisters and _unpractis'd Cells,_ as our Poet has it, confin'd to the Commerce and mean _Fellowship of bearded Boys._ The sprightly Arts and Sciences are sever'd from _Philosophy,_ which consequently must grow dronish, insipid, pedantick, useless, and directly opposite to the real Knowledg and Practice of the World and Mankind. Our Youth accordingly seem to have their only Chance between two widely different Roads; either that of _Pedantry_ and _School-Learning,_ which lies amidst the Dregs and most corrupt part of antient Literature; or that of the _fashionable illiterate World,_ which aims merely at the Character of _the fine Gentleman,_ and takes up with the Foppery of modern Languages and foreign Wit. The frightful Aspect of the former of these Roads makes the Journey appear desperate and impracticable. Hence that Aversion so generally conceiv'd against _a learned Character,_ wrong turn'd, and hideously set out, under such Difficultys, and in such seeming Labyrinths, and mysterious Forms.

Athenion of Maronea is compared with Nicias, but greatly preferred to him. He was a pupil of Glaucion the Corinthian, rather gloomy in colouring, yet pleasant in his gloom, so that his cultivation comes out in his very painting. . . . Had he not died young, no one could be compared with him. . . . Aristolaus, son and pupil of Pausias, was one of the most austere of painters. . . . Lately too we had Amulius, a severe and serious painter. . . . He used only to paint a few hours a day, but that very seriously, for he always wore full dress, even on his scaffolding.—Pliny, _H. N._ xxxv. (cc. 37, 40) 119–137.] One of the mortal Symptoms upon which ^Pliny^ pronounces the sure Death of this noble Art, not long survivor to him, was what belong'd in common to all the other perishing Arts after the Fall of Liberty; I mean _the Luxury_ of the ^Roman^ Court, and the Change of _Taste_ and _Manners_ naturally consequent to such a Change of Government and Dominion. This excellent, learned, and polite Critick represents to us the _false Taste_ springing from the Court it-self, and from that Opulence, Splendor, and Affectation of Magnificence and Expence proper to the Place. Thus in the Statuary and Architecture then in vogue, nothing cou'd be admir'd beside what was costly in the mere Matter or Substance of the Work. Precious Rock, rich Metal, glittering Stones, and other luscious Ware, poisonous to Art, came every day more into request; and were impos'd, as necessary Materials, on the best Masters. 'Twas in favour of these Court-Beautys and gaudy Appearances, that all good _Drawing,_ just _Design,_ and _Truth of Work_ began to be despis'd. Care was taken to procure from distant Parts, the most gorgeous splendid Colours, of the most costly Growth or Composition: not such as had been us'd by ^Apelles^ and the great Masters, who are justly severe, loyal, and faithful to their Art. This newer Colouring our Critick calls _the florid kind._ The Materials were too rich to be furnish'd by the Painter, but were bespoke or furnish'd at the cost of the Person who employ'd him; (_quos Dominus pingenti praestat._) The other he calls the _austere kind._ And thus, says he, \"_Rerum, non Animi pretiis excubatur:_ The _Cost,_ and not the _Life,_ and _Art,_ is study'd.\" He shews, on the contrary, what care ^Apelles^ took to subdue the _florid_ Colours, by a darkening Varnish; _ut eadem res,_ says he, _nimis floridis coloribus Austeritatem occultè daret._ And he says just before, of some of the finest Pieces of ^Apelles,^ \"That they were wrought in _four_ Colours only.\" So great and venerable was SIMPLICITY held among the Antients, and so certain was the Ruin of all true Elegance in Life or Art, where this Mistress was once quitted or contemn'd!
