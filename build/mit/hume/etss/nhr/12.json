But ^Herodotus^ judiciously ascribes this sally of passion to a real madness or disorder of the brain: Otherwise, says the historian, he never would have openly affronted any established worship.

There are even some pleasant stories of that kind, which, though somewhat profane, are commonly told by the Catholics themselves. One day, a priest, it is said, gave inadvertently, instead of the sacrament, a counter, which had by accident fallen among the holy wafers. The communicant waited patiently for some time, expecting it would dissolve on his tongue: But finding that it still remained entire, he took it off. _I wish,_ cried he to the priest, _you have not committed some mistake: I wish you have not given me God the Father: He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him._","subId":"3","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.3","pages":"67"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A famous general, at that time in the ^Muscovite^ service, having come to ^Paris^ for the recovery of his wounds, brought along with him a young ^Turk^, whom he had taken prisoner. Some of the doctors of the ^Sorbonne^ (who are altogether as positive as the dervises of ^Constantinople^) thinking |it a pity, that the poor ^Turk^ should be damned for want of instruction, solicited ^Mustapha^ very hard to turn Christian, and promised him, for his encouragement, plenty of good wine in this world, and paradise in the next. These allurements were too powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper. The priest, however, to make every thing sure and solid, still continued his instructions; and began the next day with the usual question, _How many Gods are there?_ _None at all,_ replies ^Benedict^; for that was his new name. _How! None at all!_ cries the priest. _To be sure,_ said the honest proselyte. _You have told me all along that there is but one God: And yesterday I eat him._","subId":"4","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.4","pages":"67-8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Such are the doctrines of our brethren the Catholics.

One day I observed his ^Moorish^ excellency diverting himself under the porch, with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along; when there chanced to pass that way some _Capucin_ friars, who had never seen a ^Turk^; as he, on his part, though accustomed to the ^European^ dresses, had never seen the grotesque figure of a _Capucin:_ And there is no expressing the mutual admiration, with which they inspired each other. Had the chaplain of the embassy entered into a dispute with these ^Franciscans^, their reciprocal surprize had been of the same nature. Thus all mankind stand staring at one another; and there is no beating it into their heads, that the turban of the ^African^ is not just as good or as bad a fashion as the cowl of the ^European^. _He is a very honest man,_ said the prince of ^Sallee^, speaking of de ^Ruyter^, _It is a pity he were a Christian._","subId":"6","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.6","pages":"68"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How can you worship leeks and onions? we shall suppose a ^Sorbonnist^ to say to a priest of ^Sais^.

They are at least as good as the relics or rotten bones of martyrs, answers his no less learned antagonist. Are you not mad, insists the Catholic, to cut one another's throat about the preference of a |cabbage or a cucumber? Yes, says the pagan; I allow it, if you will confess, that those are still madder, who fight about the preference among volumes of sophistry, ten thousand of which are not equal in value to one cabbage or cucumber[n58].","subId":"7","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.7","pages":"68-9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Every by-stander will easily judge (but unfortunately the by-standers are few) that, if nothing were requisite to establish any popular system, but exposing the absurdities of other systems, every votary of every superstition could give a sufficient reason for his blind and bigotted attachment to the principles in which he has been educated. But without so extensive a knowledge, on which to ground this assurance (and perhaps, better without it), there is not wanting a sufficient stock of religious zeal and faith among mankind. ^Diodorus Siculus^[n59] gives a remarkable instance to this purpose, of which he was himself an eye-witness. While ^Egypt^ lay under the greatest terror of the ^Roman^ name, a legionary soldier having inadvertently been guilty of the sacrilegious impiety of killing a cat, the whole people rose upon him with the utmost fury; and all the efforts of the prince were not able to save him. The senate and people of ^Rome^, I am persuaded, would not, then, have been so delicate with regard to their national deities. They very frankly, a little after that time, voted ^Augustus^ a place in the celestial mansions; and would have dethroned every god in heaven, for his sake, had he seemed to desire it. _Presens divus habebitur ^Augustus^,_ says ^Horace^. That is a very important point: And in other nations and other ages, the same circumstance has not been deemed altogether indifferent[n60].","subId":"8","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.8","pages":"69"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Notwithstanding the sanctity of our holy religion, says ^Tully^[n61], no crime is more common with us than sacrilege: But was it ever heard of, that an ^Egyptian^ violated the temple of a cat, an ibis, or a crocodile? There is no torture, an ^Egyptian^ would not undergo, says the same author in another place[n62], rather than injure an ibis, an aspic, a cat, a dog, or a crocodile. Thus it is strictly true, what ^Dryden^ observes, \"\"\"Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be, // Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree, // In his defence his servants are as bold, // As if he had been born of beaten gold.\" // ~~~~~~^Absolom^ and ^Achitophel.^\"\" Nay, the baser the materials are, of which the divinity is composed, the greater devotion is he likely to excite in the breasts of his deluded votaries. They exult in their shame, and make a merit with their deity, in braving, for his sake, all the ridicule and contumely of his enemies. Ten thousand Crusaders inlist themselves under the holy banners; and even openly triumph in those parts of their religion, which their adversaries regard as the most reproachful.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.9","pages":"70"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There occurs, I own, a difficulty in the ^Egyptian^ system of theology; as indeed, few systems of that kind are entirely free from difficulties. It is evident, from their method of propagation, that a couple of cats, in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom; and if that religious veneration were still paid them, it would, in twenty more, not only be easier in ^Egypt^ to find a god than a man, which ^Petronius^ says was the case in some parts of ^Italy^; but the gods must at last entirely starve the men, and leave themselves neither priests nor votaries remaining. It is probable, therefore, that this wise nation, the most celebrated in antiquity for prudence and sound policy, foreseeing such dangerous consequences, reserved all their worship for the full-grown divinities, and used the freedom to drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods, without any scruple or remorse. And thus the practice of warping the tenets of religion, in order to serve temporal interests, is not, by any means, to be regarded as an invention of these later ages.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.10","pages":"70"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The learned, philosophical ^Varro^, discoursing of religion, pretends not to deliver any thing beyond probabilities and appearances: Such was his good sense and moderation!

But it appears, that, whatever sceptical liberties that great man might take, in his writings or in philosophical conversation; he yet avoided, in the common conduct of life, the imputation of deism and profaneness. Even in his own family, and to his wife ^Terentia^, whom he highly trusted, he was willing to appear a devout religionist; and there remains a letter, addressed to her, in which he seriously desires her to offer sacrifice to ^Apollo^ and ^{AE}sculapius^, in gratitude for the recovery of his health[n66].","subId":"13","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.13","pages":"71"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Pompey^'s devotion was much more sincere: In all his conduct, during the civil wars, he paid a great regard to auguries, dreams, and prophesies[n67]. ^Augustus^ was tainted with superstition of every kind.

That great and able emperor was also extremely uneasy, when he happened to change his shoes, and put the right foot shoe on the left foot[n68]. In short it cannot be doubted, but the votaries of the established superstition of antiquity were as numerous in every state, as those of the modern religion are at present. Its influence was as universal; though it was not so great.

Men dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts which they entertain on such |subjects: They make a merit of implicit faith; and disguise to themselves their real infidelity, by the strongest asseverations and most positive bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and suffers not the obscure, glimmering light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the strong impressions, made by common sense and by experience. The usual course of men's conduct belies their words, and shows, that their assent in these matters is some unaccountable operation of the mind between disbelief and conviction, but approaching much nearer to the former than to the latter.","subId":"15","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.15","pages":"71-2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Since, therefore, the mind of man appears of so loose and unsteady a texture, that, even at present, when so many persons find an interest in continually employing on it the chissel and the hammer, yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets with any lasting impression; how much more must this have been the case in ancient times, when the retainers to the holy function were so much fewer in comparison?

The stories of the gods were numberless like the popish legends; and though every one, almost, believed a part of these stories, yet no one could believe or know the whole: While, at the same time, all must have acknowledged, that no one part stood on a better foundation than the rest. The traditions of different cities and nations were also, on many occasions, directly opposite; and no reason could be assigned for preferring one to the other. And as there was an infinite number of stories, with regard to which tradition was nowise positive; the gradation was insensible, from the most fundamental articles of faith, to those loose and precarious fictions. The pagan religion, therefore, seemed to vanish like a cloud, whenever one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal. It could never be ascertained by any fixed dogmas and principles. And though this did not convert the generality of mankind from so absurd a faith; for when will the people be reasonable? yet it made them faulter and hesitate more in maintaining their principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain dispositions of mind, |some practices and opinions, which had the appearance of determined infidelity.","subId":"17","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.17","pages":"72-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To which we may add, that the fables of the pagan religion were, of themselves, light, easy, and familiar; without devils, or seas of brimstone, or any object that could much terrify the imagination.

In this respect, it was a true poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry.

I know not, but a contrary inference may be more probable. The less importunate and assuming any species of superstition appears, the less will it provoke men's spleen and indignation, or engage them into enquiries concerning its foundation and origin. This in the mean time is obvious, that the empire of all religious faith over the understanding is wavering and uncertain, subject to every variety of humour, and dependent on the present incidents, which strike the imagination.

Lib. vii. p. 425. The same philosopher, proposing a project of mines for the encrease of the ^Athenian^ revenues, advises them first to consult the oracle. De rat. red. p. 392. That all this devotion was not a farce, in order to serve a political purpose, appears both from the facts themselves, and from the genius of that age, when little or nothing could be gained by hypocrisy. Besides, ^Xenophon^, as appears from his Memorabilia, was a kind of heretic in those times, which no political devotee ever is. It is for the same reason, I maintain, that ^Newton^, ^Locke^, ^Clarke^, &c. being _Arians_ or _Socinians_, were very sincere in the creed they professed: And I always oppose this argument to some libertines, who will needs have it, that it was impossible but that these philosophers must have been hypocrites.","subId":"n78.1","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.n78.1","pages":"74-5"},{"type":"note","content":"Pro ^Cluentio^, cap. 61.","subId":"n79","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.n79","pages":"75"},{"type":"note","content":"De bello ^Catilin^.","subId":"n80","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.12.n80","pages":"75"},{"type":"note","content":"^Cicero^ (Tusc.

Why then does ^Lucretius^ so highly exalt his master for freeing us from these terrors? Perhaps the generality of mankind were then in the disposition of ^Cephalus^ in ^Plato^ (de Rep. lib. i.) who while he was young and healthful could ridicule these stories; but as soon as he became old and infirm, began to entertain apprehensions of their truth.
