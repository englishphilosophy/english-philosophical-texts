But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind, and to have been, many of them, advanced from that inferior rank, we are more at our ease in our addresses to them, and may even, without profaneness, aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them. Hence activity, spirit, courage, magnanimity, love of liberty, and all the virtues which aggrandize a people.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.10.2","pages":"63"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The heroes in paganism correspond exactly to the saints in popery and holy dervises in ^Mahometanism^. The place of ^Hercules^, ^Theseus^, ^Hector^, ^Romulus^, is now supplied by ^Dominic^, ^Francis^, ^Anthony^, and ^Benedict^. Instead of the destruction of monsters, the subduing of tyrants, the defence of our native country; whippings and fastings, cowardice and humility, abject submission and slavish obedience, are become the means of obtaining celestial honours among mankind.","subId":"3","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.10.3","pages":"63"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One great incitement to the pious ^Alexander^ in his warlike expeditions was his rivalship of ^Hercules^ and ^Bacchus^, whom he justly pretended to have excelled[n53]. ^Brasidas^, that generous and noble ^Spartan^, after falling in battle, had heroic honours paid him by the inhabitants of ^Amphipolis^, whose defence he had embraced[n54].
