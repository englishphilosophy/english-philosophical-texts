All the World conspires to oppose and contradict me; tho' such is my Weakness, that I feel all my Opinions loosen and fall of themselves, when unsupported by the Approbation of #460.# others.— Can I be sure, that, in leaving all established Opinions, I am following Truth? and by what Criterion shall I distinguish her, even if _Fortune_ should at last guide me on her Footsteps? After the most accurate and exact of my Reasonings, I can give no Reason why I should assent to it; and feel nothing but a strong Propensity to consider Objects strongly in that View under which they #461.# appear to me.— The Memory, Senses, and Understanding, are all of them founded on the _Imagination_.— No Wonder a Principle so inconstant and fallacious should lead us into Errors, when implicitely followed (as it must be) in all its #464.# Variations.— I have already shown, that the Understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general Principles, _entirely_ subverts itself, and leaves not the _lowest Degree_ |of Evidence in any Proposition either in Philosophy or #465.# common Life.— We have no Choice left, #466.# but betwixt a _false Reason_ and _none at #467.# all_.— Where am I, or what? From what Causes do I derive my Existence, and to what Condition shall I return? Whose Favour shall I court, and whose Anger must I dread? What Beings surround me? On whom have I any Influence, or who have any Influence on me? I am confounded with all these Questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable Condition imaginable, invironed with the deepest Darkness, and utterly deprived of the Use of every Member #468.# and Faculty.— If I must be _a Fool_, as all those who reason or believe any Thing certainly are, my Follies shall at least be #469.# natural and agreeable.— In all the Incidents of Life, we ought still to preserve our Scepticism: If we believe that _Fire warms_, or _Water refreshes_, 'tis only because it costs us _too much Pains_ to think otherwise; nay, if we are Philosophers, _it ought only_ to be upon sceptical Principles. #470.# — I cannot forbear having a Curiosity to be acquainted with the Principles of moral Good and Evil, _&c_. I am concerned for the Condition of the _learned World_, which lies under such a deplorable Ignorance in all these Particulars. I feel an Ambition arise in me of contributing to the Instruction of Mankind, and of acquiring _a Name by my Inventions and Discoveries_.— Should I endeavour to banish these Sentiments, I feel I should be a Loser in point of Pleasure; and this is the Origin of my Philosophy.\"","subId":"6","id":"Hume.LG.6","pages":"420-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Agreeable to this summary View, he tells us, _p._ 123. \"Let us fix our Attention _out of ourselves_ as much as possible.— We really never advance a Step _beyond ourselves_; nor can conceive any Kind of Existence, but these Perceptions which have appeared in that narrow Compass: This is the Universe of the Imagination, nor have we any Idea but what is there produced.\"— Accordingly, \"An Opinion or Belief may be most accurately #172.# defined, _A lively Idea related or associated #321.# with a present Impression_; and is more properly an Act of the sensitive than of the cogitive Part of our Natures.\" And, #363.# \"Belief in general consists in nothing but #122.# the Vivacity of an Idea. Again, the Idea of _Existence_ is the very same with the Idea of what we conceive to be existent. — Any Idea we please to form is the Idea of a Being; and the Idea of a Being is any Idea we please to form. And as to the Notion of an external Existence, when taken for something specifically different from our Perceptions, we have shown its #330.# Absurdity: And what we call a Mind is nothing but a Heap or Collection of different Perceptions united together by certain Relations, and supposed, tho' falsly, #361.# to be endowed with a perfect Simplicity.\" #370.# And, \"The only Existence, of which we are certain, are Perceptions. #438.# When I enter most intimately into what I call _myself_, I always stumble on some particular Perception or other.— I never can catch _myself_ at any Time without a Perception, and never can observe _any #439.# Thing but the Perception_.— If any one think he has a different Notion of himself, I must confess I can reason no longer with him.— I may venture to affirm of the rest of Mankind, that they are nothing but a Bundle of Perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable Rapidity, and are in a perpetual Flux and Movement.\"— And lest the Reader should forget to apply all this to the Supreme Mind, and the Existence of the First Cause, he has a long Disquisition |concerning _Causes_ and _Effects_, the Sum of #321.# which amounts to this, That all our Reasonings #138.# concerning Causes and Effects are derived from _nothing_ but _Custom_: That, \"if any pretend to define a Cause by saying it is something productive of another, 'tis evident he would say nothing; for #298.# what does he mean by Production? That we may define a Cause to be _an Object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the Objects resembling the former are placed in like Relations of Precedency and Contiguity to these Objects that resemble the latter_; or, a _Cause is an Object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the Idea of the one determines the Mind to form the Idea of the other, and the Impression of the one to form a more lively Idea of the other_.\" From these clear and plain Definitions he infers, \"That all Causes are of the same Kind; and there is no Foundation for the Distinction betwixt efficient Causes, and Causes _sine qua non_; or betwixt _efficient_ Causes, and formal and material, and exemplary, #300.# and final Causes: And that there is but one Kind of Necessity, and #301.# the common Distinction betwixt Moral and Physical is without any Foundation in Nature: And that the Distinction we often make betwixt Power, and the Exercise of it, is equally without Foundation: And that the Necessity of a Cause to every Beginning of Existence, is not founded on any Arguments demonstrative or intuitive: And in fine, That _any Thing_ may produce _any Thing_; Creation, Annihilation, Motion, Reason, Volition; all these may arise from one another, or from any other Object we can imagine.\" This curious _Nostrum_ he often repeats, #284.# _p._ 430, 434. Again he tells us, \"That when we talk of any Being, whether of a Superior or Inferior Nature, as endowed with a Power or Force proportioned to any Effect,— We have really no distinct Meaning, and make Use only of common Words, without any clear and #294.# determinate Ideas. And if we have really no Idea of Power or Efficacy in any Object, or of any real Connection betwixt Causes and Effects, 'twill be to little Purpose to prove that an Efficacy is necessary in all Operations. We do not understand our own Meaning in talking so, but ignorantly confound Ideas which are intirely distinct from each #291.# other.\" Again he says, \"The Efficacy or Energy of Causes is neither placed in the Causes themselves, nor in the Deity, nor in the Concurrence of these two Principles, but belongs entirely to the Soul (_or the Bundle of Perceptions_) which considers the Union of two or more Objects in all past Instances: 'Tis here that the real Power of Causes is placed, along with their Connection and Necessity. And in fine, we may observe a Conjunction or a Relation of Cause _and Effect between different Perceptions_, but can never observe it between Perceptions and Objects.\" 'Tis impossible therefore, that, from the Existence or any of the Qualities of the former, we can ever form any Conclusion concerning the Existence of the latter, or ever satisfy our Reason in this Particular with regard to the Existence of a Supreme Being. 'Tis well known that this Principle, _Whatever begins to exist must have a Cause of Existence_, is the first Step in the Argument for the Being of a Supreme Cause; and that, without it, 'tis impossible to go one Step further in that Argument. Now this Maxim he is at great Pains from _p._ 141. to explode, and to show, \"That it is neither intuitively nor demonstratively certain;\" and he says, \"Reason can never satisfy us that the Existence of any |Object does ever imply that of #173.# another. So that, when we pass from the Impression of one to the Idea and Belief of another, we are not determined #172.# by Reason, but by Custom.\" In a marginal Note on the preceeding Page he says, \"In that Proposition, _God is_, or indeed any other which regards Existence, the Idea of Existence is no distinct Idea which we unite with that of the Object, and which is capable of forming a compound Idea by the Union.\" Concerning #280.# this Principle, _That the Deity is the prime Mover of the Universe, who first created Matter, and gave its original Impulse, and likewise supports its Existence, and successively bestows on it its Motions_; he says, \"This Opinion is certainly very curious, but it will appear superfluous to examine it in this Place.— For, if the very Idea be derived from an Impression, the Idea of a Deity proceeds from the same Origin; and, if no Impression implies any Force or Efficacy, 'tis equally impossible to discover, or even imagine, any such active Principle in the Deity.— Since Philosophers therefore have concluded, that Matter cannot be endowed with any efficacious Principle, because it is impossible to discover in it such a Principle; the same Course of Reasoning should determine them to exclude it from the Supreme Being: Or if they esteem that Opinion absurd and impious, as it really is, I shall tell them how they may avoid it, and that is, by _concluding from the very first_, that they have no adequate Idea of Power or Efficacy in any Object; since neither in Body nor Spirit, neither in Superior nor Inferior Natures, are they able to discover one single Instance of it.\" And #432.# says he, \"We have no Idea of a Being endowed with any Power, much less of one endowed with infinite Power.\"","subId":"7","id":"Hume.LG.7","pages":"421-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Concerning _the Immateriality of the Soul_ (from which the Argument is taken for its natural Immortality, or that it cannot perish by Dissolution as the Body) he #431.# says, \"We certainly may conclude that Motion may be and actually is the Cause of #434.# Thought and Perception: And no wonder, for any Thing may be the Cause or Effect of _any Thing_; which evidently gives the Advantage to the Materialists #418.# above their Adversaries.\" But yet more plainly, \"I assert, says he, that the Doctrine of the Immateriality, Simplicity, and Indivisibility of a thinking Substance, _is a true Atheism_, and will serve to justify _all_ these Sentiments for which _Spinoza_ #419.# is so universally infamous.\" This hideous Hypothesis is almost the same with that of the Immateriality of the Soul, which has #423.# become so popular. And again he endeavours to prove, that all the Absurdities which have been found in the Systems of _Spinoza_, may likewise be discovered in that #425.# of the Theologians: And concludes, that \"We cannot advance one Step towards the establishing the Simplicity and Immateriality of the Soul, without preparing the Way for a dangerous and irrecoverable Atheism.\"","subId":"8","id":"Hume.LG.8","pages":"423"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Author's Sentiments in Morality we have in Vol. 3. printed for _T.

That Justice is not a natural, but an artificial Virtue; and gives one pretty odd #128.# Reason for it: \"We may conclude, that the Laws of Justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be derived #101.# from Nature. I suppose (says he) a Person to have lent me a Sum of Money, on Condition that it be restored in a few Days; and also suppose, that, after Expiration of the Term agreed on, he demands the Sum: I ask, _What Reason or #43.# Motive have I to restore the Money?_ Publick Interest is not naturally attach'd to the Observation of the Rules of Justice, but #48.# is only connected with it, after an artificial Convention, for the Establishment of these Rules. Unless we will allow that Nature has established a _Sophistry_, and rendered it necessary and unavoidable; we must allow that the Sense of Justice and Injustice is not derived from Nature, but arises artificially, tho' necessarily, #69.# from Education and human Conventions. Here is a Proposition which I think may be regarded as certain, _That it is only from the Selfishness and confined Generosity of Men, along with the scanty Provision Nature has made for his Wants, that Justice derives its Origin_. These Impressions, which give Rise to this Sense of Justice, are not natural to the Mind of Man, but arise from Artifice #734.# and human Conventions. Without such a Convention, no one would ever have dreamed that there was such a Virtue as Justice, or have been induced to conform his Actions to it. Taking any single Act, my Justice may be pernicious in every Respect: And 'tis only upon the Supposition that others are to imitate my Example, that I can be induced to embrace that Virtue; since nothing but the Combination can render Justice advantageous, or afford me any Motive to conform myself to its Rules. #44.# And in general it may be affirmed, that there is no such Passion in human Minds, _as the Love of Mankind_ merely as such, independent of personal Qualities, of Service or of Relation to ourself.\"","subId":"10","id":"Hume.LG.10","pages":"424"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Mr. _Hobbs_, who was at Pains to shake loose all other natural Obligations, yet found it necessary to leave, or pretended to leave, the Obligation of Promises or Pactions; but our Author strikes a bolder Stroke: #101.# \"That the Rule of Morality (says he) which enjoins the Performance of _Promises_, is not natural, will sufficiently appear from these two Propositions, which I proceed to prove, _viz.

In Reality, a Philosopher who affects to doubt of the Maxims of _common Reason_, and even of his _Senses_, declares sufficiently that he is not in earnest, and that he intends not to advance an Opinion which he would recommend as Standards of Judgment and Action. All he means by these Scruples is to abate the Pride of _mere human Reasoners_, by showing them, that even with regard to Principles which seem the clearest, and which they are necessitated from the strongest Instincts of Nature to embrace, they are not able to attain a full Consistence and absolute Certainty. _Modesty_ then, and _Humility_, with regard to the Operations of our natural Faculties, is the Result of _Scepticism_; not an universal Doubt, which it is impossible |for any Man to support, and which the first and most trivial Accident in Life must immediately disconcert and destroy.","subId":"21","id":"Hume.LG.21","pages":"425-6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How is such a Frame of Mind prejudicial to Piety?

'Tis evident, that so extravagant a Doubt as that which Scepticism may seem to recommend, by destroying _every Thing_, really affects _nothing_, and was never intended to be understood _seriously_, but was meant as a _mere_ Philosophical Amusement, or Trial of _Wit_ and _Subtilty_.","subId":"22","id":"Hume.LG.22","pages":"426"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is a Construction suggested by the very Nature of the Subject; but he has not been contented with that, but expresly declared it.

All the antient Fathers, as well as our first Reformers, are copious in representing the Weakness and Uncertainty of _mere_ human Reason. And Monsieur _Huet_ the learned Bishop of _Avaranches_ (so celebrated for his _Demonstration Evangelique_ which contains all the great Proofs of the Christian Religion) wrote also a Book on this very Topick, wherein he endeavours to revive all the Doctrines of the antient _Scepticks_ or _Pyrrhonians_.","subId":"24","id":"Hume.LG.24","pages":"426"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In Reality, whence come all the various Tribes of Hereticks, the _Arians_, _Socinians_ and _Deists_, but from too great a Confidence in mere human Reason, which they regard as the _Standard_ of every Thing, and which they will not submit to the superior Light of Revelation? And can one do a more essential Service to Piety, than by showing them that this boasted Reason of theirs, so far from accounting for the great Mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation, is not able fully to satisfy itself with regard to its own Operations, and must in some Measure fall into a Kind of implicite Faith, even in the most obvious and familiar Principles?","subId":"25","id":"Hume.LG.25","pages":"426"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"II. The Author is charged with Opinions leading to _downright Atheism_, chiefly by denying this Principle, _That whatever begins to exist must have a Cause of Existence_. To give you a Notion of the Extravagance of this Charge, I must enter into a little Detail. It is common for Philosophers to distinguish the Kinds of Evidence into _intuitive_, _demonstrative_, _sensible_, and _moral_; by which they intend _only_ to mark a Difference betwixt them, not to denote a Superiority of one above another. _Moral Certainty_ may reach as _high_ a Degree of Assurance as _Mathematical_; and our Senses are surely to be comprised amongst the clearest |and most convincing of all Evidences. Now, it being the Author's Purpose, in the Pages cited in the Specimen, to examine the Grounds of that Proposition; he used the Freedom of disputing the common Opinion, that it was founded on _demonstrative_ or _intuitive Certainty_; but asserts, that it is supported by _moral Evidence_, and is followed by a Conviction of the same Kind with these Truths, _That all Men must die_, and that _the Sun will rise To-morrow_. Is this any Thing like denying the Truth of that Proposition, which indeed _a Man must have lost all common Sense to doubt of?_","subId":"26","id":"Hume.LG.26","pages":"426-7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But, granting that he had denied it, how is this a Principle that leads to Atheism? It would be no difficult Matter to show, that the Arguments _a posteriori_ from the Order and Course of Nature, these Arguments so sensible, so convincing, and so obvious, remain still in their full Force; and that nothing is affected by it but the _metaphysical_ Argument _a priori_, which many Men of Learning cannot comprehend, and which many Men both of Piety and Learning show no great Value for. Bishop _Tillotson_ has used a Degree of Freedom on this Head, which I would not willingly allow myself; 'tis in his excellent Sermon _concerning the Wisdom of being religious_, where he says, _That the Being of a God is not capable of Demonstration, but of moral Evidence_. I hope none will pretend that that pious Prelate intended by these Assertions to weaken the Evidences for a Divine Existence, but only to distinguish accurately its Species of Evidence.","subId":"27","id":"Hume.LG.27","pages":"427"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I say further, that even the metaphysical Arguments for a Deity are not affected by a Denial of the Proposition above-mentioned. It is only Dr. _Clark_'s Argument which can be supposed to be any way concerned. Many other Arguments of the same Kind still remain; _Des Cartes_'s for Instance, which has always been esteemed as solid and convincing as the other. I shall add, that a great Distinction ought always to be made betwixt a Man's positive and avowed Opinions, and the Inferences which it may please others to draw from them. Had the Author really denied the Truth of the foregoing Proposition (which the most superficial Reader cannot think ever entred his Head) still he could not properly be charged as designing to invalidate any one Argument that any Philosopher has employed for a _Divine Existence_; that is only an Inference and Construction of others, which he may refuse if he thinks proper.","subId":"28","id":"Hume.LG.28","pages":"427"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus you may judge of the Candor of the whole Charge, when you see the assigning of _one Kind of Evidence_ for a Proposition, instead of _another_, is called denying that Proposition; that the invalidating only _one Kind_ of Argument for the Divine Existence is called _positive Atheism_; nay, that the weakning only of _one individual Argument_ of that Kind is called rejecting that _whole Species of Argument_, and the Inferences of others are ascribed to the Author as his real Opinion.","subId":"29","id":"Hume.LG.29","pages":"427"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis impossible ever to satisfy a captious Adversary, but it would be easy for me to convince the severest Judge, that all the solid Arguments for Natural Religion retain their full Force upon the Author's Principles concerning Causes and Effects, and that there is no Necessity even for altering the common Methods of expressing or conceiving these Arguments. The Author has indeed asserted, That we can judge only of the Operations of Causes by Experience, |and that, reasoning _a priori_, any thing might appear able to produce any thing. We could not know that Stones would descend, or Fire burn, had we not Experience of these Effects; and indeed, without such Experience, we could not certainly infer the Existence of one Thing from that of another. This is no great Paradox, but seems to have been the Opinion of several Philosophers, and seems the most obvious and familiar Sentiment on that Subject; but, tho' all Inferences concerning Matter of Fact be thus resolved into Experience, these Inferences are noway weakned by such an Assertion, but on the contrary will be found to acquire more Force, as long as Men are disposed to trust to their Experience rather than to mere human Reasoning. Wherever I see Order, I infer from Experience that _there_, there hath been Design and Contrivance. And the same Principle which leads me into this Inference, when I contemplate a Building, regular and beautiful in its whole Frame and Structure; the same Principle obliges me to infer an infinitely perfect Architect, from the infinite Art and Contrivance which is display'd in the whole Fabrick of the Universe. Is not this the Light in which this Argument hath been placed by all Writers concerning Natural Religion?","subId":"30","id":"Hume.LG.30","pages":"427-8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"III. The next Proof of Atheism is so unaccountable, that I know not what to make of it. Our Author indeed asserts, after the present pious and learned Bishop of _Cloyne_, That we have no _abstract_ or _general Ideas_, properly so speaking; and that those Ideas, which are called general, are nothing but particular Ideas affixed to general Terms. Thus, when I think of a Horse in general, I must always conceive that Horse as black or white, fat or lean, _&c_. and can form no Notion of a Horse that is not of some particular Colour or Size. In Prosecution of the same Topick, the Author hath said, That we have no general Idea of Existence, distinct from every particular Existence. But a Man must have strange Sagacity, that could discover Atheism in so harmless a Proposition. This, in my Opinion, might be justified before the University of _Salamanca_, or a _Spanish_ Inquisition. I do indeed believe, that, when we assert the Existence of a Deity, we do not form a general abstract Idea of Existence, which we unite with the Idea of God, and which is capable of forming a compound Idea by Union; but this is the Case with regard to every Proposition concerning Existence. So that, by this Course of Reasoning, we must deny the Existence of every Thing, even of ourselves, of which at least even the Accuser himself will admit our Author is perswaded.","subId":"31","id":"Hume.LG.31","pages":"428"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"IV. Ere answering the fourth Charge, I must use the Freedom to deliver a short History of a particular Opinion in Philosophy. When Men considered the several Effects and Operations of Nature, they were led to examine into the Force or Power by which they were performed; and they divided into several Opinions upon this Head, according as their _other_ Principles were more or less favourable to Religion. The Followers of _Epicurus_ and _Strato_ asserted, That this Force was original and inherent in Matter, and, operating blindly, produced all the various Effects which we behold. The _Platonick_ and _Peripatetick_ Schools, perceiving the Absurdity of this Proposition, ascribed the Origin of all Force to one primary efficient Cause, who first bestowed it on Matter, and successively |guided it in all its Operations. But all the antient Philosophers agreed, that there was a real Force in Matter, either original or derived; and that it was really Fire which burnt, and Food that nourished, when we observed any of these Effects to follow upon the Operations of these Bodies: The Schoolmen supposed also a real Power in Matter, to whose Operations however the continual Concurrence of the Deity was requisite, as well as to the Support of that Existence which had been bestowed on Matter, and which they considered as a perpetual Creation. No one, till _Des Cartes_ and _Malbranche_, ever entertained an Opinion that Matter had no Force either _primary_ or _secondary_, and _independent_ or _concurrent_, and could not so much as properly be called an _Instrument_ in the Hands of the Deity, to serve any of the Purposes of Providence. These Philosophers last-mentioned substituted the Notion of _occasional Causes_, by which it was asserted that a Billiard Ball did not move another by its Impulse, but was only the Occasion why the Deity, in pursuance of general Laws, bestowed Motion on the second Ball. But, tho' this Opinion be very innocent, it never gained great Credit, especially in _England_, where it was considered as too much contrary to received popular Opinions, and too little supported by Philosophical Arguments, ever to be admitted as any Thing but a _mere Hypothesis_. _Cudworth_, _Lock_ and _Clark_ make little or no mention of it. Sir _Isaac Newton_ (tho' some of his Followers have taken a different Turn of thinking) plainly rejects it, by substituting the Hypothesis of an {AE}therial Fluid, not the immediate Volition of the Deity, as the Cause of Attraction. And, in short, this has been a Dispute left entirely to the Arguments of Philosophers, and in which Religion has never been supposed to be in the least concerned.","subId":"32","id":"Hume.LG.32","pages":"428-9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now it is evidently concerning this _Cartesian Doctrine_, of _secondary Causes_, the Author is treating, when he says, (in the Passage referred to in the Charge) _That it was a curious Opinion, but which it would appear superfluous to examine in that Place_.","subId":"33","id":"Hume.LG.33","pages":"429"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Topick there handled is somewhat abstract: But I believe any Reader will easily perceive the Truth of this Assertion, and that the Author is far from pretending to deny (as asserted in the Charge) _God's being the first Cause and prime Mover of the Universe_.

In this Opinion he concurs with all the antient Moralists, as well as with Mr. _Hutchison_ Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of _Glasgow_, who, with others, has revived the antient Philosophy in this Particular.

But of these his Accuser takes no Notice. By the _natural Virtues_ he plainly understands _Compassion_ and _Generosity_, and such as we are immediately carried to by a _natural Instinct_; and by the _artificial Virtues_ he means _Justice_, _Loyalty_, and such as require, along with a _natural Instinct_, a certain Reflection on the general Interests of Human Society, and a Combination with others. In the same Sense, Sucking is an Action natural to Man, and Speech is artificial. But what is there in this Doctrine that can be supposed in the least pernicious? Has he not expresly asserted, That Justice, in another Sense of the Word, is so natural to Man, that no Society of Men, and even no individual Member of any Society, was ever entirely devoid of all Sense of it? Some Persons (tho' without any Reason, in my Opinion) are displeased with Mr. _Hutchison_'s Philosophy, in founding all the Virtues so much on _Instinct_, and admitting so little of _Reason_ and _Reflection_. Those should be pleased to find that so considerable a Branch of the Moral Duties are founded on that Principle.","subId":"38","id":"Hume.LG.38","pages":"430"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Author has likewise taken care in positive Terms to assert, That he does not maintain that Men ly under no Obligation to observe Contracts, independent of Society; but only, that they never would have formed Contracts, and even would not have understood the Meaning of them, independent of Society. And whereas it is observed in the Specimen, That our Author offers further to prove, that, suppose a Promise was intelligible before Human Conventions had established it, it would not be attended with any Moral Obligation. The most careless Reader must perceive that he does not understand _Moral_ in such an extended Sense, as to deny the Obligation of Promises, independent of Society; seeing he not only asserts what is above-represented, but likewise that the Laws of Justice are universal, and perfectly inflexible. It is evident, that suppose Mankind, in some primitive unconnected State, should by some Means come to the Knowledge of the Nature of those Things which we call Contracts and Promises; that this Knowledge would have laid them under no such actual Obligation, if not placed in such Circumstances as give rise to these Contracts.","subId":"39","id":"Hume.LG.39","pages":"430"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am sorry I should be obliged to cite from my Memory, and cannot mention Page and Chapter so accurately as the Accuser.

I am indeed of Opinion, that the Author had better delayed the publishing of that Book; not on account of any dangerous Principles contained in it, but because on more mature Consideration he might have rendered it much less imperfect by further Corrections and Revisals. I must not at the same Time omit observing, that nothing can be wrote so accurately or innocently, which may not be perverted by such Arts as have been imployed on this Occasion. No Man would undertake so invidious a Task as that of our Author's Accuser, who was not actuated by particular Interests; and you know how easy it is, by broken and partial Citations, to pervert any Discourse, much more one of so abstract a Nature, where it is difficult, or almost impossible, to justify one's self to the Publick. The Words which have been carefully pickt out from a large Volume will no doubt have a dangerous Aspect to careless Readers; and the Author, in my Apprehension, cannot fully defend himself without a particular Detail, which it is impossible for a careless Reader to enter into. This Advantage of the Ground has been trusted to by his Accuser, and surely never more abused than on the present Occasion. But he has one Advantage, I trust, which is worth a Hundred of what his Opposers can boast of, {~~viz.->_viz._~~} _that of Innocence_; and I hope he has also another Advantage, _viz._ _that of Favour_, if we really live in a Country of Freedom, where Informers and Inquisitors are so deservedly held in universal Detestation, where Liberty, at least of Philosophy, is so highly valu'd and esteem'd.
