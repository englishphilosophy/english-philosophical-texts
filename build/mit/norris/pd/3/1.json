For need any Power or Faculty be under any other Law, than that of its own _Nature_, to delight in its proper Object? Does the Sense want a Precept to be pleased with sensible Good? Need we address our selves to the Eye to persuade it to love Light, or take pains to exhort the Ear to delight in harmonious Sounds? No, the Order of Nature does here supersede all other Methods of Engagement, and why then should there be need of any Command to a _Rational_ Soul to love _God_? Does not an intelligible Good bear the same proportion to a reasonable Nature, as a sensible Good does to Sense; and is not God the same to the Soul, as Musick is to the Ear, or as Light to the Eye? Yes certainly, and infinitely more: For these things, tho they are the _proper_ Goods of their respective Powers, yet they are not wholly commensurate, and fully adjusted to their Capacities; whence it is that _they Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with hearing_. But now God is not only the proper Good of the Soul (as Light is of the Eye) but is withal a Good so transcendently excellent as to be able to fill the whole Capacity of its intellectual Powers. The Good of _his_ sublime Nature is more than commensurate to the most stretch'd Appetite of _ours_; nay, were our Capacity infinite, he would be sufficient to fill it; for he fills his own, and is infinitely happy in himself.

And accordingly the Love of God being the fundamental Principle of all natural Religion and Virtue, or (as our Lord here terms it) the _first and great Commandment_, upon which all the Duties of the first Table do immediately, and those of the second remotely depend, it was very requisite that there should be an express Precept concerning it, tho it be never so _evident_ that we _ought_ to love God, and withal never so _necessary_ and unavoidable that we _should_.","subId":"2","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Besides, 'tis also secondly to be consider'd, that what does here more principally and more directly fall under the Precept, is not the _Act_ of loving God in general, but the special _degree_ and manner of that Act, that it be with the whole Power and full Capacity of the Man.

This is not a Proposition of so bright an evidence as to shine forth by its own Light, but requires a Train of Argument and Consequence to make it appear reasonable, and must be proved in a way of Science and Demonstration. It was indeed below the Dignity and Majesty of the Supreme Law-giver to do that, but therefore it was the more necessary for him to use his Authority, to make it matter of express Precept, and to lay it as an eternal Law upon every rational Spirit that comes into being, _Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind_.","subId":"3","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The great Difficulty of this great Commandment, next to the _Practising_ of it, is how to _Understand_ it; and therefore I shall first of all inquire into the true Sense and Import of it, and then into the Reason and Bottom upon which it stands.","subId":"4","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the _Sense_, I think the highest that is generally put upon these Words amounts to no more than this, That God is to be the prime and principal Object of our Love and Delight; That we are to love him in a _Superlative_ way, above all other things whatsoever, so as to lose any Good, or suffer any Evil rather than commit the least Sin against him; That we are always to prefer him in our Love, chusing to obey him rather than Man, and to please him rather than satisfie our own Will, and to enjoy him rather than any worldly or carnal Pleasure, saying with the Psalmist, _Thy Loving-kindness is better than Life_, and with the Church in the _Canticles_, _Thy Love is better than Wine_.","subId":"5","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And if our Love be thus order'd, if we stand thus affected towards God, we are then allowed according to the common Opinion to Love _Creatures_, to delight and solace our selves in them, to unite our Souls in some measure to them, and to reckon them among the props and stays of our life, and as the Ingredients of its present Happiness.

Sure they could not but be sensible that herein they did not rise up to the Letter of the Text, which manifestly requires a more elevated sense: But they could not advance higher without building in the Air; and were therefore forced to cramp the sense of this great Commandment, and to put such a Construction upon it, not as the express Words of it _require_, but as their Hypothesis would _bear_.","subId":"7","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I say as their Hypothesis would bear; for the Hypothesis these Men go upon, seems to be this; They suppose that other things besides God are truly and properly the Goods of the Soul, and contribute as efficient Causes to its happiness: That sensible Objects contain in themselves somewhat answerable to what we feel by their Occasion, and are withal the proper Causes of such our Sensations: That the Bodies that surround us do really act in and upon us, not only by making impression upon our _Bodies_, and striking upon our Organs of _Sense_, but also by raising and exciting those Sensations our Spirits are conscious of, so as to be the true efficient Causes of our _Pleasure_ and our _Pain_: That the Fire gives us that sentiment of Heat which we feel when we approach it: and, That Wine causes in us that pleasing Taste which we feel when we drink it: And the like.","subId":"8","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now I confess, if this _Hypothesis_ be true, if sensible Objects do really act upon our Souls, and are the proper efficient Causes of those pleasing Sensations which we feel there, then 'twill necessarily follow, that a certain portion of my Love is due to these sensible Objects: for, if these Objects produce Pleasure in me, then they do me good, they perfect my Being, and render it more happy; and if they do me good, then in their proportion they are my good; and if they are in any degree my good, then they are so far lovely; and if they are in any way lovely, then so far they ought to be loved. But now, if some part of our Love be due to sensible Objects (as upon this _Hypothesis_ it is) then 'tis impossible that God should have a right to _all_ of it; and consequently, to love him with all the heart, and all the soul, and all the mind, can signifie no more than to love him principally and above all, to give him the _Preference_ in our Love. I say the _Preference_, for it seems the Creatures put in for a share; and if they have a part, 'tis impossible that God should have the whole: they must then both go sharers in our Affection, and the only Privilege which God can claim upon this _Hypothesis_, is, to have the _largest_ share in our Love.","subId":"9","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whether this _Hypothesis_ be true of no, shall be consider'd in its proper place; in the mean while if may serve as a strong Presumption, that it is not, that the Explication which is founded upon it falls so very short of the literal Emphasis of the Text, _Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all the soul, and with all thy mind_. But is it to love God at this rate, to love him only principally and more than any thing else? Does this exhaust the sense of this great Commandment? Can he be said with any tolerable sense to love God with all his heart, all his soul, and all his mind, that only love him above other things, at the same time allowing other things a share in his Love? Can he be said to love God with _all_ his Love that loves him only with a _Part_? What though that PArt be the larger Part, 'tis but a Part still; and is a _Part_ the _Whole_?

In one Word, that God be not only the principal, but the only Oject of our Love.

In the same Sense therefore as 'tis said, _Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve_; so is this great Commandment to be understood, as if it were said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou desire.

That he is also the only proper Object of it.","subId":"13","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"First, I consider that God is the only Author or Cause of our Love. By Love here I understand that original Weight, Bent or Endeavour whereby the Soul of Man stands inclined and is moved forwards to Good in general or _Happiness_. Now that this Impression is from God, and that 'tis he alone that has put this _Biass_ into our Natures, I think demonstrable several ways; but at present shall only consider that this Motion of the Soul is a necessary Adherent to our Beings, such as we were never without, and such as we can never put off; such as is all over invincible and irresistable. The Soul of Man must not pretend to the least degree of Liberty here (for indeed it being impossible that our Love to Good in general should be bad, it was not fit it should be free) but is altogether passive in this Motion, and moves no otherwise than as she is moved. She has no more Command over this Motion than she has over the Motion of the _Heart_ or _Pulse_, which shews it to be equally _Vital_ and Natural, and of the very essential Make and Constitution of our Being. Well then, I demand, Is this natural necessary Motion from our _Selves_ or from _God_? If from our Selves, How comes it then to pass, that we cannot command it, or stop it? Had we Power to produce what we have not Power to govern? or, is it more difficult to govern than to produce? No certainly, were we the Authors of this Motion we should have some Power over it, and be able to manage and controul it; which since we cannot do, we may well conclude, that 'tis not a thing of our Production; and that though it be _in_ us, yet 'tis not _of_ or _from_ our Selves. And whence then must it be but from God? Who else could kindle in our Natures such an unquenchable Flame? Who else could fix such a strong _Spring_ in our Souls, and actuate our Beings with such a mighty Energy? And who should be the Author of what is _Natural_ and Necessary in us, but he that is the Author of our _Natures_? Love is the same in the Moral and intellectual World as Motion is in the Natural; and as we make God to be the Author of Natural Motion, so there is as much reason to make him the Author of our Love. But now if God be the only Author and Cause of our Love, has not he then the sole Right and Title to it? and has not he also a Right to it all? This may seem perhaps at first glance to be a captious and surprizing way of Arguing; but consider it well; Has not God a Right to all that he _produces_? What is it that gives him a Right to the whole World, but his Production of it? Why has God a Right to me, but because I am his Creature? Upon what Account has he a Right to all my Powers and Faculties, and to all the service of them, but because he produces them, and sustains them; because _in him we Live, Move, and have our being_? But now if God does as much produce my _Love_ as he does my _Being_, then, Why has he not as much Right to my Love as to any other part of my Nature? And if God only has a Right to it all, as having produced it all, then 'tis evident, that all of it ought to be fix'd upon him, and that he has great Injury and Injustice done him whenever any the least degree of it goes besides him. Indeed were there any part or degree of our Love which God did not produce, That we might give away from him, That we might bestow upon a Creature; but if God be the Author of it all, if there be not one degree of our Love but what he produces, 'tis highly just and reasonable that he should have it all; and we cannot let the least Spark of this sacred Fire light upon the Creature without so far defrauding the Creator.","subId":"14","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Especially if we consider further the Manner how, and the End for which God produces our Love. I now suppose, as a thing already proved, that all the Motion that the Soul has towards Good comes from God; but how does God move us towards Good? Whither is it that God does then direct this Motion? He himself indeed is the _Author_ of it, but what is the _Term_ of it? to what does God move us? Our corrupt Imagination may perhaps be ready here to suggest that God moves us to Good by moving us towards the _Creature_. But stay, Would such a _Term_ of this Motion be worthy of its _Cause_? Can God move us towards the Creature? Can he move us from himself? Can he act for a Creature? Can he make the Creature his End? Does not God make all things for himself? Does he not always act for himself? Is he not always his own End? Has not this the Evidence of a First Principle, That God acts only for himself? We must therefore of necessity conclude, That as God is the Author of this Motion, so he is the Natural End and Term of it too; and that he moves us to Good no otherwise, than by moving us towards himself. We must conclude, that God is the true great _Magnet_ of our Souls; that he continually draws and moves them, not from, but to himself, as being both _their_, and his _own_ great End. We must conclude, that God intended himself as the sole Object of the Love which he produced; that he has imprest a Motion upon our Intellectual Heart, only to incline it toward himself; and that as the whole Motion of our Love is from God, so it has no other Term than God in the Order and Institution of Nature.","subId":"15","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Well then, if the Case be thus, if God moves us to Good by moving us towards himself: Is it not then a transgressing this Order and Institution of Nature?

Do we not then Cross the Order of Nature, and resist the Will of its great Author? Do we not then hinder his Act, and put a Bar to his Motion within us? Nay, do we not then act against the Constitution of our own Frame, and run Counter to the great Bias of our Natures? What, does he that gave us our Beings, shew also so great a Concern for their _Perfection_, as to impress upon them a continual Motion towards himself; and shall we be so ungrateful as well as unjust, as to stop short, and take up with a Creature? We ought certainly to follow the Order, and conform to the Will of God; and since he has order'd the Motion of our Love to no less Noble an End than himself, 'tis evident that thither only we ought to _direct_, and there only to _fix_ our Love.","subId":"16","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And that we do not at all strain the Sense of this Commandment, by supposing it thus to oblige us to Love the Lord our God with _all the Heart, Soul and Mind_, in the strictest Emphasis of the Phrase, will yet further appear, if we examin the other general gound upon which it stands, and consider","subId":"17","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Secondly, That as God is the only Author and Cause of our Love, so is he also the only proper Object of it.

And yet she has had the ill Fortune to be least of all consulted in this matter. It is generally thought, that the Pleasure we feel in the Use, and by the Intervention of Bodies is caused in us by the Bodies themselves. That the Fire for instance, produces in us {++the++} Sensation of Warmth, that the Sun produces in us the Sensation of Light, that the Fruits of the Earth Communicate to us the Sensations of the plesant Tastes, and the like. These Bodies are first supposed to have something like these Sensations in themselves, and the to produce them in us. Thus Fire is supposed to be endued with the quality of Heat in itself, and then to impart this _quality_ to us; to be first Hot in its own Nature, and then to make us so. This has been all along the Current unquestion'd Apprehension, not only of the Vulgar who think in haste, and determin of things only as they appear to Sense, but of the more inquisitive and reasoning part of Mankind. And though some of the Modern _Reformers_ of Philosophy have thought fit to reject the _former_ part of the Supposition, _viz._ That Bodies have in themselves something answerable to the Sensations which we feel in the use of them; yet they generally retain the _Later_, _viz._ That they produce and cause those Sensations in us, and do accordingly allow, that Fire (for instance) is _Eminently_ and _Potentially_, though not _Formally_ hot, that is, That though it has not any thing resembling the Sensation of Heat in it self, yet it has a Power to produce such a Sensation in those that shall approach it. This they not only _allow_, but _contend_ for. For whereas according to the Old Distinction, some things were said to be both Formally and Eminently hot too (as Fire) and some only eminently, (as the Sun) the Moderns have ventured to cut off the former part of the Distinction, and reduce all to the later, by supposing all Bodies that we call Hot, to be so only _Eminently_ and _Potentially_, as they are productive of Heat in us. And by this they explain the _Phenomenon_ of Heat in Bodies, supposing it to be nothing else in the Bodies themselves, but only a Power of producing such a Sensation. But then by this they manifestly hold that they do produce it; and I know but of[n1] One amongst them that thinks any _Otherwise_, or any _Farther_. They thought, it seems, they had sufficiently reform'd the Vulgar Philosophy, by shaking off the former part of their Hypothesis, That Bodies have in themselves some inherent Quality analogous to our Sensations; so much they saw must be rejected. But they could not tell how to deny the later part, and do therefore hold, that Bodies do produce in us such and such Sensations, though they have nothing of a Similar Nature with them in themselves.","subId":"19","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Very good.

This is the only reason that is, or can be pretended in behalf of this Common Presumption. But is this a Warrantable Conclusion? Does it follow, that because such Sensations do accompany such Bodily Impressions, that therefore those Bodily Impressions are the Cause of those Sensations? Can we argue from the _Concomitancy_ of one thing with another, to the _Causal Dependence_ of the one thing upon another?

Nay, they would have seen, that the very same Reasons that induced them to the one, ought also to have determin'd them to the other. For why is it that they will not allow that Bodies have in them something like our Sensations, particularly that in Fire there is any such thing as a Quality of Heat, answerable to what we call Heat in our selves: I say, why is it that they will not allow this, but because they reason'd with themselves to this effect: There is nothing conceivable in Bodies but _Magnitude_, _Figure_, and _Motion_? For instance, there is nothing in Fire but certain Particles of Matter so and so sized, so and so figured, and so and so moved. Examin your Idea of Fire a thousand time over, and this is all you will ever be able to find in it. I say find _in_ it: For 'tis true indeed, when you come near you find something more _from_ it, you find withall a Sensation of _Heat_, either pleasing or painful according as your distance is. But you have no more reason thence to conclude, that there is such a Quality as Heat, resembling  what you feel, in the Fire, than you have to conclude _Pain_ to be in a _Needle_ or a _Thorn_. When you approach the Fire you feel Heat, and when you prick your Hand with a Needle you feel Pain; but as you _do_ not therefore fancy any such thing as Pain to be in the Needle, so neither _ought_ you to suppose any such thing as Heat to be in the Fire. That indeed which makes Men more apt to do so in this Case than in the other is, because the Particles of the Fire are too Minute to be discern'd by the Eye, and so Men not perceiving the _Mechanicalness_ of its Operation, are apt to have recourse to some inherent _Quality_; whereas the Thorn and Needle are of a Visible Bulk, and we see how they pierce and wound our Flesh. But did Men as clearly see the Particles of the Fire, with their Size, Figure and Motion, and with what a Spring they are shot and darted forth upon us, and how like so many fine Needles or Launces they enter and divide the parts of our Body, they would no more Dream of any such thing as _Heat_ in the _Fire_, than they do of _Pain_ in a _Needle_, and would think it every whit as odd and improper to say, Fire is _Hot_, as to say a Needle is _Painful_. And though as the Case now stands, they are apt to fancy the contrary; yet 'tis plain, that this is only an illusion of Sense, Reason in the mean while constantly assuring us, that there can be nothing in Fire but Particles of Matter of such a Size and Shape, and in such a degree of Motion: And withall, that we cannot ascribe such a thing as Heat to the Fire, answerable to that Sensation in our selves, without ascribing to it also _Thought_ and _Perception_ at the same time, which would be of intolerable Consequence.","subId":"22","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon these, and such like Considerations, the Reformers of Philosophy, I presume, thought it necessary to reject the former part of the Vulgar Hypothesis, that Bodies have in them some certain Qualities answerable to our Sensations. And no doubt but that they reason'd upon clear and distinct Idea's. But will not the very same Considerations be of equal force to disprove the later part too, that Bodies do _cause_ and _produce_ Sensations in us? For if there be nothing in Bodies but _Motion_ and _Figure_, if they are capable of no other Modification, then whatever they do, they must do it by the Motion, and by the Figure of their Parts; there being nothing besides supposed to be in them. If therefore they cause our Sensations, 'tis by their Figure and their Motion that they must do it. But can Motion of Figure produce a Sensation, a Sentiment of the Mind, a _Thought_? 'Tis hard, extreme hard, to conceive how one Motion should beget another. But can it produce an Effect more Noble and Excellent, and of an Order so very much higher than it self? Can it produce a Thought? Is there any Proportion between such a Cause and such an Effect; between Motion and Thinking, between an Affection of a Body, and a Sentiment of the Soul? Or is there any proportion between such a _particular_ Motion, and such a _particular_ Sensation; between that Motion, suppose, that is follow'd with Pleasure, and Pleasure; or between that Motion which is follow'd with Pain, and Pain? Is that Motion which _de facto_ is accompanied with Pleasure, more apt of its self and in its own Nature, to produce that Sensation rather than Pain? Or may not that very Motion which is _de facto_ follow'd with Pleasure, be as well the Occasion of Pain for any Proportion, Affinity, or Natural Connexion that is in the things themselves? 'Tis most certain that it may. For Pleasure and Pain are Sensations of so wholly different, nay contrary a kind. They differ as much as any two things can do. They differ not only Essentially, but as Contraries, as extreme Opposites. And they do almost make their _Subjects_ do so, the Soul that is in Pleasure differing almost _Specifically_ from her self when she is in Pain. But now there is not the like difference between the respective Motions supposed to produce them; They differ only Accidentally and Gradually. That Motion of the Fire which occasions Pleasure, differs only in Degree from that which occasions Pain. Whence it is evident, that these Causes are not in themselves equivalent to their Effects, nor have any Natural Relation to them, but are indifferent to either, as being disproportionate to both. That the same Motion that is now attended with Pleasure, might as well (for any particularity in the thing it self) be attended with Pain, there being as great disproportion between these particular Motions and their particular Sensations, as between Motion and Sensation in general.","subId":"23","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What is here said of _Motion_, is as applicable to _Figure_; and since these are the only two Modifications Body is capable of, and these hold no proportion with our Sensations, 'tis plain that our Sensations ought not, cannot be ascribed to Bodies as their proper Efficient Causes.

And can any Two things that are really distinct one from the other, be so united or connected together in their own natures, that an impression made upon the one, shall by the same act affect the other?

For if such a Sensation did naturally and directly follow such an Impression of the Fire as an Effect follows its proper Cause, then what need of any _Law_ or _Order_ to be establish'd, that such a Sensation should follow such an Impression? 'Tis plain therefore, that the Sensation produced in the Soul at the Impression of the Fire, is to be resolved into this _Law_ as its proper Cause, and can depend upon the Impression no otherwise, than as an _Occasion_, or a _Condition_ determining the Efficiency of this Law.

For if my own Spirit were the Cause of those Sensations which I feel at the Impressions which other Bodies make upon mine, it would then be in my Power to have those Sensations as well without the Impressions of Bodies as with them. I might then have the Sensation of Light without the Impression of the Sun, and the Sensation of Heat without Fire, and the Sensation of sweet Odours and Tasts without the Mediation of odorifick or sapid Bodies. For since these Bodies are supposed according to the Principles before laid down not to have any Concurrence by way of _Efficiency_ in the Production of those Sensations, but only to serve as positive Conditions to determin the Action of that Cause (whatever it is) which does produce them, certainly it must be in the Power of that Cause to produce those Sensations without any such bodily Impressions, nay, though there were no such thing as Body in being. As he that made the Waters of _Marah_ sweet by throwing in of a Tree, might if he had so pleas'd, as well have made them sweet without it.

But alas this is not enough, this will not serve in case God be our _Only Good_, as we have clearly proved that he is; and as we are plainly told that he is, in our Saviours Answer to him that call'd him Good Master, _Why callest thou me good, there is none good but one, that is God_. Interpreters have been strangely put to't to accommodate this Text with a convenient Gloss, to define in what sense this is to be taken, _That there is none good but God_. One will have it, _None _Originally_ good but God_. Another, _None _Supremely_ good but God_. And a third, _None _Perfectly_ good but God_. And a Fourth, _None _Infinitely_ good but God_. But 'tis plain, that these all shoot below the Mark. The Text says a great deal more than any, or all of this amounts to; it says absolutely and indefinitely, without any Limitation, _That there is none good but God_: Or, _That God is the _Only good. And this agrees exactly with the Hypothesis now laid down and proved, which will not only _bear_, but _require_ this literal sense of the Words. For by this it appears, that in the strictest sense, _There is none good but God_, because there is none but he that acts in us, and is the true Cause of all the Pleasure which we do, or can ever enjoy. It all flows, not only from his _Bounty_, but from his very _Operation_; and is not only his _Gift_, but his _Production_: Which certainly is ground enough to ascribe to him the Title of _the only Good_. Other things indeed may be said to be good in _themselves_ after a Metaphysical way of speaking, in the same sense as God is said to have pronounc'd all things good that he had made, that is, _Metaphysically_, as having all that was requisite to the Integrity and Perfection of their Natural Beings, according to such a Rank or Order in the Creation. In this sense indeed the Creatures are good; for God can make nothing but what is so: But they are not _our_ good, they are not good to us, because they do us none, as not being able to affect us with so much as one pleasing Sentiment, to add so much as one real degree of Happiness to our Being. No, God is the true Author and Cause of it all; 'tis he that _puts gladness into our Hearts_, and diffuses his Divine Sweetness throughout our Souls; and therefore he only is our Good, and he only ought to be the Object of all our Love.

Ye cannot serve God and Mammon._ Here we are plainly told, that we cannot divide between God and the Creature; but that the adhering to the one is the rejecting of the other. And the reason is, not only because our Natural Faculties and Capacities are too Narrow and Scanty to be employ'd upon two such vastly different Objects; but also because we cannot love either of them but upon such a _Principle_ as must utterly exclude the love of the other. For we must not love any thing but what is our true Good, what can both deserve and reward our Love. And there can be but one thing that is so. It must either be God or the Creature.

I know but of one sort of Spiritual Sin besides that is call'd _Adultery_ in Scripture, and that is the Sin of _Idolatry_, which goes frequently by the Name of going a _Whoring_ after other Gods. And so in like manner the Love of the Creature is here said to be _Adultery_, which implies that they are in great measure the same, as having one common Name, and that every Lover of the Creature is in his proportion an Idolater. And so upon our former Principle he is. For by loving Creatures we suppose them our Goods, that they are able to act upon our Souls and affect them with pleasing Sensations, that they perfect our Being and are the Causes of our Happiness, which is to suppose them to be as so many Gods.

The Apostle here first of all supposes the World to be crucified, that is, to be a dead, unactive, silent and quiescent thing in respect of himself, as not being able to operate upon him, or affect his Soul with any Sentiment as a true, proper Efficient Cause, and then in Consequence of that declares himself to be also crucified to the World, not only indifferently or moderately affected towards it, but perfectly dead and cold to all its Imbraces, and altogether insensible and unmoved at all its Charms.

To this the Answer is very easie and very clear. If our Love to God and our Neighbour were of the same kind, the entire Love of the former would indeed wholly exclude that of the later. But this is not the Case. We are not here supposed to love God in the same sense, or with the same sort of Love wherewith we love our Neighbour. We do not love God by wishing any Good to him (whereof he is not capable) but by wishing him as a Good to our selves. On the contrary, we do not, or at least should not love our Neighbour by wishing him as a Good to our selves, (for he is not our Good) but by wishing Good to him. That is in short, we love God with the love of _Desire_, and we love our Neighbour with the Love of _Benevolence_ or Charity. But now the entire Desire of God is very consistent with all manner of Benevolence to our Neighbour. It does indeed wholly exclude all love of Desire towards him.

Yes, if Bodies were the true Causes of your pleasure, you might, nay you ought to love them, as being upon that supposition your proper Good. But this is the very thing they are defective in; we have clear and incontestable Reasonto assure us, that they are not the true real Causes of any of our Sensations. But however, there is Pleasure, you'll say, _annex'd_ to them; for we feel Pleasure in the _Use_ of such and such sensible things. True, we do so, but the most that ought to be concluded from hence is, that we may _seek_ and _use_ these sensible things, to which by the Order and Institution of Nature, Pleasure is annex'd: As on the contrary, that we are to shun and avoid those sensible things to which is annex'd the opposite Sentiment of Pain. But it will not hence follow, that either the former is to be loved, or the later to be fear'd. 'Tis true indeed, that Pleasure it self is always lovely, and so is the true Cause of it. We must love whatever is able to cause Pleasure in us, and in whose power it is to make us Happy. But then we must take heed lest we mistake that for the true _Efficient Cause_ which is only the _Occasion_; lest we attribute our Sensations to Bodies as their proper Effect, to the production of which they serve only as Positive _Conditions_, determning the Operation of God, the only true Efficient Cause. So much indeed must be allow'd them, but our Reason will not suffer us to allow them any more; and though in regard that they do so much they may be innocently _sought_ for and _used_, yet because they do no more, they must not be _loved_. As we _must_ love the Efficient Cause of our Pleasure, so we _may_ seek after, and make use of that which is the Occasion of it; but this is all, we must not advance one step higher, for we have no Warrant beyond this. So that though I may eat of a pleasant Fruit, and enjoy Pleasure in the use of it, yet I must not make it the object of my Love; I must not place any degree of Affection upon it. I am to remember, that though in the Eating of this Fruit I find my self delighted, yet this Pleasure is neither in the Fruit it self, nor from it, but that 'tis God that raises this grateful Sentiment in my Soul, and accordingly I am thankfully and devoutly to acknowledge and reverence his Divine Operation, and to _Love him_ all the while I _use_ and _enjoy_ the _other_.

So indeed it is said by some, who think they strain the Love of God to a very high Pitch, when they tell us, that we must love nothing but God, or in Order and Relation to God. So then, according to these Men, we are allow'd to love Creatures, provided it be in a way of Relation and Subordination to God, who upon this Principle is not to be the _Only_, but only the _Final_ and _Ultimate_ Object of our Love. But methinks these Men's Relative Love is very much like the Relative Worship of the Papists. They make God the only _ultimate_ Object of all Divine Worship; and so fo these Men make him the only _last_ Object of Love: But yet they allow of giving Divine Worship to a Creature, provided it be in a _transitive_ and _relative_ way; that is, provided it only pass through the Creature, and terminate upon God. And so these Men allow of bestowing our Love upon a Creature, provided it be for God's sake, or in _relation_ to God, provided it do not stop and rest at the Creature, but run on, till at last it fix upon God as its final Object. The Notions are exactly Parallel to each other, and they both shew how extreamly loath Men are to take a final leave of the Creature, to disengage intirely from sensible things. They cannot be perfectly wean'd from what they do dearly affect, and therefore would fain contrive the matter so, as in the midst of all their Love and Devotion to God, to have still some Reserve for the Creature; to maintain some little under-Current of Religion and Affection for sensible things, which they would still have leave to Worship and Love, though it be never so remotely and indirectly, though it be but in a _Relative_ way. This I take to be the true Ground and Bottom of both these Notions, the Common Disease of our Nature, the great Propensity of the Soul to sensible things, which makes Men still willing to allow them a share both in their Religion and in their Affection; and that they might do it with the better Colour, has put them upon finding out this Notable Distinction of a _Relative Worship_, and of a _Relative Love_. And truly I think one is as good as the other; that we may as well Worship the Creature with a Relative Worship, as well as Love the Creature with a Relative Love. For 'tis plain that this later Distinction does as much suppose that God only is the _proper_ Object of _Love_, as the other does suppose that he is the only _proper_ object of _Worship_, otherwise what need this Qualification of our Love to the Creature that it be _Relative_? Well, but if so, then as to worship the Creature though but _Relatively_, is to give that Worship to the Creature which is proper to God; so to love the Creature though but _Relatively_, is in like manner to give that Love to the Creature which is proper to God. And if this be thought a sufficient Reason to disallow of a _Relative Worship_, I cannot see why we should not for the ver same Reason give Sentence against this _Relative Love_, or why one should not be reckon'd Idolatry as well as the other. But to bring this Matter to a compendious Issue, the short is this; either Creatures are truly and really lovely, as being our true and proper Good, or they are not. If they are, then a Relative Love is too _little_, we ought to love them with more than a Relative Love, we ought to love them Absolutely and for themselves. But if they are not (as by a Light as clear as Day it appears they are not) then even a Relative Love is too _much_. For what is not truly lovely, is always loved too much if it be loved at all. So that either way there is no Pretence for admitting this last expedient of our Concupiscence, the Relative Love of the Creature.
