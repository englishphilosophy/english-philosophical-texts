Finally, in 1762, he published two more volumes tracing the country’s history back even further, all the way to the Celtic Britons and the Roman invasion. In 1763, the first complete set was published, but owing to the size of the work – including the now very large index included in the final volume – it had to be chopped up rather awkwardly into 8 volumes rather than 6.
