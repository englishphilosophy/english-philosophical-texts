On all extraordinary Emergences, 'tis _Courage_ and _Resolution_ saves; whilst _Cowardice_ robs us of the means of Safety, and not only deprives us of our defensive Facultys, but even runs us to the brink of Ruin, and makes us meet that Evil which of it-self wou'd never have invaded us.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But were the _Consequences_ of this Passion less injurious than we have represented; it must be allow'd still that _in it-self_ it can be no other than miserable; if it be Misery to feel Cowardice, and be haunted by those Specters and Horrors, which are proper to the Character of one who has a thorow Dread of Death. For 'tis not only when Dangers happen, and Hazards are incurr'd, that this sort of _Fear_ oppresses and distracts. If it in the least prevails, it gives no quarter, so much as at the safest stillest hour of Retreat and Quiet. Every Object suggests Thought enough to employ it. It operates when it is least observ'd by others; and enters at all times into the pleasantest parts of Life; so as to corrupt and poison all Enjoyment, and Content. One may safely aver, that by reason of this Passion alone, many a Life, if inwardly and closely view'd, wou'd be found to be thorowly miserable, tho attended with all other Circumstances which in appearance render it happy. But when we add to this, the Meannesses, and base Condescensions, occasion'd by such a passionate Concern for living; when we consider how by means of it we are driven to Actions we can never view without Dislike, and forc'd by degrees from our natural Conduct, into still greater Crookednesses and Perplexity; there is no-one, surely, so disingenuous as not to allow, that _Life,_ in this case, becomes a sorry Purchase, and is pass'd with little Freedom or Satisfaction. For how can this be otherwise, whilst every thing which is generous and worthy, even the chief _Relish, Hap__piness,_ and _Good_ of Life, is _for Life's sake_ abandon'd and renounc'd?","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And thus it seems evident, \"That to have this Affection of ^Desire^ and ^Love of Life^, #Love of Life.# too intense, or beyond a moderate degree, is against the Interest of a Creature, and contrary to his _Happiness_ and _Good._\"","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Resentment.# THERE is another Passion very different from that of _Fear,_ and which in a certain degree is equally preservative to us, and conducing to our Safety. As _that_ is serviceable, in prompting us to shun Danger; so is _this,_ in fortifying us against it, and enabling us to repel Injury, and resist Violence when offer'd. 'Tis true, that according to strict Virtue, and a just Regulation of the Affections in a wise and virtuous Man, such Efforts towards Action amount not to what is justly styl'd _Passion_ or _Commotion._ A Man of Courage may be cautious without real _Fear._ And a Man of Temper may resist or punish without _Anger._ But in ordinary Characters there must necessarily be some Mixture of the real Passions themselves; which however, in the main, are able to allay and temper one another. And thus ^Anger^ in a manner becomes necessary. 'Tis by this Passion that one Creature offering Violence to another, is deter'd from the Execution; whilst he observes how the Attempt affects his Fellow; and knows by the very Signs which accompany this rising Motion, that if the Injury be carry'd further, it will not pass easily, or with impunity. 'Tis this Passion withal, which, after Violence and Hostility executed, rouzes a Creature in opposition, and, assists him in returning like Hostility and Harm on the Invader. For thus, as _Rage_ and _Despair_ increase, a Creature grows still more terrible; and being urg'd to the greatest extremity, finds a degree of Strength and Boldness unexperienc'd till then, and which had never risen, except thro' the height of Provocation. As to this Affection therefore, notwithstanding its immediate Aim be indeed _the Ill_ or Punishment _of another,_ yet it is plainly of the sort of those which tend to the Advantage and Interest of the Self-system, _the Animal himself;_ and is withal in other respects contributing to the Good and Interest of the Species. But there is hardly need we shou'd explain how mischievous and self-destructive ^Anger^ is, if it be what we commonly understand by that word: if it be such a Passion as is rash, and violent in the Instant of Provocation; or such as imprints it-self deeply, and causes a settled _Revenge,_ and an eager vindicative Pursuit. No wonder indeed that so much is done in mere _Revenge,_ and under the Weight of a deep _Resentment,_ when the Relief and Satisfaction found in that Indulgence is no other than the assuaging of the most torturous Pain, and the alleviating the most weighty and pressing Sensation of Misery. The Pain of this sort being for a-while remov'd or alleviated, by the accomplishment of the Desire, in the Ill of another, leaves indeed behind it the perception of a delicious Ease, and an overflowing of soft and pleasing Sensation. Yet is this, in truth, no better than the _Rack_ it-self. For whoever has experienc'd racking Pains, can tell in what manner a sudden Cessation or Respite is us'd to affect him. From hence are those untoward Delights of Perverseness, Frowardness, and an envenom'd malignant Disposition, acting at its liberty. For this is only _a perpetual assuaging of_ ^Anger^ _perpetually renew'd._ In other Characters, the _Passion_ arises not so suddenly, or on slight Causes; but being once mov'd, is not so easily quieted. The dormant _Fury,_ ^Revenge^, being rais'd once, and wrought up to her highest pitch, rests not till she attains her End; and, that attain'd, is easy, and reposes; making our succeeding Relief and Ease so much the more enjoy'd, as our preceding Anguish and incumbent Pain was of long duration, and bitter sense. Certainly if among _Lovers,_ and in the Language of Gallantry, the Success of ardent Love is call'd the _assuaging of a Pain;_ this other Success may be far more justly term'd so. However soft or flattering the former Pain may be esteem'd, this latter surely can be _no pleasing one:_ Nor can it be possibly esteem'd other than sound and thorow Wretchedness, a grating and disgustful Feeling, without the least mixture of any thing soft, gentle, or agreeable.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not very necessary to mention the ill effects of this Passion, in respect of our _Minds,_ or _Bodys,_ our private Condition, or _Circumstances_ of Life.

Now the Satisfactions of the _natural Appetite,_ in a plain way, are infinitely beyond those Indulgences of the most refin'd and elegant _Luxury._ This is often perceiv'd by the Luxurious them-selves. It has been experienc'd in People bred after the sumptuous way, and us'd never to wait, but to prevent Appetite; that when by any new Turn of Life they came to fall into a more natural Course, or for a while, as on a Journy, or a day of Sport, came accidentally to experience the Sweet of a plain Diet, recommended by due Abstinence and Exercise; they have with freedom own'd, that it was then they receiv'd the highest Satisfaction and Delight which _a Table_ cou'd possibly afford.","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the other side, it has been as often remark'd in Persons accustom'd to an active Life, and healthful Exercise; that having once thorowly experienc'd this plainer and more natural Diet, they have upon a following Change of Life regretted their Loss, and undervalu'd the Pleasures receiv'd from all the Delicacys of _Luxury,_ in comparison with those remember'd Satisfactions of a preceding State.

And tho thro' Vice or ill Habit the same Subjects of Appetite may, every day, be sought with greater Ardour; they are enjoy'd with less Satisfaction. Tho the Impatience of abstaining be greater; the Pleasure of Indulgence is really less. The _Palls_ or _Nauseatings_ which continually intervene, are of the worst and most hateful kind of Sensation. Hardly is there any thing tasted which is wholly free from this ill relish of a surfeited Sense and ruin'd Appetite.
