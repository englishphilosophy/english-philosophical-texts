To stand thus well affected, and to have one's Affections _right_ and _intire,_ not only in respect of one's self, but of Society and the Publick: This is _Rectitude, Integrity,_ or ^Virtue^. And to be wanting in any of these, or to have their Contrarys, is _Depravity, Corruption,_ and ^Vice^.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Difficulty stated._# It has been already shewn, that in the Passions and Affections of particular Creatures, there is a constant relation to the Interest of _a Species,_ or _common Nature._ This has been demonstrated in the case of _natural Affection,_ parental Kindness, Zeal for Posterity, Concern for the Propagation and Nurture of the Young, Love of Fellowship and Company, Compassion, mutual Succour, and the rest of this kind. Nor will any-one deny that this Affection of a Creature towards the Good of the Species or common Nature, is as _proper_ and _natural_ to him, as it is to any Organ, Part or Member of an Animal-Body, or mere Vegetable, to work in its known Course, and regular way of Growth. 'Tis not more _natural_ for the Stomach to digest, the Lungs to breathe, the Glands to separate Juices, or other Intrails to perform their several Offices; however they may by particular Impediments be sometimes disorder'd, or obstructed in their Operations.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There being allow'd therefore in a Creature such Affections as these towards _the common Nature,_ #_Union with a Kind or Species._# or _System of the Kind,_ together with those other which regard _the private Nature,_ or _Self-system;_ it will appear that in following the _first_ of these Affections, the Creature must on many Occasions contradict and go against _the latter._ How else shou'd the Species be preserv'd? Or what wou'd signify that implanted _natural Affection,_ by which a Creature thro' so many Difficultys and Hazards preserves its Offspring, and supports its Kind?","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Opposition from Self-interest._# It may therefore be imagin'd, perhaps, that there is a plain and absolute Opposition between these _two_ Habits or Affections. It may be presum'd, that the pursuing the common Interest or publick Good thro' the Affections of _one kind,_ must be a hindrance to the Attainment of private Good thro' the Affections of _another._ For it being taken for granted, that Hazards and Hardships, of whatever sort, are naturally the _Ill_ of the private State; and it being certainly the Nature of those publick Affections to lead often to the greatest Hardships and Hazards of every kind; 'tis presently infer'd, \"That 'tis the Creature's Interest to be without any publick Affection whatsoever.\"","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This we know for certain; That all social Love, Friendship, Gratitude, or whatever else is of this generous kind, does by its nature take place of the self-interesting Passions, draws us out of our-selves, and makes us disregardful of our own Convenience and Safety. So that according to a known[n1] way of reasoning on _Self-interest,_ that which is of a social kind in us, shou'd of right be abolish'd. Thus Kindness of every sort, Indulgence, Tenderness, Compassion, and in short, all natural Affection shou'd be industriously suppress'd, and, as mere Folly, and Weakness of Nature, be resisted and overcome; that, by this means, there might be nothing remaining in us, which was contrary to a direct _Self-end;_ nothing which might stand in opposition to a steddy and deliberate Pursuit of the most narrowly confin'd _Self-interest._","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"According to this extraordinary Hypothesis, it must be taken for granted, \"That in the System of a Kind or Species, the Interest of _the private Nature_ is directly opposite to that of _the common one;_ the Interest of _Particulars_ directly opposite to that of _the Publick in general._\"—A strange Constitution! in which it must be confess'd there is much Disorder and Untowardness; unlike to what we observe elsewhere in Nature. As if in any vegetable or animal Body, the _Part_ or Member cou'd be suppos'd in a good and prosperous State _as to it-self,_ when under a contrary Disposition, and in an unnatural Growth or Habit _as to its_ ^Whole^.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Reconciliation._# Now that this is in reality quite otherwise, we shall endeavour to demonstrate; so as to make appear, \"That what Men represent as an ill Order and Constitution in the Universe, by making moral Rectitude appear _the Ill,_ and Depravity _the Good_ or Advantage of a Creature, is in Nature just the contrary.
