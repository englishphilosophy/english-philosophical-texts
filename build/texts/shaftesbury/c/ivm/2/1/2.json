'Tis generally thought, that such a Creature as this, feels slender Joy in Life, and finds little Satisfaction in the mere sensual Pleasures which remain with him, after the Loss of social Enjoyment, and whatever can be call'd _Humanity_ or _Good-nature._ We know that to such a Creature as this, 'tis not only _incident,_ to be morose, rancorous and malignant; #_Dissolute or immoral State._# but that, _of necessity,_ a Mind or Temper thus destitute of Mildness and Benignity, must turn to that which is contrary, and be wrought by Passions of a different kind. Such a Heart as this must be a continual Seat of perverse Inclinations and bitter Aversions, rais'd from a constant ill Humour, Sourness, and Disquiet. The Consciousness of such a Nature, so obnoxious to Mankind, and to all Beings which approach it, must overcloud the Mind with dark Suspicion and Jealousy, alarm it with Fears and Horror, and raise in it a continual Disturbance, even in the most seeming fair and secure State of Fortune, and in the highest degree of outward Prosperity.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_In whole._# This, as to the _compleat_ immoral State, is what, of their own accord, Men readily remark. Where there is this _absolute_ Degeneracy, this _total_ Apostacy from all Candour, Equity, Trust, Sociableness, or Friendship; there are few who do not see and acknowledg the Misery which is consequent. Seldom is the Case misconstru'd, when _at worst._ The misfortune is, we look not on this Depravity, #_In part._# nor consider how it stands, _in less degrees._ The Calamity, we think, does not of necessity hold proportion with the Injustice or Iniquity. As if to be _absolutely_ immoral and inhuman, were indeed the greatest misfortune and misery; but that to be so, in _a little degree,_ shou'd be no misery nor harm at all! Which to allow, is just as reasonable as to own, that 'tis the greatest Ill of a Body to be in the utmost manner distorted and maim'd; but that to lose the use only of _one_ Limb, or to be impair'd in some _one single_ Organ or Member, is no Inconvenience or Ill worthy the least notice.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Inward Proportion._# The Parts and Proportions of _the Mind,_ their mutual Relation and Dependency, the Connexion and Frame of those Passions which constitute the Soul or Temper, may easily be understood by any-one who thinks it worth his while to study this inward Anatomy. 'Tis certain that the Order or Symmetry of this _inward Part_ is, in it-self, no less real and exact, than that of the _Body._ However, 'tis apparent that few of us endeavour to become _Anatomists_ of this sort. Nor is any-one asham'd of the deepest Ignorance in such a Subject. For tho the greatest Misery and Ill is generally own'd to be from _Disposition,_ and _Temper;_ tho 'tis allow'd that _Temper_ may often change, and that it actually varys on many occasions, much to our disadvantage; yet how this Matter is brought about, we inquire not. We never trouble our-selves to consider thorowly by what means or methods our _inward Constitution_ comes at any time to be impair'd or injur'd. The _Solutio Continui,_ #_Continuity._# which bodily Surgeons talk of, is never apply'd in this case, by Surgeons of another sort. The Notion of _a Whole_ and _Parts_ is not apprehended in this Science. We know not what the effect is, of straining any Affection, indulging any wrong Passion, or relaxing any proper and natural Habit, or good Inclination. Nor can we conceive how a particular Action shou'd have such a sudden Influence on the whole Mind, as to make the Person an immediate Sufferer. We suppose rather that a Man may violate his Faith, commit any Wickedness unfamiliar to him before, engage in any Vice or Villany, without the least prejudice to _himself,_ or any Misery _naturally_ following from the ill Action.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis thus we hear it often said, \"Such a Person has done ill indeed: But what is he the worse for it?\" Yet speaking of any Nature thorowly savage, curst, and inveterate, we say truly, \"Such a one is a plague and torment to himself\": And we allow, \"That thro' certain _Humours,_ or _Passions,_ and from _Temper_ merely, a Man may be compleately miserable; let his outward _Circumstances_ be ever so fortunate.\" These different Judgments sufficiently demonstrate that we are not accustom'd to think with much coherency on these moral Subjects; and that our Notions, in this respect, are not a little confus'd, and contradictory.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Fabrick or System of the Affections._# Now if the Fabrick of the Mind or Temper appear'd such to us as it really is; if we saw it impossible to remove hence any one good or orderly Affection, or introduce any ill or disorderly one, without drawing on, _in some degree,_ that dissolute State, which _at its height_ is confess'd to be so miserable: 'twou'd then undoubtedly be own'd, that since no ill, immoral, or unjust Action cou'd be committed without either a new inroad and breach on the Temper and Passions, or a farther advancing of that Execution already begun; whoever did ill, or acted in prejudice of his Integrity, Good-nature, or Worth, wou'd of necessity act with greater Cruelty towards himself, than he who scrupled not to swallow what was poisonous, or who with his own hands shou'd voluntarily mangle or wound his outward Form or Constitution, natural Limbs or Body.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.2.5"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Shaftesbury","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Lord Shaftesbury","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":1699,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LMU","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Several Letters Written by a Noble Lord to a Young Man at the University","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1716],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LM","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"The Late Earl of Shaftesbury's Letters to the Right Honourable the Lord Molesworth","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1721],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM","imported":true,"title":"An Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Merit","breadcrumb":"Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Merit","published":[1699]},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2","imported":true,"title":"Book II","breadcrumb":"Book 2","published":[1699]},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1","imported":true,"title":"Part 1","breadcrumb":"Part 1","published":[1699]}],"prev":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.1","imported":true,"title":"Section I","breadcrumb":"Section 1","published":[1699]},"next":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.1.3","imported":true,"title":"Section III","breadcrumb":"Section 3","published":[1699]}}
