So that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind of Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been already felt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or Dislike.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Case is the same in _mental_ or _moral_ Subjects, as in ordinary _Bodys,_ or the common Subjects of _Sense._ The Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of these latter being presented to our Eye; there necessarily results a[n1] Beauty or Deformity, according to the different Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts. So in _Behaviour_ and _Actions,_ when presented to our Understanding, there must be found, of necessity, an apparent Difference, according to the Regularity or Irregularity of the Subjects.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Moral Beauty and Deformity.# The Mind, which is Spectator or Auditor of _other Minds,_ cannot be without its _Eye_ and _Ear;_ so as to discern Proportion, distinguish Sound, and scan each Sentiment or Thought which comes before it. It can let nothing escape its Censure. It feels the Soft and Harsh, the Agreeable and Disagreeable, in the Affections; and finds a _Foul_ and _Fair,_ a _Harmonious_ and a _Dissonant,_ as really and truly here, as in any musical Numbers, or in the outward Forms or Representations of sensible Things. Nor can it[n2] with-hold its _Admiration_ and _Extasy,_ its _Aversion_ and _Scorn,_ any more in what relates to one than to the other of these Subjects. So that to deny the common and natural Sense of a ^Sublime^ and ^Beautiful^ in Things, will appear an[n3] Affectation merely, to any-one who considers duly of this Affair.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now as in the _sensible_ kind of Objects, the Species or Images of Bodys, Colours, and Sounds, are perpetually moving before our Eyes, and acting on our Senses, even when we sleep; so in the _moral_ and _intellectual_ kind, the Forms and Images of Things are no less active and incumbent on the Mind, at all Seasons, and even when the real Objects themselves are absent.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In these vagrant Characters or Pictures of _Manners,_ which the Mind of necessity figures to it-self, and carrys still about with it, the Heart cannot possibly remain neutral; but constantly takes part one way or other. However false or corrupt it be within it-self, it finds the difference, as to Beauty and Comeliness, between one _Heart_ and another, one _Turn of Affection,_ one _Behaviour,_ one _Sentiment_ and another; and accordingly, in all disinterested Cases, must approve in some measure of what is natural and honest, and disapprove what is dishonest and corrupt.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus the several Motions, Inclinations, Passions, Dispositions, and consequent Carriage and Behaviour of Creatures in the various Parts of Life, being in several Views or Perspectives represented to the Mind, which readily discerns the Good and Ill towards the Species or Publick; there arises a new Trial or Exercise of the Heart: which must either rightly and soundly affect what is just and right, and disaffect what is contrary; or, corruptly affect what is ill, and disaffect, what is worthy and good.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Publick Good an Object.# And in this Case alone it is we call any Creature _worthy_ or _virtuous,_ when it can have the Notion of a publick Interest, and can attain the Speculation or Science of what is morally good or ill, admirable or blameable, right or wrong. For tho we may vulgarly call an ill Horse _vitious,_ yet we never say of a good one, nor of any mere Beast, Idiot, or Changeling, tho ever so good-natur'd, that he is _worthy_ or _virtuous._","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So that if a Creature be generous, kind, constant, compassionate; yet if he cannot reflect on what he himself does, or sees others do, so as to take notice of what is _worthy_ or _honest;_ and make that Notice or Conception of _Worth_ and _Honesty_ to be an Object of his Affection; he has not the Character of being _virtuous:_ #GOODNESS and VIRTUE.# for thus, and no otherwise, he is capable of having a _Sense of Right or Wrong;_ a Sentiment or Judgment of what is done, thro' just, equal, and good Affection, or the contrary.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Unequal Affection, or Iniquity.# Whatsoever is done thro' any unequal Affection, is _iniquous, wicked,_ and _wrong._ If the Affection be equal, found, and good, and the Subject of the Affection such as may with advantage to Society be ever in the same manner prosecuted, or affected; this must necessarily constitute what we call _Equity_ and _Right_ in any Action. For, ^Wrong^ is not such Action as is barely the Cause of Harm, (since at this rate a dutiful Son aiming at an Enemy, but by mistake or ill chance happening to kill his Father, wou'd do _a Wrong_) but when any thing is done thro' insufficient or unequal Affection, (as when a Son shews no Concern for the Safety of a Father; or, where there is need of Succour, prefers an indifferent Person to him) this is of the nature of _Wrong._","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Neither can any Weakness or Imperfection in the Senses be the occasion of _Iniquity_ or _Wrong;_ #Impair'd Sense.# if the Object of the Mind it-self be not at any time absurdly fram'd, nor any way improper, but sutable, just, and worthy of the Opinion and Affection apply'd to it. For if we will suppose a Man, who being sound and intire both in his Reason and Affection, has nevertheless so deprav'd a Constitution or Frame of Body, that the natural Objects are, thro' his Organs of Sense, as thro' ill Glasses, falsly convey'd and misrepresented; 'twill be soon observ'd, in such a Person's case, that since his Failure is not in his principal or leading Part; he cannot in himself be esteem'd _iniquous,_ or unjust.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Corrupt Opinion.# 'Tis otherwise in what relates to _Opinion,_ Belief, or Speculation. For as the Extravagance of Judgment or Belief is such, that in some Countrys even Monkeys, Cats, Crocodiles, and other vile or destructive Animals, have been esteem'd _holy,_ and worship'd even as _Deitys;_ shou'd it appear to any-one of the Religion or Belief of those Countrys, that to save such a Creature as a Cat, preferably to a Parent, was _Right;_ and that other Men, who had not the same religious Opinion, were to be treated as Enemys, till converted; this wou'd be certainly _Wrong,_ and wicked in the Believer: and every Action, grounded on this Belief, wou'd be an _iniquous,_ wicked, and vitious Action.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Right and Wrong.# And thus whatsoever causes a Misconception or Misapprehension of the Worth or Value of any Object, so as to diminish a due, or raise any undue, irregular, or unsocial Affection, must necessarily be the occasion of _Wrong._ Thus he who affects or loves a Man for the sake of something which is reputed honourable, but which is in reality vitious, is himself vitious and ill. The beginnings of this Corruption may be noted in many Occurrences: As when an ambitious Man, by the Fame of his high Attempts, a Conqueror or a Pirate by his boasted Enterprizes, raises in another Person an Esteem and Admiration of that immoral and inhuman Character, which deserves Abhorrence: 'tis then that the Hearer becomes corrupt, when he secretly approves the Ill he hears. But on the other side, the Man who loves and esteems another, as believing him to have that Virtue which he has not, but only counterfeits, is not on this account either vitious or corrupt.","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Mistake therefore _in Fact_ being no Cause or Sign of ill Affection, can be no Cause of Vice.

For such a Principle as this must be wholly vitious: and whatsoever is acted upon it, can be no other than Vice and Immorality. #Vitious Worship.# And thus if there be any thing which teaches Men either Treachery, Ingratitude, or Cruelty, by divine Warrant; or under colour and pretence of any present or future Good to Mankind: if there be any thing which teaches Men to[n4] persecute their Friends thro' Love; or to torment Captives of War in sport; or to offer[n5] human Sacrifice; or to torment, macerate, or mangle themselves, in a religious Zeal, before their God; or to commit any sort of Barbarity, or Brutality, as amiable or becoming: be it Custom which gives Applause, or Religion which gives a Sanction; this is not, nor ever can be _Virtue_ of any kind, or in any sense; but must remain still horrid Depravity, #Vitious Custom.# notwithstanding any Fashion, Law, Custom, or Religion; which may be ill and vitious _it-self,_ but can never alter the _eternal Measures,_ and immutable independent Nature of _Worth_ and ^Virtue^.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.16"},{"type":"note","content":"_Infra,_ pag. 414.","subId":"n1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.n1"},{"type":"note","content":"_Infra,_ pag. 415, 418, 419, &c.","subId":"n2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.3.n2"},{"type":"note","content":"VOL.
