But if the Affection be then only injurious to the Society, when it is immoderate, and not so when it is moderate, duly temper'd, and allay'd; then is _the immoderate_ degree of the Affection truly vitious, but not _the moderate._ And thus, if there be found in any Creature a more than ordinary Self-concernment, or Regard to private Good, which is inconsistent with the Interest of the Species or Publick; this must in every respect be esteem'd an ill and vitious Affection. And this is what we commonly call[n2] ^Selfishness^, and disapprove so much, in whatever Creature we happen to discover it.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the other side, if the Affection towards private or Self-good, however _selfish_ it may be esteem'd, is in reality not only consistent with publick Good, but in some measure contributing to it; if it be such, perhaps, as for the good of the Species in general, every Individual ought to share; 'tis so far from being ill, or blameable in any sense, that it must be acknowledg'd absolutely necessary to constitute a Creature _Good._ For if the want of such an Affection as that towards Self-preservation, be injurious to the Species; a Creature is ill and unnatural as well thro' this Defect, as thro' the want of any other natural Affection. And this no-one wou'd doubt to pronounce, if he saw a Man who minded not any Precipices which lay in his way, nor made any distinction of Food, Diet, Clothing, or whatever else related to his Health and Being. The same wou'd be aver'd of one who had a Disposition which render'd him averse to any Commerce with Womankind, and of consequence unfitted him thro' _Illness of Temper_ (and not merely thro' _a Defect of Constitution_) for the propagation of his Species or Kind.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus the Affection towards Self-good, may be a good Affection, or an ill-one. For if this private Affection be too strong, (as when the _excessive Love of Life_ unfits a Creature for any generous Act) then is it undoubtedly vitious; and if vitious, the Creature who is mov'd by it, is vitiously mov'd, and can never be otherwise than vitious in some degree, when mov'd by that Affection. Therefore if thro' such an earnest and passionate _Love of Life,_ a Creature be accidentally induc'd to do Good, (as he might be upon the same terms induc'd to do ^Ill^) he is no more a good Creature for this Good he executes, than a Man is the more an honest or good Man either for pleading a just Cause, or fighting in a good one, for the sake merely of his Fee or Stipend.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whatsoever therefore is done which happens to be advantageous to the Species, thro' an Affection merely towards Self-good, does not imply any more Goodness in the Creature than as the Affection it-self is good. Let him, in any particular, act ever so well; if at the bottom, it be that selfish Affection alone which moves him; he is in himself still vitious. Nor can any Creature be consider'd otherwise, when the Passion towards Self-good, tho ever so moderate, is his real Motive in the doing that, to which a natural Affection for his Kind ought by right to have inclin'd him.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Temper.# And indeed whatever exterior Helps or Succours an ill-dispos'd Creature may find, to push him on towards the performance of any one good Action; there can no Goodness arise in him, till his _Temper_ be so far chang'd, that in the issue he comes in earnest to be led by some immediate Affection, _directly,_ and not _accidentally,_ to Good, and against Ill.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For instance; if one of those Creatures suppos'd to be by Nature tame, gentle, and favourable to Mankind, be, contrary to his natural Constitution, fierce and savage; we instantly remark the Breach of _Temper,_ and own the Creature to be unnatural and corrupt. If at any time afterwards, the same Creature, by good Fortune or right Management, comes to lose his Fierceness, and is made tame, gentle, and treatable, like other Creatures of his Kind; 'tis acknowledg'd that the Creature thus restor'd becomes good and natural. Suppose, now, that the Creature has indeed a tame and gentle Carriage; but that it proceeds only from _the fear of his Keeper;_ which if set aside, his predominant Passion instantly breaks out: then is his Gentleness not his real Temper; but, his true and genuine _Nature_ or _natural Temper_ remaining just as it was, the Creature is still as _ill_ as ever.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nothing therefore being properly either Goodness or Illness in a Creature, except what is from _natural Temper;_ \"A good Creature is such a one as by the natural Temper or Bent of his Affections is carry'd _primarily and immediately,_ and not _secondarily and accidentally,_ to Good, and against Ill\": And an _ill Creature_ is just the contrary; _viz._ \"One who is wanting in right Affections, of force enough to carry him _directly_ towards Good, and bear him out against Ill; or who is carry'd by other Affections directly to Ill, and against Good.\"","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When in general, all the Affections or Passions are suted to the publick Good, or good of the Species, as above-mention'd; then is the _natural Temper_ intirely good. If, on the contrary, any requisite Passion be wanting; or if there be any one supernumerary, or weak, or any-wise disserviceable, or contrary to that main End; then is the natural Temper, and consequently the Creature himself, in some measure corrupt and _ill._","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THERE is no need of mentioning either _Envy, Malice, Frowardness,_ or other such hateful Passions; to shew in what manner they are ill, and constitute an _ill_ Creature. But it may be necessary perhaps to remark, that even as to _Kindness_ and _Love_ of the most natural sort, (such as that of any Creature for its Offspring) if it be immoderate and beyond a certain degree, it is undoubtedly vitious. For thus over-great _Tenderness_ destroys the Effect of Love, and excessive _Pity_ renders us uncapable of giving succour. Hence the Excess of motherly Love is own'd to be a _vitious Fondness;_ over-great Pity, _Effeminacy and Weakness;_ over-great Concern for Self-preservation, _Meanness and Cowardice;_ too little, _Rashness;_ and none at all, or that which is contrary, (_viz._ a Passion leading to Self-destruction) a _mad_ and _desperate Depravity._","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.10"},{"type":"note","content":"_Infra, pag._ 79, &c. 163, 4, &c.","subId":"n1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.n1"},{"type":"note","content":"VOL.
