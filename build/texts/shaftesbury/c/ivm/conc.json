We have cast up all those Particulars, from whence (as by way of Addition and Subtraction) the main _Sum_ or general Account of Happiness, is either augmented or diminish'd. And if there be no Article exceptionable in this Scheme of _Moral Arithmetick;_ the Subject treated may be said to have an Evidence as great as that which is found in Numbers, or Mathematicks. For let us carry _Scepticism_ ever so far, let us doubt, if we can, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes _within our-selves._ Our Passions and Affections are known to us. _They_ are certain, whatever the _Objects_ may be, on which they are employ'd. Nor is it of any concern to our Argument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are Realitys, or mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For _ill Dreams_ will be equally disturbing. And a good _Dream,_ if Life be nothing else, will be easily and happily pass'd. In this Dream of Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our _Balance_ and _OEconomy_ hold good, and our Obligation to ^Virtue^ is in every respect the same.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon the whole: There is not, I presume, the least degree of Certainty wanting in what has been said concerning the Preferableness of _the mental Pleasures to the_ _sensual;_ and even _of the sensual, accompany'd with good Affection, and under a temperate and right use,_ to those which are _no ways restrain'd, nor supported by any thing social or affectionate._","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor is there less Evidence in what has been said, of _the united Structure and Fabrick of the Mind,_ and of those Passions which constitute _the Temper,_ or Soul; and on which its Happiness or Misery so immediately depend. It has been shewn, That in _this Constitution,_ the impairing of any one Part must instantly tend to the disorder and ruin of other Parts, and of the Whole it-self; thro' the necessary _Connexion_ and _Balance_ of the Affections: That those very Passions thro' which Men are vitious, are of themselves a Torment and Disease; and that whatsoever is done which is knowingly _ill,_ must be of _ill Consciousness;_ and in proportion, as the Act is ill, must impair and corrupt social Enjoyment, and destroy both _the Capacity of kind Affection, and the Consciousness of meriting any such._ So that neither can we _participate_ thus in Joy or Happiness with others, or receive Satisfaction _from the mutual Kindness or imagin'd Love of others:_ on which, however, the greatest of all our Pleasures are founded.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If this be the Case of moral Delinquency; and if the State which is consequent to this _Defection_ from Nature, be of all other the most horrid, oppressive, and miserable; 'twill appear, \"_That to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral, is a Breach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills_\": and, \"That on the other side, _Every thing which is an Improvement of Virtue, or an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an Advancement of Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid Happiness and Enjoyment._\"","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus the Wisdom of what rules, and is ^first^ and ^chief^ _in Nature,_ has made it to be according to the _private Interest_ and _Good_ of every-one, to work towards the _general Good;_ which if a Creature ceases to promote, he is actually so far wanting to himself, and ceases to promote his own Happiness and Welfare. He is, on this account, directly his own Enemy: Nor can he any otherwise be good or useful to himself, than as he continues good to Society, and to that _Whole_ of which he is himself _a Part._ So that ^Virtue^, which of all Excellencys and Beautys is the chief, and most amiable; _that_ which is the Prop and Ornament of human Affairs; which upholds Communitys, maintains Union, Friendship, and Correspondence amongst Men; _that_ by which Countrys, as well as private Familys, flourish and are happy; and for want of which, every-thing comely, conspicuous, great and worthy, must perish, and go to ruin; _that single Quality,_ thus beneficial to all Society, and to Mankind _in general,_ is found equally a Happiness and Good to each Creature _in particular;_ and is _that_ by which alone Man can be happy, and without which he must be miserable.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And, thus, ^Virtue^ is _the Good,_ and ^Vice^ _the Ill_ of every-one.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.9"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Shaftesbury","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Lord Shaftesbury","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":1699,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LMU","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Several Letters Written by a Noble Lord to a Young Man at the University","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1716],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LM","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"The Late Earl of Shaftesbury's Letters to the Right Honourable the Lord Molesworth","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1721],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM","imported":true,"title":"An Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Merit","breadcrumb":"Inquiry Concerning Virtue or Merit","published":[1699]}],"prev":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2","imported":true,"title":"Book II","breadcrumb":"Book 2","published":[1699]},"next":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.M","imported":true,"title":"The Moralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody","breadcrumb":"The Moralists","published":[1709]}}
