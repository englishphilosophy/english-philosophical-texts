After which, in the succeeding Page, he sums up his Sense on this Subject of sacred Literature, and the Liberty of Criticism, and of private Judgment and Opinion in these Matters, in the following words: \"Since there are so many Copys, with infinite Varietys of Reading; since a various Interpunction, a Parenthesis, a Letter, an Accent may much alter the Sense; since some Places have divers literal Senses, many have spiritual, mystical, and allegorical Meanings; since there are so many Tropes, Metonymys, Ironys, Hyperboles, Proprietys and Improprietys of Language, whose understanding depends upon such Circumstances, that it is almost impossible to know the proper Interpretation, now that the knowledg of such Circumstances and particular Storys is irrecoverably lost: since there are some Mysterys, which at the best Advantage of Expression, are not easy to be apprehended, and whose Explication, by reason of our Imperfections, must needs be dark, sometimes weak, sometimes unintelligible: And lastly, since those ordinary means of expounding Scripture, as searching the Originals, Conference of Places, Parity of Reason, and Analogy of Faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible; he that is the wisest, and by consequence the likeliest to expound truest, in all probability of Reason, will be very far from Confidence; because every one of these, and many more, are like so many degrees of Improbability and Incertainty, all depressing our Certainty of finding out Truth, in such Mysterys, and amidst so many Difficultys. And therefore a wise Man that considers this, wou'd not willingly be prescrib'd to by others; for it is best every Man shou'd be left in that liberty, from which no Man can justly take him, unless he cou'd secure him from Error.\" The Reverend Prelate had but a few Pages before (_viz. pag._ 427.) acknowledg'd, indeed, \"That we had an Apostolical Warrant to _contend earnestly for the Faith._\" But then, (says the good Bishop, very candidly and ingenuously) \"As these Things recede farther from the Foundation, our Certainty is the less.—And therefore it were very fit that our _Confidence_ shou'd be according to our _Evidence,_ and our _Zeal_ according to our _Confidence._\" He adds, _pag._ 507. \"All these Disputes concerning Tradition, Councils, Fathers, _&c._ are not Arguments against or besides Reason, but Contestations and Pretenses of the best Arguments, and the most certain Satisfaction of our Reason. But then all these coming into question, submit themselves to Reason, that is, to be judg'd by human Understanding, upon the best Grounds and Information it can receive. So that Scripture, Tradition, Councils, and Fathers, are the Evidence in a Question, but Reason is the Judg: That is, we being the Persons that are to be persuaded, we must see that we be persuaded reasonably; and it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser Evidence, when a greater and clearer is propounded: but of that every Man for himself is to take cognizance, if he be able to judg; if he be not, he is not bound under the tie of necessity to know any thing of it.\"","subId":"n16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.3.n16"},{"type":"note","content":"_Viz._ Archbishop ^Tillotson^ in his _Rule of Faith,_ pag. 677.","subId":"n17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.3.n17"},{"type":"note","content":"His Grace subjoins immediately: \"The Traditionary Church _now,_ receives the Epistle to the _Hebrews_ as Canonical.
