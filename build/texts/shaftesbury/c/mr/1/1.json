'Tis well known to the able Practitioners in _the writing Art;_ \"That as easy as it is _to conceive Wit,_ 'tis the hardest thing imaginable _to be deliver'd_ of It, upon certain Terms.\" Nothing cou'd be more severe or rigid than the Conditions formerly prescrib'd to Writers; when ^Criticism^ took place, and _Regularity_ and _Order_ were thought essential in a Treatise. The Notion of a _genuine Work,_ a _legitimate_ and _just Piece,_ has certainly been the Occasion of great Timidity and Backwardness among the Adventurers in Wit: And the Imposition of such strict _Laws_ and _Rules_ of Composition, has set heavy on the free Spirits and forward Genius's of Mankind. 'Twas _a Yoke,_ it seems, which our Forefathers bore; but which, for our parts, we have generously thrown off. In effect, the invidious Distinctions of _Bastardy_ and _Legitimacy_ being at length remov'd; the natural and lawful Issue of the Brain comes with like advantage into the World: And _Wit_ (_mere_ ^Wit^) is well receiv'd; without examination of _the Kind,_ or censure of _the Form._","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This the ^Miscellaneous^ _Manner_ of Writing, it must be own'd, has happily effected. It has render'd almost every Soil productive. It has disclos'd those various _Seeds_ of Wit, which lay suppress'd in many a Bosom; and has rear'd numberless _Conceits_ and curious _Fancys,_ which the natural Rudeness and Asperity of their native Soil wou'd have with-held, or at least not have permitted to rise above the ground. From every _Field,_ from every _Hedge_ or _Hillock,_ we now gather as delicious Fruits and fragrant Flowers, as of old from the richest and best-cultivated _Gardens._ Miserable were those antient Planters, who understanding not how to conform themselves to the rude _Taste_ of unpolish'd Mankind, made it so difficult a Task to serve the World with _intellectual_ Entertainments, and furnish out the Repasts of _Literature_ and _Science._","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There was certainly a time when the Name of ^Author^ stood for something considerable in the World. To succeed happily in such a Labour as that of writing _a Treatise_ or _a Poem,_ was taken as a sure mark of Understanding and Good Sense. The Task was painful: But, it seems, 'twas honourable. How the Case happen'd, in process of time, to be so much revers'd, is hard to say. The primitive Authors perhaps being few in number, and highly respected for their Art, fell under the weight of _Envy._ Being sensible of their Misfortune in this respect, and being excited, as 'tis probable, by the Example of some popular Genius; they quitted their regular Schemes and accurate Forms of Workmanship, in favour of those _Wits_ who could not possibly be receiv'd as ^Authors^ upon such difficult Terms. 'Twas necessary, it seems, that _the Bottom_ of Wit shou'd be enlarg'd. 'Twas advisable that more Hands shou'd be taken into the Work. And nothing cou'd better serve this popular purpose, than the way of ^Miscellany^, or _common_ ^Essay^; in which the most confus'd Head, if fraught with a little Invention, and provided with _Common-place-Book_ Learning, might exert itself to as much advantage, as the most orderly and well-settled Judgment.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To explain the better how this Revolution in Letters has been effected, it may not perhaps be indecent, shou'd we offer to compare our Writing-Artists, to the _Manufacturers_ in _Stuff_ or _Silk._ For among These 'tis esteem'd a principal piece of Skill, to frame a Pattern, or Plan of Workmanship, in which the several Colours are agreeably dispos'd; with such proportionable Adjustment of the various Figures and Devices, as may, in the whole, create a kind of _Harmony_ to the Eye. According to this Method, each _Piece_ must be, in reality, _an Original._ For to copy what has gone before, can be of no use. The Fraud wou'd easily be perceiv'd. On the other side, to work _originally,_ and in a manner _create_ each time anew, must be a matter of pressing weight, and fitted to the Strength and Capacity of none besides the choicest Workmen.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Manner therefore is invented to confound this Simplicity and Conformity of Design. _Patch-work_ is substituted. _Cuttings_ and _Shreds_ of Learning, with various _Fragments,_ and _Points_ of Wit, are drawn together, and tack'd in any fantastick form. If they chance to cast a _Luster,_ and spread a sort of sprightly _Glare;_ the ^Miscellany^ is approv'd, and the _complex_ Form and Texture of the Work admir'd. The ^Eye^, which before was to be won by Regularity, and had kept true to Measure and strict Proportion, is by this means pleasingly drawn aside, to commit a kind of _Debauch,_ and amuse it-self in gaudy Colours, and disfigur'd Shapes of things. Custom, in the mean while, has not only tolerated this Licentiousness, but render'd it even commendable, and brought it into the highest repute. The _Wild_ and _Whimsical,_ under the name of the _Odd_ and _Pretty,_ succeed in the room of the _Graceful_ and the _Beautiful._ Justness and Accuracy of Thought are set aside, as too constraining, and of too painful an aspect, to be endur'd in the agreeable and more easy Commerce of _Gallantry,_ and modern _Wit._","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now since it has been thought convenient, in these latter Ages, to distinguish the Provinces of ^Wit^ and ^Wisdom^, and set apart _the agreeable_ from _the useful;_ 'tis evident there cou'd be nothing devis'd more sutable to the distinct and separate Interest of the former of these Provinces, than this _complex_ manner of Performance which we call ^Miscellany^. For whatever is _capricious_ and _odd,_ is sure to create _Diversion,_ to those who look no further. And where there is nothing like _Nature,_ there is no room for the troublesom part of _Thought_ or _Contemplation._ 'Tis the Perfection of certain _Grotesque_-Painters, to keep as far from Nature as possible. To find _a Likeness_ in their Works, is to find the greatest Fault imaginable. A natural _Connexion_ is a Slur. A _Coherence,_ a _Design,_ a _Meaning,_ is against their purpose, and destroys the very Spirit and Genius of their Workmanship.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I remember formerly when I was a Spectator in the _French_ Theater, I found it the Custom, at the end of every grave and solemn _Tragedy,_ to introduce a comick _Farce,_ or ^Miscellany^, which they call'd _the little Piece._ We have indeed a Method still more extraordinary upon our own Stage. For we think it agreeable and just, to mix the _Little Piece_ or _Farce_ with the main Plot or Fable, thro' every Act. This perhaps may be the rather chosen, because our Tragedy is so much _deeper_ and _bloodier_ than that of the _French,_ and therefore needs more immediate Refreshment from the elegant way of _Drollery,_ and _Burlesque-wit;_ which being thus closely interwoven with its opposite, makes that most accomplish'd kind of _theatrical_ ^Miscellany^, call'd by our Poets _a Tragi-comedy._","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I cou'd go further perhaps, and demonstrate from the Writings of many of our grave _Divines,_ the Speeches of our _Senators,_ and other principal Models of our national Erudition, \"That the ^Miscellaneous^ _Manner_ is at present in the highest esteem.\" But since my chief Intention in the following Sheets is to descant cursorily upon some late Pieces of a _British_ Author; I will presume, That what I have said already on this Head is sufficient; and That it will not be judg'd improper or absurd in me, as I proceed, to take advantage of this _miscellaneous Taste_ which now evidently prevails. According to this Method, whilst I serve as _Critick_ or _Interpreter_ to this new Writer, I may the better correct his Flegm, and give him more of the fashionable Air and Manner of the World; especially in what relates to the Subject and Manner of his two _last_ Pieces, which are contain'd in his second Volume. For these being of the more regular and formal kind, may easily be oppressive to the airy Reader; and may therefore with the same assurance as _Tragedy_ claim the necessary Relief of the _little Piece_ or _Farce_ above-mention'd.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor ought the Title of a ^Miscellaneous^ _Writer_ to be deny'd me, on the account that I have grounded my _Miscellanys_ upon a certain Set of Treatises already publish'd. _Grounds_ and _Foundations_ are of no moment in a kind of Work, which, according to modern Establishment, has properly neither _Top_ nor _Bottom, Beginning_ nor _End._ Besides, that I shall no-way confine myself to the precise Contents of these Treatises; but, like my Fellow-_Miscellanarians,_ shall take occasion to vary often from my propos'd Subject, and make what _Deviations_ or _Excursions_ I shall think fit, as I proceed in my _random_ ^Essays^.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.1.9"}]}
