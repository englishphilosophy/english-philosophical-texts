See above, VOL. I. _pag._ 208, 336, &c. 340, 350, &c. And below, _pag._ 259, 260.","subId":"n6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.2.n6"},{"type":"note","content":"This is the HONESTUM, the PULCHRUM, τὸ καλόν [the Beautiful], on which our Author lays the stress of VIRTUE, and the Merits of this Cause; as well in his other Treatises, as in this of _Soliloquy_ here commented. This _Beauty_ the ^Roman^ _Orator,_ in his rhetorical way, and in the Majesty of Style, cou'd express no otherwise than as _A Mystery._ \"_HONESTUM igitur id intelligimus, quod tale est, ut, detractâ omni utilitate, sine ullis praemiis fructibusve, per seipsum possit jure laudari. Quod quale sit, non tam definitione quâ sum usus intelligi potest (quanquam aliquantum potest) quam COMMUNI omnium JUDICIO, & optimi cujusque studiis, atque factis a qui permulta ob eam unam causam faciunt, quia decet, quia rectum, quia honestum est; etsi nullum consecuturum emolumentum vident._\" [By _right_ therefore I understand what is such that, apart from expediency, without any reward or profit, it can properly be praised on its own account. What sort of thing, that is, may be understood, not so much from the definition I have given (though to some extent it may be so understood) as from the general agreement of all, and from the enthusiasm and acts of the best men; they do many a thing for this one reason, that it is becoming, is proper, is right, even though they see no gain likely to follow.] Our Author, on the other side, having little of the _Orator,_ and less of the Constraint of Formality belonging to some graver _Characters,_ can be more familiar on this occasion: and accordingly descending, without the least scruple, into whatever Style, or Humour; he refuses to make the least Difficulty or _Mystery_ of this matter. He pretends, on this head, to claim the Assent not only of _Orators, Poets,_ and the higher _Virtuosi,_ but even of the _Beaux_ themselves, and such as go no farther than the Dancing-Master to seek for _Grace_ and _Beauty._ He pretends, we see, to fetch this _natural Idea_ from as familiar Amusements as Dress, Equipage, the Tiring-Room, or Toy-shop. And thus in his proper manner of _SOLILOQUY,_ or _Self-Discourse,_ we may imagine him running on: beginning perhaps with some particular _Scheme_ or fansy'd _Scale_ of BEAUTY, which, according to his Philosophy, he strives to erect; by distinguishing, sorting, and dividing into Things _animate, in-animate,_ and _mixt:_ as thus.In the IN-ANIMATE; beginning from those _regular Figures_ and _Symmetrys_ with which Children are delighted; and proceeding gradually to the Proportions of _Architecture_ and the other _Arts._—The same in respect of _Sounds_ and MUSICK. From beautiful Stones, Rocks, _Minerals;_ to _Vegetables,_ Woods, aggregate Parts of the World, Seas, Rivers, Mountains, Vales.—The _Globe._—Celestial Bodys, and their Order. The higher _Architecture_ of Nature.—NATURE her-self, consider'd as _in-animate_ and _passive._In the ANIMATE; from _Animals,_ and their several Kinds, Tempers, Sagacitys, to _Men._—And from single _Persons_ of Men, their private _Characters,_ Understandings, _Genius's,_ Dispositions, Manners; to Publick Societys, _Communitys,_ or _Commonwealths._—From Flocks, Herds, and other natural _Assemblages_ or _Groups_ of living Creatures, to human Intelligencys and Correspondencys, or whatever is higher in the kind. The Correspondence, Union and Harmony of NATURE her-self, consider'd as _animate_ and intelligent.In the MIXT; as in a _single Person,_ (a Body and a Mind) the Union and Harmony of this kind, which constitutes the real _Person:_ and the Friendship, Love, or whatever other Affection is form'd on such an Object. A _Houshold,_ a _City,_ or _Nation,_ with certain Lands, Buildings, and other Appendices, or local Ornaments, which jointly form that agreeable Idea of _Home, Family, Country._—‘‘And what of this? (says an airy Spark, no Friend to Meditation or deep Thought) \"What means this _Catalogue,_ or _Scale,_ as you are pleas'd to call it?\" \"Only, Sir, to satisfy my-self, That I am not alone, or single in a certain Fancy I have of a thing call'd BEAUTY; That I have almost the whole World for my Companions; and That each of us _Admirers_ and earnest _Pursuers of_ BEAUTY (such as in a manner we _All_ are) if peradventure we take not a certain Sagacity along with us, we must err widely, range extravagantly, and run ever upon a false Scent. We may, in the Sportsman's Phrase, _have many Hares afoot,_ but shall stick to no real _Game,_ nor be fortunate in _any Capture_ which may content us.\"‘‘See with what Ardour and Vehemence, the young Man, neglecting his proper Race and Fellow-Creatures, and forgetting what is _decent, handsom,_ or _becoming_ in human Affairs, pursues these SPECIES in those common Objects of his Affection, a _Horse,_ a _Hound,_ a _Hawk!_—What doting on these _Beautys!_—What Admiration of the _Kind_ it-self! And of the particular _Animal,_ what Care, and in a manner Idolatry and Consecration; when the Beast beloved is (as often happens) even set apart from use, and only kept to gaze on, and feed the enamour'd Fancy with highest Delight!—See! in another Youth, not so forgetful of _Human Kind,_ but remembring it still in a wrong way! a φιλόκαλος [a lover of the beautiful] of another sort, a CHAEREA. _Quàm elegans formarum Spectator!_—See as to other _Beautys,_ where there is no Possession, no Enjoyment or Reward, but barely seeing and admiring: as in the _Virtuoso_-Passion, the Love of _Painting,_ and the _Designing_ Arts of every kind, so often observ'd.—How fares it with our _princely Genius,_ our _Grandee_ who assembles all these _Beautys,_ and within the Bounds of his sumptuous Palace incloses all these Graces of a thousand kinds?—What Pains! Study! Science!—Behold the Disposition and Order of these finer sorts of Apartments, Gardens, _Villas!_—The kind of Harmony to the Eye, from the various Shapes and Colours agreeably mixt, and rang'd in Lines, intercrossing without confusion, and fortunately co-incident.—A _Parterre,_ Cypresses, Groves, Wildernesses.—Statues, here and there, of _Virtue, Fortitude, Temperance._—_Heroes_-Busts, _Philosophers_-Heads; with sutable Mottos and Inscriptions.—Solemn Representations of things deeply natural.—_Caves, Grottos, Rocks._—_Urns_ and _Obelisks_ in retir'd places, and dispos'd at proper distances and points of Sight: with all those Symmetrys which silently express a reigning _Order, Peace, Harmony,_ and _Beauty!_—But what is there answerable to this, in the MINDS of _the Possessors?_—What _Possession_ or _Propriety_ is theirs? What _Constancy_ or _Security_ of Enjoyment? What _Peace,_ what _Harmony_ WITHIN.—Thus our MONOLOGIST, or _self-discoursing_ Author, in his usual Strain; when incited to the Search of BEAUTY and the DECORUM, by vulgar Admiration, and the universal Acknowledgment of the SPECIES in _outward_ Things, and in the _meaner_ and _subordinate_ Subjects. By this inferior _Species,_ it seems, our strict Inspector disdains to be allur'd: And refusing to be captivated by any thing less than the _superior, original,_ and _genuine_ Kind; he walks at leisure, without Emotion, in deep philosophical Reserve, thro' all these pompous Scenes; passes unconcernedly by those Court-Pageants, the illustrious and much-envy'd Potentates of the Place; overlooks _the Rich, the Great,_ and even _the Fair:_ feeling no other Astonishment than what is accidentally rais'd in him, by the View of these Impostures, and of this specious _Snare._ For here he observes those Gentlemen chiefly to be caught and fastest held, who are the highest Ridiculers of such Reflections as his own; and who in the very height of this Ridicule prove themselves the impotent Contemners of a SPECIES, which, whether they will or no, they ardently pursue: Some, in _a Face,_ and certain regular Lines, or Features: Others, in _a Palace and Apartments:_ Others, in _an Equipage_ and _Dress._—\"O EFFEMINACY! EFFEMINACY! Who wou'd imagine this cou'd be the _Vice_ of such as appear no inconsiderable Men?—But _Person_ is a Subject of Flattery which reaches beyond the Bloom of Youth. The experienc'd Senator and aged General, can, in our days, dispense with a _Toilet,_ and take his outward Form into a very extraordinary Adjustment and Regulation.—All _Embellishments_ are affected, besides the true. And thus, led by Example, whilst we run in search of _Elegancy_ and _Neatness;_ pursuing BEAUTY; and adding, as we imagine, more Lustre, and Value to our own _Person;_ we grow, in our real _Character_ and truer _SELF, deform'd_ and _monstrous, servile_ and _abject;_ stooping to the lowest Terms of Courtship; and sacrificing all internal Proportion, all _intrinsick_ and _real_ BEAUTY and WORTH, for the sake of Things which carry scarce a Shadow of the Kind.\" _Supra,_ VOL.
