We may find a thousand Engineers, who can _sap, undermine,_ and _blow up,_ with admirable Dexterity, for one single-one, who can _build_ a Fort, or lay the Plat-form of a Citadel.

It must be acknowledg'd, that tho, in the earliest times, there may have been _divine_ Men of a transcending Genius, who have given Laws both in Religion and Government, to the great Advantage and Improvement of Mankind; yet ^Philosophy^ it-self, as a _Science_ and known _Profession_ worthy of that name, cannot with any probability be suppos'd to have risen (as our Author shews) till other _Arts_ had been rais'd, and, in a certain proportion, advanc'd before it. As this was of the greatest Dignity and Weight, so it came _last_ into Form.

The real _Lineage_ and ^Succession^ _of Wit,_ is indeed plainly founded in _Nature:_ as our Author has endeavour'd to make appear both from _History_ and _Fact._ The ^Greek^ _Nation,_ as it is _Original_ to us, in respect to these polite _Arts_ and _Sciences,_ so it was in reality _original to it-self._ For whether the ^Egyptians,Phenicians,Thracians,^ or ^Barbarians^ of any _kind,_ may have hit fortunately on _this_ or _that_ particular Invention, either in Agriculture, Building, Navigation, or Letters; which-ever may have introduc'd _this_ Rite of Worship, _this_ Title of a Deity, _this_ or _that_ Instrument of Musick, _this_ or _that_ Festival, Game, or Dance, (for on this matter there are high Debates among the Learned) 'tis evident, beyond a doubt, that the _Arts_ and _Sciences_ were form'd in ^Greece^ it-self. 'Twas there that _Musick, Poetry,_ and the rest came to receive some kind of shape, and be distinguish'd into their several Orders and Degrees. Whatever flourish'd, or was rais'd to any degree of Correctness, or real Perfection in the kind, was by means of ^Greece^ alone, and in the hand of that sole polite, most civiliz'd, and accomplish'd Nation.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor can this appear strange, when we consider the fortunate Constitution of that People. For tho compos'd of different Nations, distinct in Laws and Governments, divided by Seas and Continents, dispers'd in distant Islands; yet being originally of the same Extract, united by one single Language, and animated by that social, publick and _free_ Spirit, which notwithstanding the Animosity of their several warring States, induc'd them to erect such heroick Congresses and Powers as those which constituted the ^Amphictonian^ _Councils,_ the ^Olympick,Isthmian,^ and other _Games;_ they cou'd not but naturally polish and refine each other. 'Twas thus they brought their beautiful and comprehensive Language to a just _Standard,_ leaving only such Variety in the Dialects as render'd their Poetry, in particular, so much the more agreeable. The _Standard_ was in the same proportion carry'd into other _Arts._ The _Secretion_ was made. The several _Species_ found, and set apart. The Performers and Masters in every kind, honour'd and admir'd. And, last of all, even ^Criticks^ themselves acknowledg'd and receiv'd as _Masters_ over all the rest. From _Musick, Poetry, Rhetorick,_ down to the simple Prose of _History,_ thro' all the plastick Arts of _Sculpture, Statuary, Painting, Architecture,_ and the rest; every thing _Muse-like,_ graceful and exquisite, was rewarded with the highest Honours, and carry'd on with the utmost Ardor and Emulation. Thus ^Greece,^ tho she _exported_ Arts to other Nations, had properly for her own share no _Import_ of the kind. The utmost which cou'd be nam'd, wou'd amount to no more than raw _Materials,_ of a rude and barbarous form. And thus the Nation was evidently _Original_ in Art; and with them every noble Study and Science was (as the great Master, so often cited by our Author, says of certain kinds of Poetry)[n5] _self-form'd,_ wrought out of Nature, and drawn from the necessary Operation and Course of things, working, as it were, of their own accord, and proper inclination. Now according to this _natural_ Growth of Arts, peculiar to ^Greece,^ it wou'd necessarily happen; That at the beginning, when the Force of Language came to be first prov'd; when the admiring World made their first _Judgment,_ and essay'd their _Taste_ in the Elegancys of this sort; the _Lofty,_ the _Sublime,_ the _Astonishing_ and _Amazing_ wou'd be the most in fashion, and prefer'd. _Metaphorical_ Speech, Multiplicity of _Figures_ and _high_-sounding Words wou'd naturally prevail. Tho in the Common-wealth it-self, and in the Affairs of Government, Men were us'd originally to plain and direct Speech; yet when Speaking became _an Art,_ and was taught by Sophists, and other pretended Masters, the _high-poetick,_ and the _figurative_ Way began to prevail, even at the Bar, and in the Publick Assemblys: Insomuch that the Grand-Master, in the[n6] above-cited part of his _Rhetoricks,_ where he extols the Tragick Poet ^Euripides,^ upbraids the Rhetoricians of his own Age, who retain'd that very bombastick Style, which even _Poets,_ and those too of the tragick kind, had already thrown off, or at least considerably mitigated. But the _Taste_ of ^Greece^ was now polishing. A better Judgment was soon form'd, when a ^Demosthenes^ was heard, and had found success. The People themselves (as our Author has shewn) came now to reform their ^Comedy,^ and familiar Manner, after ^Tragedy,^ and the higher Style, had been brought to its perfection under the last hand of an ^Euripides.^ And now in all the principal Works of _Ingenuity_ and _Art,_ ^Simplicity^ and ^Nature^ began chiefly to be sought: And this was the ^Taste^ which lasted thro' so many Ages, till the Ruin of all things, under a Universal Monarchy.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the Reader shou'd peradventure be led by his Curiosity to seek some kind of Comparison between this antient _Growth_ of ^Taste,^ and that which we have experienc'd in modern days, and within our own Nation; he may look back to the _Speeches_ of our Ancestors in Parliament. He will find 'em generally speaking, to have been very short and plain, but coarse, and what we properly call _home-spun;_ till _Learning_ came in vogue, and _Science_ was known amongst us. When our Princes and Senators became Scholars, they spoke _scholastically._ And the _pedantick Style_ was prevalent, from the first Dawn of Letters, about the Age of the Reformation, till long afterwards. Witness the best written Discourses, the admir'd Speeches, Orations, or Sermons, thro' several Reigns, down to these latter, which we compute within the present Age. 'Twill undoubtedly be found, That till very late days, the Fashion of speaking, and the Turn of Wit, was after the _figurative_ and _florid_ Manner. Nothing was so acceptable as the high-sounding Phrase, the far-fetch'd Comparison, the capricious Point, and Play of Words; and nothing so despicable as what was merely of the plain or natural kind. So that it must either be confess'd, that in respect of the preceding Age, we are fallen very low in ^Taste;^ or that, if we are in reality improv'd, the _natural_ and _simple_ Manner which _conceals_ and _covers_ ^Art,^ is the most truly _artful,_ and of the genteelest, truest, and best-study'd Taste: as has[n7] above been treated more at large.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"NOW, THEREFORE, as to our Author's ^Philosophy^ it-self, as it lies conceal'd in[n8] _this_ Treatise, but more profess'd and formal in his[n9] _next;_ we shall proceed gradually according to his own Method: since it becomes not one who has undertaken the part of his airy Assistant and humorous _Paraphrast,_ to enter suddenly, without good preparation, into his _dry_ Reasonings and _moral_ Researches about the _social Passions_ and _natural Affections,_ of which he is such a punctilious _Examiner._","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of all human Affections, the noblest and most becoming human Nature, is that of ^Love^ _to one's Country._ This, perhaps, will easily be allow'd by all Men, who have _really_ a ^Country,^ and are of the number of those who may be call'd[n10] ^aPeople,^ as enjoying the Happiness of a real Constitution and Polity, by which they are _free_ and _independent._ There are few such _Country-men_ or _Free-men_ so degenerate, as _directly_ to discountenance or condemn this Passion of Love to their Community and national Brotherhood.

And in this View it cannot, I confess, be deny'd, that we have each of us a certain Relation to the mere _Earth_ it-self, the very Mould or Surface of that _Planet,_ in which, with other Animals of various sorts, We (poor Reptiles!) were also bred and nourish'd.
