We are now, in our Commentator-Capacity, arriv'd at length to his _second_ Volume, to which the three Pieces of his _first_ appear preparatory. That they were really so design'd, the _Advertisement_ to the first Edition of his _Soliloquy_ is a sufficient Proof. He took occasion there, in a line or two, under the Name of his _Printer,_ or (as he otherwise calls him) his _Amanuensis,_ to prepare us for _a more elaborate_ and methodical Piece which was to follow. We have this System now before us. Nor need we wonder, such as it is, that it came so hardly into the World, and that our Author has been deliver'd of it with so much difficulty, and after so long a time. His _Amanuensis_ and he, were not, it seems, heretofore upon such good Terms of Correspondence. Otherwise such an unshapen _Foetus,_ or false Birth, as that of which our Author in his[n2] Title-page complains, had not formerly appear'd abroad.

Now if _the_ ^Passion^ rais'd on this _Opinion_ (call it _Avarice, Pride, Vanity,_ or _Ambition_) be indeed incapable of any real Satisfaction, even under the most successful Course of Fortune; and then too, attended with perpetual Fears of Disappointment and Loss: how can the Mind be other than miserable, when possess'd by it?

Enchirid. cap. vii.] $ὄρεξιν ἀ̑ραί σε δει̑ παντελω̑ς, ἔκκλισιν ἐπὶ μόνα νεταθει̑ναι τὰ προαιρετικά.$ [Arrian. Lib. iii. cap. 22.] This subdu'd or moderated _Admiration_ or _Zeal_ in the highest Subjects of _Virtue_ and _Divinity,_ the Philosopher calls $σύμμετρον καὶ καθισταμένην τὴν ὄρεξιν$; the contrary Disposition, $τὸ ἄλογον καὶ ὠστικόν$. [Lib. ii. cap. 26.] The Reason why this over-forward Ardor and Pursuit of high Subjects runs naturally into Enthusiasm and Disorder, is shewn in what succeeds the first of the Passages here cited; _viz._ $τω̑ν δὲ ἐφ ἡμι̑ν, ὅσαν ὀρέγεσθαι καλὸν ἄν, οὐδὲν οὐδέτω σοι πάρεστι$. And hence the repeated Injunction, $ἀπόσχου ποτὲ παντάποσιν ὀρέξεως, ἵνα ποτὲ καὶ εὐλόγως ὀρεχθη̑ςῃ εἰ δ' εὐλόγως, ὅταν ἔχῃς τί ἐν σεαυτῳ̑ ἀγαθὸν εὐ̑ ὀρεχθήση$. [Lib. iii. cap. 13.] To this ^Horace,^ in one of his latest Epistles of the deeply philosophical kind, alludes. \"\"$Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui, // Ultra quam satis est Virtutem si petat ipsam.$ // [Lib. i. Ep. vi. ver. 15.]\"\" And in the beginning of the Epistle: \"\"$Nil admirari propè res est una, Numici, // Solaq; quae posset facere & servare beatum.$ // [Ibid. ver. ^i^.]\"\" For tho these first Lines (as many other of ^Horace^'s on the Subject of Philosophy) have the Air of the ^Epicurean^ _Discipline_ and ^Lucretian^ Style; yet by the whole taken together, it appears evidently on what System of antient Philosophy this Epistle was form'd. Nor was this Prohibition of the _wondering_ or _admiring_ Habit, in early Students, peculiar to _one_ kind of Philosophy alone. It was common to many; however the Reason and Account of it might differ, in one Sect from the other. The ^Pythagoreans^ sufficiently check'd their ^Tyro^'s, by silencing them so long on their first Courtship to _Philosophy._ And tho _Admiration,_ in the Peripatetick Sense, as above-mention'd, may be justly call'd the inclining Principle or first Motive to PHILOSOPHY; yet this Mistress, when once espous'd, teaches us _to admire,_ after a different manner from what we did before.
