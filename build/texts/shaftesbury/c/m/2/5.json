At Supper, and afterwards for the rest of that Night, ^Theocles^ said little. The Discourse was now manag'd chiefly by the _two_ Companions, who turn'd it upon a new sort of Philosophy; such as you will excuse me (good ^Palemon!^ ) if I pass over with more haste.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Miracles. Prodigys.# There was much said, and with great Learning, on the Nature of _Spirits_ and _Apparitions;_ of which, the most astonishing Accounts were the most ravishing with our Friends: who endeavour'd to exceed one another in this admirable way; and perform'd to a miracle in raising one another's Amazement. Nothing was so charming with them, as that which was disagreeing and odd: nothing so soothing, as that which mov'd Horror. In short, whatever was rational, plain, and easy, bore no relish; and nothing came amiss which was cross to Nature, out of Sort and Order, and in no Proportion or Harmony with the rest of Things. _Monstrous Births, Prodigys, Inchantments, Elementary Wars,_ and _Convulsions,_ were our chief Entertainment. One wou'd have thought that in a kind of Rivalship between ^Providence^ and ^Nature,^ the _latter Lady_ was made to appear as homely as possible; that her Deformitys might recommend and set off the Beautys of _the former._ For to do our Friends Justice, I must own I thought their Intention to be sincerely _religious._ But this was not a Face of _Religion_ I was like to be enamour'd with. It was not from hence I fear'd being made _enthusiastick,_ or _superstitious._ If ever I became so, I found it wou'd rather be after ^Theocles'^ s manner. The _Monuments_ and _Church-yards_ were not such powerful Scenes with me, as the _Mountains,_ the _Plains,_ the solemn _Woods_ and _Groves;_ of whose Inhabitants I chose much rather to hear, than of the other. And I was readier to fansy Truth in those poetical Fictions which ^Theocles^ made use of, than in any of his Friends ghastly Storys, so pompously set off, after the usual way, in a lofty Tone of Authority, and with an assuming Air of Truth.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Scepticism.# You may imagine, ^Palemon,^ that my[n1] _Scepticism,_ with which you so often reproach me, cou'd not well forsake me here: Nor cou'd it fail to give disturbance to our Companions, especially to the grave Gentleman, who had clash'd with me some time before. He bore with me a-while; till having lost all patience, One must certainly, said he, be Master of no small share of Assurance, to hold out against the common Opinion of the World, and deny things which are known by the Report of the most considerable part of Mankind.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This, said I, is far from being my case. You have never yet heard me deny any thing; tho I have question'd many. If I suspend my Judgment, 'tis because I have less Sufficiency than others. There are People, I know, who have so great a regard to every Fancy of _their own,_ that they can believe their very _Dreams._ But I who cou'd never pay any such deference to my _sleeping_ Fancys, am apt sometimes to question even my _waking_ Thoughts, and examine, \"Whether these are not _Dreams_ too\"; since Men have a Faculty of dreaming sometimes with their Eyes open. You will own, 'tis no small pleasure with Mankind to make their _Dreams_ pass for _Realitys;_ and that _the Love of Truth_ is, in earnest, not half so prevalent as this _Passion_ for _Novelty_ and _Surprize,_ join'd with _a Desire of making Impression,_ and _being admir'd._ However, I am so charitable still, as to think there is more of innocent _Delusion_ than voluntary _Imposture_ in the World: #Imposture.# and that they who have most impos'd on Mankind, have been happy in a certain Faculty of imposing first upon themselves; by which they have a kind of Salvo for their Consciences, and are so much the more successful, as they can act their Part more naturally, and _to the life._ Nor is it to be esteem'd a Riddle, that Mens Dreams shou'd sometimes have the good fortune of passing with 'em for Truth; when we consider, that in some Cases, that which was never so much as _dreamt_ of, or related as _Truth,_ comes afterwards to be believ'd by one who has often told it.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So that the greatest _Impostor_ in the World, reply'd he, at this rate may be allow'd _sincere._","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the _main_ of his Imposture, said I, perhaps he may; notwithstanding some pious Frauds made use of between whiles, in behalf of a Belief thought good and wholesom. And so very natural do I take this to be, that in all Religions, except the true, I look upon the greatest Zeal to be accompany'd with the strongest Inclination to deceive. For the Design and End being _the Truth,_ 'tis not customary to hesitate or be scrupulous about the Choice of Means. Whether this be true or no, I appeal to the Experience of the last Age: in which 'twill not be difficult to find very remarkable Examples, where _Imposture_ and _Zeal, Bigotry_ and _Hypocrisy_ have liv'd together, in one and the same _Character._","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let this be as it will, reply'd he, I am sorry, upon the whole, to find you of such an _incredulous_ Temper.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis just, said I, that you shou'd pity me as a Sufferer, for losing that Pleasure which I see others enjoy. For what stronger Pleasure is there with Mankind, or what do they earlier learn, or longer retain, than _the Love of hearing and relating_ _things strange and incredible?_ #Wonderment.# How wonderful a thing is _the Love of wondering,_ and of raising _Wonder!_ 'Tis the Delight of Children to hear Tales they shiver at, and the Vice of Old Age to abound in strange Storys of Times past. We come into the World wondering at every thing; and when our Wonder about common things is over, we seek something new to wonder at. Our last Scene is to tell Wonders of _our own,_ to all who will believe 'em. And amidst all this, 'tis well if ^Truth^ comes off, but moderately tainted.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis well, reply'd he, if with this _moderate_ ^Faith^ of yours, you can believe any _Miracles_ whatever.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"No matter, said I, how incredulous I am of _modern Miracles,_ if I have a right Faith in those of _former Times,_ by paying the deference due to sacred Writ.

And this Injunction I am so well fitted to comply with, that I can safely engage to keep still in the same _Faith,_ and promise _never to believe amiss._","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But is this _a Promise_ which can well be made?","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If not, and that my Belief indeed does not absolutely depend upon my self, how am I accountable for it? I may be justly punish'd for Actions, in which my Will is free: but with what justice can I be challeng'd for my Belief, if in this I am not at my liberty? If Credulity and Incredulity are Defects only in the Judgment; and the best-meaning Person in the world may err on either side, whilst a much worse Man, by having better Parts, may judg far better of the Evidence of things: how can you punish him who errs, unless you wou'd punish _Weakness,_ and say, 'tis just for Men to suffer for their Unhappiness, and not their Fault?","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am apt to think, said he, that very few of those who are punish'd for their _Incredulity,_ can be said to be Sufferers for their _Weakness._","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Taking it for granted then, reply'd I, that _Simplicity_ and _Weakness_ is more the Character of _the Credulous_ than of _the Unbelieving;_ yet I see not, but that even this way still we are as liable to suffer by our _Weakness,_ as in the contrary Case by an over-refin'd _Wit._ For if we cannot command our own Belief, how are we secure against those false Prophets, and their deluding Miracles, of which we have such Warning given us? How are we safe from Heresy and false Religion? _Credulity_ being that which delivers us up to all Impostures of this sort, and which actually at this day hold the _Pagan_ and _Mahometan_ World in Error and blind Superstition. Either therefore there is no Punishment due to wrong Belief, because we _cannot_ believe as we will our-selves; or if we _can,_ why shou'd we not promise _never to believe amiss?_ Now in respect of Miracles to come, the surest way never to believe _amiss,_ is never to believe _at all._ For being satisfy'd of the Truth of our Religion by past Miracles, so as to need no other to confirm us; the Belief of new may often do us harm, but can never do us good. Therefore as the truest Mark of a believing Christian is to seek after no Sign or Miracle to come; so the safest Station in Christianity is his, who can be mov'd by nothing of this kind, and is thus Miracle-proof. For if the _Miracle_ be on the side of his Faith, 'tis superfluous, and he needs it not; if against his Faith, let it be as great as possible, he will never regard it in the least, or believe it any other than Imposture, tho coming from an Angel. So that with all that _Incredulity_ for which you reproach me so severely, I take my-self to be still the better and more Orthodox Christian. At least I am more sure of continuing so than you, who with your Credulity may be impos'd upon by such as are far short of _Angels._ For having this preparatory Disposition, 'tis odds you may come in time to believe Miracles in any of the different _Sects,_ who, we know, all pretend to them. I am persuaded therefore, that the best Maxim to go by, is that common one, \"That _Miracles are ceas'd_\": And I am ready to defend this Opinion of mine to be the most probable in it-self, as well as most sutable to Christianity.","subId":"14","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THIS Question, upon further Debate, happen'd to divide our _two_ Companions. For the elderly Gentleman, my Antagonist, maintain'd, \"That the giving up of Miracles for the time present, wou'd be of great advantage to the Atheists.\" The younger Gentleman, his Companion, question'd, \"Whether the allowing 'em might not be of as great advantage to the Enthusiasts and Sectarys, against the National Church: This of the two being the greatest Danger, he thought, both to Religion and the State.\" He was resolv'd, therefore, for the future to be as cautious in examining these modern _Miracles,_ as he had before been eager in seeking 'em. He told us very pleasantly what an Adventurer he had been of that kind; and on how many Partys he had been engag'd, with a sort of People who were always on the hot Scent of some new _Prodigy_ or _Apparition,_ some upstart _Revelation_ or _Prophecy._ This, he thought, was true _Fanaticism errant._ #Fanaticism.# He had enough of this visionary Chace, and wou'd ramble no more in blind Corners of the World, as he had been formerly accustom'd, in ghostly Company of Spirit-hunters, Witch-finders, and Layers-out for hellish Storys and diabolical Transactions. There was no need, he thought, of such Intelligences from _Hell,_ to prove the Power of _Heaven,_ and Being of _a God._ And now at last he begun to see the Ridicule of laying such a stress on these Matters: As if _a Providence_ depended on them, and _Religion_ were at stake, when any of these wild Feats were question'd. He was sensible there were many good Christians who made themselves strong Partisans in this Cause; tho he cou'd not avoid wondring at it, now he began to consider, and look back.","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The ^Heathens,^ he said, who wanted Scripture, might have recourse to _Miracles:_ And Providence perhaps had allow'd them their _Oracles_ and _Prodigys,_ as an imperfect kind of _Revelation._ The ^Jews^ too, for their hard Heart, and harder Understanding, had this allowance; when stubbornly they ask'd for _Signs_ and _Wonders._ But ^Christians,^ for their parts, had a far better and truer _Revelation;_ they had their plainer Oracles, a more rational Law, and clearer Scripture, carrying its own Force, and withal so well attested, as to admit of no dispute. And were I, continu'd he, to assign the exact time when Miracles probably might first have ceas'd, I shou'd be tempted to fansy it was when _Sacred Writ_ took place, and was compleated.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.5.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Miracles, past, present.# This is Fancy indeed, (reply'd the grave Gentleman) and a very dangerous one to that Scripture you pretend is of it-self so well attested. The Attestation of Men dead and gone, in behalf of Miracles past and at an end, can never surely be of equal force with Miracles present: And of these, I maintain, there are never wanting a Number sufficient in the World to warrant a _Divine Existence._ If there were no Miracles now-a-days, the World wou'd be apt to think there never were any. The present must answer for the Credibility of the past.

He wou'd have done this, I said, undoubtedly, by shewing how good Proof we had already for our _sacred Oracles,_ from the Testimony of _the Dead;_ whose Characters and Lives might answer for them, as to the Truth of what they reported to us from God. This, however, was by no means \"_Witnessing for GOD,_\" as the zealous Gentleman had hastily express'd himself. For this was above the reach either of Men, or Miracles. Nor cou'd God witness _for himself,_ or assert his Being any other way to Men, #Divine Testimony.# than \"By revealing himself to their _Reason,_ appealing to their _Judgment,_ and submitting his Ways to their _Censure,_ and _cool Deliberation._\" The Contemplation of the Universe, its Laws and Government, was, I aver'd, the only means which cou'd establish the _sound Belief_ of a ^Deity.^ For what tho innumerable _Miracles_ from every part assail'd the Sense, and gave the trembling Soul no respite? #Miracles no proof of Divinity.# What tho the Sky shou'd suddenly open, and all kinds of Prodigys appear, Voices be heard, or Characters read? What wou'd this evince more than \"That there were _certain_ ^Powers^ cou'd do all this?\" But \"_What_ ^Powers;^ Whether _One,_ or _more;_ Whether _Superior,_ or _Subaltern; Mortal,_ or _Immortal; Wise,_ or _Foolish; Just,_ or _Unjust; Good,_ or _Bad_\": this wou'd still remain a Mystery; as wou'd the true Intention, the Infallibility or Certainty of whatever _these_ ^Powers^ asserted. Their Word cou'd not be taken in their own case. They might silence Men indeed, but not convince them: since \"^Power^ can never serve as Proof for[n2] _Goodness;_ and ^Goodness^ is the only Pledg of _Truth._\" By ^Goodness^ alone, _Trust_ is created. By ^Goodness^ _superior_ ^Powers^ may win Belief. They must allow their Works to be examin'd, their Actions criticiz'd: And thus, _thus_ only, they may be confided in; \"When by repeated Marks their _Benevolence_ is prov'd, and their _Character_ of _Sincerity_ and _Truth_ establish'd.\" To whom therefore the Laws of this Universe and its Government appear just and uniform; to him they speak the Government of one ^Just-One;^ to him they _reveal_ and witness a ^God:^ and laying in him the Foundation of this _first_ Faith, they fit him for _a_[n3] _subsequent One._ #Revelation.# He can then hearken to _Historical Revelation:_ and is then fitted, and not till then, for the reception of any _Message_ or miraculous _Notice_ from Above; where he knows beforehand all is just and true.
