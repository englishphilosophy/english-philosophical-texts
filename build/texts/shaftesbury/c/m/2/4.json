They wou'd have done well however, to have express'd themselves more properly in their great Maxim. For to say in disparagement of _Man,_ \"That he is _to Man a Wolf,_\" appears somewhat absurd, when one considers that _Wolves_ are _to Wolves_ very kind and loving Creatures. The Sexes strictly _join_ in the Care and Nurture of the Young; and this _Union_ is continu'd still between 'em. They houl to one another, to bring Company; whether to hunt, or invade their Prey, or assemble on the discovery of a good Carcase. Even the swinish Kinds want not _common Affection,_ and run in Herds to the assistance of their distress'd Fellows. The meaning therefore of this famous Sentence, if it has any meaning at all, must be, \"That _Man is naturally to Man, as a Wolf is to a tamer Creature_\": as, for instance, to _a Sheep._ But this will be as little to the purpose as to tell us, \"That there are _different_ Species or Characters of Men; That _all_ have not this[n6] wolfish Nature, but That _one half_ at least are _naturally_ innocent and mild.\" And thus the Sentence comes to nothing. For without belying _Nature,_ and contradicting what is evident from _natural History, Fact,_ and the plain _Course of Things,_ 'tis impossible to assent to this ill-natur'd Proposition, when we have even done our best to make tolerable sense of it.—But such is Mankind! And even _here_ ^HumanNature^ shews it-self, such as it is; not perfect, or absolutely successful, tho rightly tending, #Sect. 5.# and mov'd by proper and just Principles.
