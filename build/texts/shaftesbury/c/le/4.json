And my Notion is, that provided we treat Religion with good Manners, we can never use too much _good Humour_, or examine it with too much _Freedom_ and _Familiarity_. For, if it be genuine and sincere, it will not only stand the Proof, but thrive and gain advantage from hence: if it be spurious, or mix'd with any Imposture, it will be detected and expos'd.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The melancholy way in which we have been taught Religion, makes us unapt to think of it in good Humour. 'Tis in Adversity chiefly, or in ill Health, under Affliction, or Disturbance of Mind, or Discomposure of Temper, that we have recourse to it. Tho in reality we are never so unfit to think of it as at such a heavy and dark hour. We can never be fit to contemplate any thing above us, when we are in no condition to look into ourselves, and calmly examine the Temper of our own Mind and Passions. For then it is we see Wrath, and Fury, and Revenge, and Terrors _in the_ ^Deity^; when we are full of Disturbances and Fears _within_, and have, by Sufferance and Anxiety, lost so much of the natural Calm and Easiness of our Temper.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We must not only be in ordinary good Humour, but in the best of Humours, and in the sweetest, kindest Disposition of our Lives, to understand well what _true Goodness_ is, and what those _Attributes_ imply, which we ascribe with such Applause and Honour to _the_ ^Deity^. We shall then be able to see best, whether those Forms of Justice, those Degrees of Punishment, that Temper of Resentment, and those Measures of Offence and Indignation, which we vulgarly suppose in ^God^, are sutable to those original Ideas of _Goodness_, which the same Divine Being, or Nature under him, has implanted in us, and which we must necessarily presuppose, in order to give him Praise or Honour in any kind. This, my Lord, is the Security against all Superstition: To remember, that there is nothing in ^God^ but what is _God-like_; and that He is either _not at all_, or _truly and perfectly Good_. But when we are afraid to use our Reason freely, even on that very Question, \"Whether He really _be_, or _not_\"; we then actually presume him _bad_, and flatly contradict that pretended Character of Goodness and Greatness; whilst we discover this Mistrust of his Temper, and fear his Anger and Resentment, in the case of this _Freedom of_ ^Inquiry^.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We have a notable Instance of this _Freedom_ in one of our sacred Authors. As patient as ^Job^ is said to be, it cannot be denied that he makes bold enough with ^God^, and takes his Providence roundly to task. His Friends, indeed, plead hard with him, and use all Arguments, right or wrong, to patch up Objections, and set the Affairs of Providence upon an equal foot. They make a merit of saying all the Good they can of ^God^, at the very stretch of their Reason, and sometimes quite beyond it. But this, in ^Job^'s opinion, is[n1] _flattering_ ^God^, _accepting of_ ^God^'s _Person_, and even _mocking him_. And no wonder. For, what merit can there be in believing ^God^, or his _Providence_, upon frivolous and weak grounds? What Virtue in assuming an Opinion contrary to the appearance of Things, and resolving to hear nothing which may be said against it? Excellent Character of the ^God^ _of Truth_! that he shou'd be offended at us, for having refus'd to put the lye upon our Understandings, as much as in us lay; and be satisfy'd with us for having believ'd at a venture, and against our Reason, what might have been the greatest Falshood in the world, for any thing we cou'd bring as a Proof or Evidence to the contrary!","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is impossible that any besides an ill-natur'd Man can wish against the Being of a ^God^: for this is wishing against the Publick, and even against one's private Good too, if rightly understood. But if a Man has not any such Ill-will to stifle his Belief, he must have surely an unhappy Opinion of ^God^, and believe him not so good by far as he knows _Himself_ to be, if he imagines that an impartial Use of his Reason, in any matter of Speculation whatsoever, can make him run any risk Hereafter; and that a mean _Denial of his Reason_, and an _Affectation of Belief_ in any Point too hard for his Understanding, can intitle him to any Favour in another World. This is being _Sycophants_ in Religion, mere _Parasites_ of Devotion. 'Tis using ^God^ as the crafty[n2] Beggars use those they address to, when they are ignorant of their Quality. The Novices amongst 'em may innocently come out, perhaps, with a _Good Sir_, or a _Good Forsooth_! But with the old Stagers, no matter whom they meet in a Coach, 'tis always _Good your Honour_! or _Good your Lordship_! or _your Ladyship_! For if there shou'd be really a _Lord_ in the case, we shou'd be undone (say they) for want of giving the Title: but if the Party shou'd be no _Lord_, there wou'd be no Offence; it wou'd not be ill taken.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And thus it is in Religion. We are highly concern'd how to _beg right_; and think all depends upon hitting _the Title_, and making _a good Guess_. 'Tis the most beggarly Refuge imaginable, which is so mightily cry'd up, and stands as a great Maxim with many able Men; \"That they shou'd strive to have _Faith_, and believe to the utmost: because if, after all, there be nothing in the matter, there will be no harm in being thus deceiv'd; but if there be any thing, it will be fatal for them not to have believ'd to the full.\" But they are so far mistaken, that whilst they have this Thought`, 'tis certain they can never believe either to their Satisfaction and Happiness in this World, or with any advantage of Recommendation to another. For besides that our Reason, which knows the Cheat, will never rest thorowly satisfy'd on such a Bottom, but turn us often a-drift, and toss us in a Sea of Doubt and Perplexity; we cannot but actually grow _worse_ in our Religion, and entertain _a worse_ Opinion still of _a Supreme_ ^Deity^, whilst our Belief is founded on so injurious a Thought` of him.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To love the Publick, to study universal Good, and to promote the Interest of the whole World, as far as lies within our power, is surely the Height of Goodness, and makes that Temper which we call _Divine_. In this Temper, my Lord, (for surely you shou'd know it well) 'tis natural for us to wish that others shou'd partake with us, by being convinc'd of the Sincerity of our Example. 'Tis natural for us to wish our Merit shou'd be known; particularly, if it be our fortune to have serv'd a Nation as a good Minister; or as some Prince, or Father of a Country, to have render'd happy a considerable Part of Mankind under our Care. But if it happen'd, that of this number there shou'd be some so ignorantly bred, and of so remote a Province, as to have lain out of the hearing of our Name and Actions; or hearing of 'em, shou'd be so puzzl'd with odd and contrary Storys told up and down concerning us, that they knew not what to think, whether there were really in the World any such Person as our-self: Shou'd we not, in good truth, be ridiculous to take offence at this? And shou'd we not pass for extravagantly morose and ill-humour'd, if instead of treating the matter _in Raillery_, we shou'd think in earnest of _revenging our-selves_ on the offending Partys, who, out of their rustick Ignorance, ill Judgment, or Incredulity, had detracted from our Renown?","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How shall we say then? Does it really deserve Praise, to be thus concern'd about it? Is the doing Good for _Glory_'s sake, so divine a thing? or, Is it not diviner, to do Good even where it may be thought inglorious, even to the Ingrateful, and to those who are wholly insensible of the Good they receive? How comes it then, that what is so _divine_ in us, shou'd lose its Character in _the Divine Being_? And that according as _the_ ^Deity^ is represented to us, he shou'd more resemble the weak[n3], womanish, and impotent part of our Nature, than the generous, manly, and divine?","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.8"},{"type":"note","content":"[Chap. xiii. ver. 7, 8, 9, & 10.]","subId":"n1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.n1"},{"type":"note","content":"[VOL.
