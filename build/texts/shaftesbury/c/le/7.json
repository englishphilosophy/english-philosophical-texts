For, as some have well remark'd, there have been _Enthusiastical Atheists_. Nor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily distinguish'd from it. For Inspiration is _a real_ feeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm _a false one_. But the Passion they raise is much alike. For when the Mind is taken up in Vision, and fixes its view either on any real Object, or mere Specter of Divinity; when it sees, or thinks it sees any thing prodigious, and more than human; its Horror, Delight, Confusion, Fear, Admiration, or whatever Passion belongs to it, or is uppermost on this occasion, will have something vast, _immane_, and (as Painters say) _beyond Life_. And this is what gave occasion to the name of _Fanaticism_, as it was us'd by the Antients in its original Sense, for an _Apparition_ transporting the Mind.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.7.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Something there will be of Extravagance and Fury, when the Ideas or Images receiv'd are too big for the narrow human Vessel to contain. So that _Inspiration_ may be justly call'd _Divine_ ^Enthusiasm^: For the Word it-self signifies _Divine Presence_, and was made use of by the Philosopher whom the earliest Christian Fathers call'd _Divine_, to express whatever was sublime in human Passions[n2]. This was the Spirit he allotted to _Heroes, Statesmen, Poets, Orators, Musicians_, and even _Philosophers_ themselves. Nor can we, of our own accord, forbear ascribing to a[n3] noble ^Enthusiasm^, whatever is greatly perform'd by any of _These_. So that almost all of us know something of this Principle. But to know it as we shou'd do, and discern it in its several kinds, both in our-selves, and others; this is the great Work, and by this means alone we can hope to avoid Delusion. For _to judg the Spirits whether they are of God_, we must antecedently _judg our own Spirit_; whether it be of _Reason_ and _sound Sense_; whether it be fit to _judg_ at all, by being sedate, cool, and impartial; free of every biassing Passion, every giddy Vapor, or melancholy Fume. This is the first Knowledg and previous Judgment: \"To understand _our-selves_, and know _what Spirit we are of_.\" Afterwards we may judg the _Spirit_ in others, consider what their personal Merit is, and prove the Validity of their Testimony by the Solidity of their Brain. By this means we may prepare our-selves with some _Antidote_ against Enthusiasm. And this is what I have dar'd affirm is best perform'd by keeping to ^Good Humour^. For otherwise the Remedy it-self may turn to the Disease.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.7.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And now, my Lord, having, after all, in some measure justify'd ^Enthusiasm^, and own'd the Word; if I appear extravagant, in addressing to you after the manner I have done, you must allow me to plead an _Impulse_. You must suppose me (as with truth you may) most passionately yours; and with that Kindness which is natural to you on other occasions, you must tolerate your _Enthusiastick Friend_, who, excepting only in the case of this over-forward _Zeal_, must ever appear with the highest Respect, // ~~^My Lord^, // ~~~~_Your Lordship's_, &c.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.7.3"},{"type":"note","content":"[VOL.

For speaking of one of the Philosophers of the _Athenian_ Embassy, he says, $ἔρωτα δεινὸν ἐμβέβληκε τοι̑ς νέοις ὑφ' οὑ̑ τω̑ν ἄλλων ἡδονω̑ν καὶ διατριβω̑ν ἐκπεσόντες ἐνθουσιω̑σι τερὶ φιλοσοφίαν.$ [Plut. _Cato Major_.] =Plato=, [_Phaedrus_, 241 ^e^], seems here misquoted. The accepted text means: I suppose you know that I shall be quite possessed ($ἐνθουσιάσω$) by the nymphs, to whom you have designedly exposed me. [Plato, _Menon_, 99 ^d^]: And, among them, we should say that the politicians were specially rapt and inspired ($ἐνθουσιάζειν$). [Plato, _Apol_. 22 ^b^] (slightly misquoted). The right version would give: So I observed also about poets in a short time that they did not compose out of wisdom, but from an instinct and an inspiration ($ἐνθουσιάζοντες$) like seers and prophets. [Plutarch, _Cato Major_, 22]: He put a spell upon young men, under which they give up other pleasures and amusements, and are possessed by philosophy ($ἐνθουσιω̑σι$).","subId":"n2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.7.n2"},{"type":"note","content":"Of this Passion, in the nobler and higher sense, see more, [VOL.
