But as these belong chiefly to the _ordinary Life,_ and to the _comick,_ or _mix'd_ kind; our Tablature, which on the contrary is wholly _epick, heroick,_ and in the _tragick_ Style, wou'd not so easily admit of any thing in this light way.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(2.) We may besides consider, that whereas the Mind is naturally led to fansy Mystery in a Work of such a Genius or Style of Painting as ours, and to confound with each other the two distinct kinds of the _emblematick,_ and merely _historical,_ or _poetick;_ we shou'd take care not to afford it this occasion of Error and Deviation, by introducing into a Piece of so uniform a Design, such Appendices, or supplementary Parts, as, under pretext of giving light to the History, or characterizing the Figures, shou'd serve only to distract or dissipate the Sight, and confound the Judgment of the more intelligent Spectators.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(3.) \"Will it then,\" says one, \"be possible to make out the Story of these two _Dames_ in company with ^Hercules^, without otherwise distinguishing them than as above describ'd?\"—We answer, it is possible; and not that only, but certain and infallible, in the case of one who has the least Genius, or has ever heard in general concerning ^Hercules^, without so much as having ever heard this History in particular. But if, notwithstanding this, we wou'd needs add some exterior marks, more declaratory and determinative of these two Personages, ^Virtue^ and ^Pleasure^; it may be perform'd, however, without any necessary recourse to what is absolutely of the _Emblem_-kind. The Manner of this may be explain'd as follows.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.) The Energy or natural Force of _Virtue,_ according to the moral Philosophy of highest note among the Antients, was express'd in the double effect of[n2] _Forbearance_ and _Indurance,_ or what we may otherwise call _Refrainment_ and _Support._ For the former, _the Bit_ or _Bridle,_ plac'd somewhere on the side of _Virtue,_ may serve as Emblem sufficient; and for the second, _the Helmet_ may serve in the same manner; especially since they are each of them Appurtenances essential to _Heroes,_ (who, in the quality of Warriors, were also Subduers or[n3] Managers of Horses) and that at the same time these are really portable Instruments, such as the martial Dame, who represents _Virtue,_ may be well suppos'd to have brought along with her.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(5.) On the side of ^Pleasure^, certain _Vases,_ and other Pieces of imboss'd Plate, wrought in the figures of _Satyrs, Fauns,_ and _Bacchanals,_ may serve to express the Debauches of the Table-kind. And certain Draperys thrown carelesly on the ground, and hung upon a neighbouring Tree, forming a kind of Bower and Couch for this luxurious Dame, may serve sufficiently to suggest the Thought of other Indulgences, and to support the Image of the effeminate, indolent, and amorous Passions. Besides that, for this latter kind, we may rest satisfy'd, 'tis what the Painter will hardly fail of representing to the full. The fear is, lest he shou'd overdo this part, and express the Affection too much to the life. The Appearance will, no doubt, be strongly wrought in all the Features and Proportions of this _third Figure;_ which is of a relish far more popular, and vulgarly ingaging, than that _other_ oppos'd to it, in our historical Design.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.5"},{"type":"note","content":"_This is understood of the_ Machine-Work, _when it is merely ornamental, and not essential in the Piece; by making part of the History, or Fable it-self._","subId":"n1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.6.n1"},{"type":"note","content":"Καρτερία, Εγκρατεία: _They were describ'd as Sisters in the emblematick Moral Philosophy of the Antients.
