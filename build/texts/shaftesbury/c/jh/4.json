The Truth of _Appearance,_ that of _History,_ and even the _Decorum_ it-self, (according to what has been explain'd above) require evidently that in this Period or Instant describ'd, ^Pleasure^ shou'd be found silent. She can have no other Language allow'd her than that merely of _the Eyes._ And 'twou'd be a happy Management for her in the Design, if in turning her Eyes to meet those of ^Hercules^, she shou'd find his Head and Face already turn'd so much on the contrary side, as to shew it impossible for her as yet to discover the growing Passion of this Hero in favour of her Rival. By this means she might still with good right retain her fond Airs of Dalliance and Courtship; as having yet discover'd no reason she has to be dissatisfy'd.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(2.) She may be drawn either _standing, leaning, sitting,_ or _lying;_ without a Crown, or crown'd either with Roses, or with Myrtle; according to the Painter's Fancy. And since in this _third_ Figure the Painter has so great a liberty left him, he may make good advantage of it for the other _two,_ to which _this latter_ may be subjected, as the last in order, and of least consequence.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(3.) That which makes the greatest difficulty in the Disposition or Ordonnance of this Figure ^Pleasure^, is, that notwithstanding the supine Air and Character of Ease and Indolence, which shou'd be given her, she must retain still so much Life and Action, as is sufficient to express her _persuasive Effort,_ and Manner of _Indication_ towards her proper Paths; those of the flowery kind, and Vale below, whither she wou'd willingly guide our Hero's steps. Now shou'd this _Effort_ be over-strongly express'd; not only the supine Character and Air of Indolence wou'd be lost in this Figure of ^Pleasure^; but, what is worse, the Figure wou'd seem to speak, or at least appear so, as to create a double Meaning, or _equivocal Sense_ in Painting: which wou'd destroy what we have establish'd as fundamental, concerning the absolute Reign of _Silence_ thro'out the rest of the Piece, in favour of ^Virtue^, the sole speaking Party at this Instant, or third Period of our History.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.) According to a Computation, which in this way of Reasoning might be made, of the whole _Motion_ or _Action_ to be given to our Figure of ^Pleasure^; she shou'd scarce have _one fifth_ reserv'd for that which we may properly call _active_ in her, and have already term'd her _persuasive_ or _indicative Effort._ All besides shou'd be employ'd to express, if one may say so, her _Inaction,_ her _Supineness, Effeminacy,_ and _indulgent Ease._ The Head and Body might intirely favour this latter Passion. One Hand might be absolutely resign'd to it; serving only to support, with much ado, the lolling lazy Body. And if the other Hand be requir'd to express some kind of Gesture or Action toward the Road of Pleasures recommended by this Dame; the Gesture ought however to be slight and negligent, in the manner of one who has given over speaking, and appears weary and spent.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(5.)
