I can call to mind, indeed, among my Acquaintance, certain Merchant-Adventurers in the Letter-Trade, who in correspondence with their Factor-Bookseller, are enter'd into a notable Commerce with _the World._ They have directly, and in due Form of _Preface,_ and _Epistle Dedicatory,_ sollicited _the Publick,_ and made Interest with Friends for Favour and Protection on this account. They have ventur'd, perhaps, to join some great Man's Reputation with their own; having obtain'd his Permission to address a Work to him, on presumption of its passing for something considerable in the eyes of _Mankind._ One may easily imagine that such patroniz'd and avow'd _Authors_ as these, wou'd be shreudly disappointed if _the Publick_ took no notice of their Labours. But for my own part, 'tis of no concern to me, what regard _the Publick_ bestows on my Amusements; or after what manner it comes acquainted with what I write for my private Entertainment, or by way of _Advice_ to such of my Acquaintance as are thus desperately embark'd.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis requisite, that my Friends, who peruse these _Advices,_ shou'd read 'em in better Characters than those of my own Hand-writing. And by good luck I have a very fair Hand offer'd, which may save me the trouble of re-copying, and can readily furnish me with as many handsom Copys as I wou'd desire, for my own and Friends Service. I have not, indeed, forbid my _Amanuensis_ the making as many as he pleases for his own Benefit. What I write is not worth being made a Mystery. And if it be worth any one's purchasing; much good may do the Purchaser.

Nor can I imagine why the Machine shou'd appear so formidable to Scholars, and renown'd Clerks; whose very Mystery and Foundation depends on the Letter-Manufacture. To allow _Benefit of Clergy,_ and _to restrain the Press,_ seems to me to have something of Cross-purpose in it. I can hardly think that _the Qua__lity_ of what is written can be alter'd by _the Manner_ of Writing; or that there can be any harm in a quick way of copying fair, and keeping Copys alike. Why a Man may not be permitted to write with _Iron_ as well as _Quill,_ I can't conceive; or how a Writer changes his Capacity, by this new Dress, any more than by the wear of _Wove_-Stockins, after having worn no other Manufacture than _the Knit._","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"SO MUCH for my _Reader;_ if perchance I have any besides the Friend or two above-mention'd.

What Distaste possibly may have arisen from some medicinal Doses of a like nature, administer'd to raw Stomachs, at a very early Age, I will not pretend to examine. But whatever Manner in Philosophy happens to bear the least resemblance to that of _Catechism,_ cannot, I'm persuaded, of it-self, prove very inviting. Such a smart way of questioning our-selves in our Youth, has made our Manhood more averse to the expostulatory Discipline. And tho the _metaphysical_ Points of our Belief are by this method, with admirable Care and Caution, instill'd into tender Minds; yet the manner of this anticipating Philosophy, may make the After-work of Reason, and the inward Exercise of the Mind, at a riper Age, proceed the more heavily, and with greater reluctance.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must needs be a hard Case with us, after having pass'd so learned a Childhood, and been instructed in our own and other higher _Natures, Essences, incorporeal Substances, Personalitys,_ and the like; to condescend at riper Years to ruminate and con over this Lesson a second time.

So far are they from such forwardness, that they often stand as at a distance; suffering us to make the first advance, and contenting themselves with discovering a Side-face, or bestowing now and then a glance in a mysterious manner, as if they endeavour'd to conceal their Persons.","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One of the most dangerous of these _Enchantresses_ appears in a sort of dismal Weed, with the most mournful Countenance imaginable; often casting up her Eyes, and wringing her Hands; so that 'tis impossible not to be mov'd by her, till her Meaning be consider'd, and her Imposture fully known. The Airs she borrows, are from the tragick Muse ^Melpomene.^ Nor is she in her own Person any way amiable or attractive. Far from it. Her Art is to render her-self as forbidding as possible; that her Sisters may by her means be the more alluring. And if by her tragick Aspect, and melancholy Looks, she can persuade us that _Death_ (whom she represents) is such a hideous Form; she conquers in behalf of the whole fantastick Tribe of wanton, gay, and fond Desires. Effeminacy and Cowardice instantly prevail. The poorest _Means_ of Life grow in repute, when the _Ends_ and _just Conditions_ of it are so little known, and the Dread of parting with it, rais'd to so high a degree. The more eagerly we grasp at _Life,_ the more impotent we are in the Enjoyment of it. By this Avidity, its very Lees and Dregs are swallow'd. The Ideas of sordid Pleasure are advanc'd. Worth, Manhood, Generosity, and all the nobler Opinions and Sentiments of _honest_ ^Good,^ and _virtuous Pleasure,_ disappear, and fly before this _Queen of Terrors._","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis a mighty Delight which a sort of Counter-Philosophers take in seconding this _Phantom,_ and playing her upon our Understandings, whenever they wou'd take occasion to confound 'em.

By the help of this tragick Actress, they gain a fairer Audience for the luxurious Fancys; and give their ^Erato'^ s, and other playsom _Muses_ a fuller Scope in the support of Riot and Debauch. The gloomy Prospect of Death becomes the Incentive to Pleasures of the lowest Order. _Ashes_ and _Shade,_ the _Tomb_ and _Cypress,_ are made to serve as Foils to _Luxury._ The Abhorrence of an insensible State makes mere Vitality and Animal-Sensation highly cherish'd.","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"[n5]Give your genius play; let us take our pleasures; your life (alone) is ours; you will (soon) be but dust, a ghost, a name.","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis no wonder if _Luxury_ profits by the Deformity of this Specter-Opinion. She supports her Interest by this childish Bugbear; and, like a Mother by her Infant, is hugg'd so much the closer by her Votary, as the Fear presses him, and grows importunate. She invites him to _live fast,_ according to her best measure of _Life._ And well she may. Who wou'd not willingly make _Life_ pass away as quickly as was possible; when the nobler Pleasures of it were already lost or corrupted by a wretched _Fear of Death?_ The intense Selfishness and Meanness which accompanys this Fear, must reduce us to a low ebb of Enjoyment; and in a manner bring to nothing that main Sum of satisfactory Sensations, by which we vulgarly rate the Happiness of our private Condition and Fortune.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But see! A lovely Form advances to our Assistance, introduc'd by the prime _Muse,_ the beauteous ^Calliope!^ She shews us what real _Beauty_ is, and what those _Numbers_ are, which make Life perfect, and bestow _the chief Enjoyment._ She sets _Virtue_ before our Eyes, and teaches us how to rate _Life,_ from the Experience of the most heroick Spirits. She brings her Sisters ^Clio^ and ^Urania^ to support her. From _the former_ she borrows whatever is memorable in History, and antient Time, to confront the tragick Specter, and shew the fix'd Contempt which the happiest and freest Nations, as well as single Heroes, and private Men worthy of any Note, have ever express'd for that Impostress. From _the latter_ she borrows what is sublimest in Philosophy, to explain the Laws of Nature, the Order of the Universe, and represent to us the Justice of accompanying this amiable Administration. She shews us, that by this just Compliance we are made happiest: and that the measure of a happy Life is not from the fewer or more Suns we behold, the fewer or more Breaths we draw, or Meals we repeat; but from the having _once liv'd well,_ acted our _Part_ handsomly, and made our _Exit_ chearfully, and as became us.","subId":"22","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus we retain on Virtue's side the noblest Party of the _Muses._ Whatever is august amongst those Sisters, appears readily in our behalf.

Such were the nobler _Lyricks,_ and those of the _latter,_ and _more refin'd Comedy_ of the Antients. The ^Thalia'^ s, the ^Polyhymnia'^ s, the ^Terpsychore'^ s, the ^Euterpe'^ s willingly join their Parts; and being alike interested in the Cause of _Numbers,_ are with regret employ'd another way, in favour of _Disorder._ Instead of being made _Syrens_ to serve the Purposes of Vice, they wou'd with more delight accompany their elder Sisters, and add their Graces and attractive Charms to what is most harmonious, Muse-like, and Divine in human Life. There is this difference only between these and the more heroick Dames; that they can more easily be perverted, and take the vicious Form. For what Person of any Genius or masterly Command in the poetick Art, cou'd think of bringing the _Epick_ or _Tragick_ Muse to act the Pandar, or be subservient to Effeminacy and Cowardice? 'Tis not against Death, Hazards or Toils, that _Tragedy_ and the heroick Fable are pointed. 'Tis not _mere Life_ which is here exalted, or has its Price enhanc'd. On the contrary, its Calamitys are expos'd: the Disorders of the Passions set to view: Fortitude recommended: Honour advanc'd: the Contempt of Death plac'd as the peculiar Note of every generous and happy Soul; and the tenacious Love of Life, as the truest Character of an abject Wretch.","subId":"23","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"[n6]Is it so hard to die?","subId":"24","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not to be imagin'd how easily we deal with the deluding _Apparitions_ and false Ideas of Happiness and Good; when this frightful _Specter_ of Misery and Ill, is after this manner well laid, and by honest Magick conjur'd down; so as not to give the least assistance to the other tempting _Forms._ This is that _occult_ Science, or sort of Counter-_Necromancy,_ which instead of Ghastliness and Horror, inspires only what is gentle and humane, and dispels the imposing Phantoms of every kind.

The Story is sufficiently noted. All the Artifice employ'd against the Prince was a well-manag'd Interrogatory of _what next?_ Lady-^Fancy^ was not aware of the Design upon her; but let her-self be worm'd out, by degrees. At first, she said the Prince's design was only upon a Tract of Land, which stood out like a Promontory before him, and seem'd to eclipse his Glory. A fair rich Island, which was close by, presented it-self next, and as it were naturally invited Conquest. The opposite Coast came next in view. Then the Continent on each side the larger Sea. And then (what was easiest of all, and wou'd follow of course) the Dominion both of Sea and Land. \"And _What next?_ reply'd the Friend. What shall we do, when we are become thus happy, and have obtain'd our highest Wish?\" \"Why then, we'll sit down peaceably, and be good Company over a Bottle.\" \"Alas, Sir! What hinders us from doing the same, where we now are? Will our Humour, or our Wine grow better? Shall we be more secure, or at Heart's Ease? What you may possibly lose by these Attempts, is easy to conceive. But which way you will be a Gainer, your _own Fancy_ (you see) cannot so much as suggest.\" ^Fancy^ in the mean while carry'd her point: for she was absolute over the Monarch; and had been too little talk'd to _by her-self,_ to bear being reprov'd _in Company._ The Prince grew sullen; turn'd the Discourse; abhor'd the Profanation offer'd to his Sovereign-Empress; deliver'd up his Thoughts to her again with deep Devotion, and fell to conquering with all his Might. The Sound of _Victory_ rung in his Ears. _Laurels_ and _Crowns_ play'd before his Eyes.—What was this beside _Giddiness_ and _Dream? Appearances_ uncorrected? \"Worlds dancing? Phantoms playing?\"","subId":"39","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.39"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"_Seas of Milk, and Ships of Amber!_\"","subId":"40","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.40"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^'Tis^ easy to bring the _Hero's_ Case home to our-selves; and see, in the ordinary Circumstances of Life, how _Love, Ambition,_ and the gayer Tribe of _Fancys_ (as well as the gloomy and dark _Specters_ of another sort) prevail over our Mind.
