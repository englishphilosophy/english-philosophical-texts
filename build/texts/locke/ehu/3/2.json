The Comfort therefore, and Advantage of Society, not being to be had without Communication of Thoughts, it was necessary, that Man should find out some external sensible Signs, whereby those invisible _Ideas,_ which possess his Mind in so great variety, might be made known to others: For which purpose, nothing was so fit, either for Plenty or Quickness, as those articulate Sounds, which with so much Ease and Variety, he found himself able to make. Thus we may conceive how _Words,_ which were by Nature so well adapted to that purpose, come to be made use of by Men, as _the Signs of_ their _Ideas_; not by any natural connection, that there is between particular articulate Sounds, and certain _Ideas,_ for then there would be but one Language amongst all Men; but by a voluntary Imposition, whereby such a Word is made arbitrarily the Mark of such an _Idea._ The use then of Words, is to be sensible Marks of _Ideas_; and the _Ideas_ they stand for, are their proper and immediate Signification.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The use Men have of these Marks, being either to record their own _Ideas_ for the Assistence of their own Memory; or as it were, to bring them out, and lay them before the view of others. _Words in their primary and immediate Signification, stand for nothing, but the_ Ideas _in the Mind of him that uses them,_ how imperfectly soever, or carelesly those _Ideas_ are collected from the Things, which they are supposed to represent. When a Man speaks to another, it is, that he may be understood; and the end of the Speech is, that those Sounds, as Marks, may make known his _Ideas_ to the Hearer. That then which Words are the Marks of, are the _Ideas_ of the Speaker: Nor can any one apply them, as Marks immediately to any thing else, but the _Ideas_ that he himself hath: For this would be to make them Signs of his own Conception, and yet apply them to other _Ideas_; which would be to make them Signs, and not Signs of his _Ideas_ at the same time; and so in Effect, to have no Signification at all. Words being voluntary Signs, they cannot be voluntary Signs imposed by him on Things he knows not. That would be to make them Signs of nothing, Sounds without Signification. A Man cannot make his Words the Signs either of Qualities in Things, or of Conceptions in the Mind of another, whereof he has none in his own. Till he has some _Ideas_ of his own, he cannot suppose them to correspond with the Conceptions of another Man; nor can he use any Signs for them: For it would be the Signs of he knows not what, which is in Truth to be the Sign of nothing. But when he represents to himself other Men's _Ideas,_ by some of his own, if he consent to give them the same Names, that other Men do, 'tis still to his own _Ideas_; to _Ideas_ that he has, and not to _Ideas_ that he has not.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is so necessary in the use of Language, that in this respect, the Knowing, and the Ignorant; the Learned, and Unlearned, use the _Words_ they speak (with any meaning) all alike. They, _in every Man's Mouth, stand for the_ Ideas _he has,_ and which he would express by them. A Child having taken notice of nothing in the Metal he hears called Gold, but the bright shining Yellow-Colour, he applies the Word Gold only to his own _Idea_ of that Colour, and nothing else; and therefore calls the same Colour in a Peacock's Tail, Gold. Another that hath better observed, adds to shining Yellow, great Weight: And then the Sound Gold, when he uses it, stands for a complex _Idea_ of a shining Yellow, and very weighty Substance. Another adds to those Qualities, Fusibility: And then the Word Gold to him signifies, a Body, bright, yellow, fusible, and very heavy. Another adds Malleability. Each of these uses equally the Word Gold, when they have Occasion to express the _Idea,_ they have apply'd it to. But it is evident, that each can apply it only to his own _Idea_; nor can he make it stand, as a Sign of such a complex _Idea,_ as he has not.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But though Words, as they are used by Men, can properly and immediately signifie nothing but the _Ideas,_ that are in their Minds; yet they in their Thoughts, give them a secret reference to two other Things. _First, They suppose their Words to be Marks of the_ Ideas _in the Minds also of other Men, with whom they communicate_: For else they should talk in vain, and could not be understood, if the Sounds they applied to one _Idea,_ were such, as by the Hearer, were apply'd to another, which is to speak two Languages. But in this, Men stand not usually to examine, whether the _Idea_ they, and he they discourse with, be the same: But think it enough, that they use the Word, as they imagine, in the common Acceptation of that Language; in which case, they suppose that the _Idea,_ they make it a Sign of, is precisely the same, to which the Understanding Men of that Country apply that Name.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Secondly,_ Because _Men_ would not be thought to talk _barely_ of their own Imaginations, but of Things as really they are; therefore they _often suppose their Words to stand also for the Reality of Things._ But this relating more particularly to Substances, and their Names, as, perhaps, the former does to simple _Ideas_ and Modes, we shall speak of these two different ways of applying Words more at large, when we come to treat of the Names of mixed Modes, and Substances, in particular: Though give me leave here to say, that it is a perverting the use of Words, and brings unavoidable Obscurity and Confusion into their Signification, whenever we make them stand for any thing, but those _Ideas_ we have in our own Minds.","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Concerning Words also, this is farther to be considered. _First,_ That they being immediately the Signs of Men's _Ideas_; and by that means, the Instruments whereby Men communicate their Conceptions, and express to one another those Thoughts and Imaginations, they have within their own Breasts, _there comes by constant use,_ to be such _a Connexion between certain Sounds, and the_ Ideas _they stand for,_ that the Names heard, almost as readily excite certain _Ideas_; as if the Objects themselves, which are apt to produce them did actually affect the Senses. Which is manifestly so in all obvious sensible Qualities; and in all Substances, that frequently, and familiarly occurr to us.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Secondly,_ That though the proper and immediate Signification of Words, are _Ideas_ in the Mind of the Speaker; yet because by familiar use from our Cradles, we come to learn certain articulate Sounds very perfectly, and have them readily on our Tongues, and Memories, but yet are not always careful to examine, or settle their Significations perfectly, it _often_ happens, that _Men,_ even when they would apply themselves to an attentive Consideration, do _set their Thoughts more on Words than Things._ Nay, because Words are many of them learn'd, before the _Ideas_ are known for which they stand: Therefore some, not only Children, but Men, speak several Words, no otherwise than Parrots do, only because they have learn'd them, and have been accustomed to those Sounds. But so far as Words are of Use and Signification, so far is there a constant connexion between the Sound and the _Idea_; and a Designation, that the one stand for the other: without which Application of them, they are nothing, but so much insignificant Noise.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Words_ by long and familiar use, as has been said, come to excite in Men certain _Ideas_ so constantly and readily, that they are apt to suppose a natural connexion between them. But that they _signifie_ only Men's peculiar _Ideas,_ and that _by a perfectly arbitrary Imposition,_ is evident, in that they often fail to excite in others (even that use the same Language) the same _Ideas_ we take them to be the Signs of: And every Man has so inviolable a Liberty, to make Words stand for what _Ideas_ he pleases, that no one hath the Power to make others have the same _Ideas_ in their Minds, that he has, when they use the same Words, that he does. And therefore the great _Augustus_ himself, in the Possession of that Power, which ruled the World, acknowledged he could not make a new Latin Word: which was as much as to say, that he could not arbitrarily appoint, what _Idea_ any Sound should be a Sign of, in the Mouths and common Language of his Subjects. 'Tis true, common use, by a tacit Consent, appropriates certain Sounds to certain _Ideas_ in all Languages; which so far limits the signification of that Sound, that unless a Man applies it to the same _Idea,_ he cannot speak properly. And it is also true, that unless a Man's Words excite the same _Ideas_ in the Hearer, which he makes them stand for in speaking, he cannot speak intelligibly. But whatever be the consequences of his use of any Words, different either from the Publick, or that Person to whom he addresses them: This is certain, their signification in his use of them, is limited to his _Ideas,_ and they can be Signs of nothing else.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.3.2.8"}]}
