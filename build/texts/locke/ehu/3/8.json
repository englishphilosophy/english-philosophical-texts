This we see in the common use of Language, which permits _not any two abstract Words, or Names of abstract Ideas,_ to be _affirmed one of another._ For how near of kin soever they may seem to be, and how certain soever it is, that Man is an Animal, or rational, or white, yet every one, at first hearing, perceives the falshood of these Propositions; _Humanity is Animality,_ or _Rationality,_ or _Whiteness_: And this is as evident, as any of the most allow'd Maxims. All our Affirmations then are only in concrete, which is the affirming, not one abstract _Idea_ to be another, but one abstract _Idea_ be join'd to another; which abstract _Ideas,_ in Substances, may be of any sort; in all the rest, are little else but of Relations; and in Substances, the most frequent are of Powers; _v. g. a Man is white,_ signifies, that the thing that has the Essence of a Man, has also in it the Essence of Whiteness, which is nothing but a power to produce the _Idea_ of Whiteness in one, whose Eyes can discover ordinary Objects; or a Man is rational, signifies, that the same thing that hath the Essence of a Man, hath also in it the Essence of Rationality, _i. e._ a power of Reasoning.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.3.8.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This distinction of Names, shews us also the difference of our _Ideas_: For if we observe them, we shall find, that our _simple Ideas have all abstract, as well as concrete Names_: The one whereof is (to speak the Language of Grammarians) a Substantive, the other an Adjective; as Whiteness, White; Sweetness, Sweet. The like also holds in our _Ideas_ of _Modes_ and Relations; as Justice, Just; Equality, Equal; only with this difference, That some of the concrete Names of Relations, amongst Men chiefly, are Substantives; as _Paternitas, Pater_; whereof it were easie to render a Reason. But as to our _Ideas of Substances,_ we _have_ very few or _no abstract Names_ at all. For though the Schools have introduced _Animalitas, Humanitas, Corporietas,_ and some others; yet they hold no proportion with that infinite number of Names of Substances, to which they never were rediculous enough to attempt the coining of abstract ones: and those few that the Schools forged, and put into the mouths of their Scholars, could never yet get admittance into common use, or obtain the license of publick approbation. Which seems to me at least to intimate the confession of all Mankind, that they have no _Ideas_ of the real Essences of Substances, since they have not Names for such _Ideas_: which no doubt they would have had, had not their consciousness to themselves of their ignorance of them, kept them from so idle an attempt. And therefore though they had _Ideas_ enough to distinguish Gold from a Stone, and Metal from Wood; yet they but timerously ventured on such terms, as _Aurietas_ and _Saxietas, Metallietas_ and _Lignietas,_ or the like names, which should pretend to signifie the real Essences of those Substances, whereof they knew they had no _Idea._ And indeed, it was only the Doctrine of substantial Forms, and the confidence of shameless Pretenders to a knowledge that they had not, which first coined, and then introduced _Animalitas,_ and _Humanitas,_ and the like; which yet went very little farther than their own Schools, and could never get to be current amongst understanding Men. Indeed, _Humanitas_ was a Word, familiar amongst the _Romans_; but in a far different sense, and stood not for the abstract Essence of any Substance; but was the abstract Name of a Mode, and its concrete _Humanus,_ not _Homo._","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.3.8.2"}]}
