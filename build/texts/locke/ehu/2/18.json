Every articulate word is a different _modification of Sound_; by which we see, that from the sense of Hearing by such modifications, the Mind may be furnished with distinct _Ideas,_ to almost an infinite Number. Sounds also, besides the distinct cries of Birds and Beasts, are modified by diversity of Notes of different length put together, which make that complex _Idea_ call'd a Tune, which a Musician may have in his Mind, when he hears or makes no Sound at all, by reflecting on the _Ideas_ of those Sounds, so put together silently in his own Fancy.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.18.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Those of Colours might also be very various; some we take notice of as the different degrees, or as they are termed, _Shades of the same Colour_: But since we very seldom make assemblages of Colours, either for Use or Delight, but Figure is taken in also, and has its part in it, as in Painting, Weaving, Needle-works, _&c._ Those which are taken notice of, do most commonly belong to mixed Modes, as being made up of _Ideas_ of divers kinds, _viz._ Figure and Colour, such as Beauty, Rain bow, _&c._","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.2.18.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"All _compounded Tastes and Smells,_ are also Modes made up of these simple _Ideas_ of those Senses; but they being such as generally we have no names for, are less taken notice of, and cannot be set down in writing; and therefore must be left without enumeration, to the Thoughts and Experience of my Reader.","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.2.18.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In general it may be observed, that those _simple Modes which are considered but as different degrees of the same simple Idea_; though they are in themselves many of them very distinct _Ideas_; yet _have ordinarily no distinct Names,_ nor are much taken notice of as distinct _Ideas,_ where the difference is but very small between them. Whether Men have neglected these Modes, and given no Names to them, as wanting measures nicely to distinguish them, or because when they were so distinguished, that Knowledge would not be of general or necessary use, I leave it to the Thoughts of others; it is sufficient to my purpose to shew, that all these simple _Ideas,_ come to our Minds only by Sensation and Reflection; and that when the Mind has them, it can variously repeat and compound them, and so make new complex _Ideas._ But though White, Red, or Sweet, _&c._ have not been modified or made into complex _Ideas,_ by several Combinations, so as to be named, and thereby ranked into Species; yet some others of the simple _Ideas, viz._ those of Unity, Duration, Motion, _&c._ above instanced in, as also Power and Thinking have been thus modified to a great variety of complex _Ideas,_ with Names belonging to them.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.2.18.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_The Reason whereof,_ I suppose, has been this, That the great Concernment of Men being with Men one amongst another, the Knowledge of Men, and their Actions, and the signifying of them to one another, was most necessary; and therefore they made _Ideas_ of Actions very nicely modified, and gave those complex _Ideas_ names, that they might the more easily record and discourse of those things they were daily conversant in, without long Ambages and Circumlocutions; and that the things they were continually to give and receive information about, might be the easier and quicker understood. That this is so and that Men in framing different complex _Ideas,_ and giving them Names, have been much governed by the end of Speech in general (which is a very short and expedite way of conveying their Thoughts one to another) is evident in the Names, which in several Arts have been found out, and applied to several complex _Ideas_ of modified Actions, belonging to their several Trades, for dispatch sake, in their Direction or Discourses about them: Which _Ideas_ are not generally framed in the Minds of Men not conversant about these Operations; and thence the words that stand for them, by the greatest part of Men of the same Language, are not understood; _v. g. Coltsher, Drilling, Filtration, Cohobation,_ are words standing for certain complex _Ideas_; which being not in the Minds of every body, they having no use of them, those names of them are not generally understood but by Smiths, and Chimists; who having framed the complex _Ideas_ which these words stand for, and having given names to them, or received them from others upon hearing of these names in communication, readily conceive those _Ideas_ in their Minds; as by Cohobation all the simple _Ideas_ of Distilling, and the pouring the Liquor, distilled from any thing, back upon the remaining Matter, and distilling it again. Thus we see, that there are great varieties of simple _Ideas,_ as of Tastes and Smells, which have no Names, and of Modes many more; which either not having been generally enough observed, or else not being of any great use to be taken notice of in the Affairs and Converse of Men, they have not had names given to them, and so pass not for Species, which we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large, when we come to speak of Words.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.2.18.7"}]}
