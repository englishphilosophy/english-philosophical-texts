All Creatures naturally love their Offspring, whilst they are helpless, and so does Man: But in the Savage State Men are more liable to Accidents and Misfortunes, than they are in Society, as to the rearing of their young ones; and therefore the Children of Savages must very often be put to their Shifts, so as hardly to remember, by the time that they are grown up, that they had any Parents. If this happens too early, and they are dropt or lost, before they are four or five Years of Age, they must perish; either die for want, or be devour'd by Beasts of Prey, unless some other Creature takes care of them.

Self-preservation bids all Creatures gratify their Appetites, and that of propagating his Kind never fails to affect a Man in Health, many Years before he comes to his full Growth. If a wild Man and a wild Woman should meet very young, and live together for fifty Years undisturb'd, in a mild wholesome Climate, where there is plenty of Provisions, they might see a prodigious Number of Descendants: For in the wild State of Nature, Man multiplies his Kind much faster, than can be allow'd of in any regular Society: No Male at fourteen would be long without a Female, if he could get one; and no Female of Twelve would be refractory, if applied to; or remain long Uncourted, if there were Men.","subId":"29","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.29","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Considering, that Consanguinity would be no Bar among these People, the Progeny of two Savages might soon amount to Hundreds: All this I can grant you; but as Parents, no better qualify'd, could teach their Children but little, it would be impossible for them to govern these Sons and Daughters, when they grew up; if none of them had any Notions of Right or Wrong: and Society is as far off as ever; the false Principle, which you say all Men are born with, is an Obstacle never to be surmounted.","subId":"30","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.30","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From that false Principle, as you call it, the Right, Men naturally claim to every thing they can get, it must follow, that Man will look upon his Children as his Property, and make such use of them as is most consistent with his Interest.","subId":"31","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.31","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What is the Interest of a wild Man, that pursues nothing with Steadiness?","subId":"32","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.32","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Demand of the predominant Passion, for the time it lasts.","subId":"33","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.33","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That may change every Moment, and such Children would be miserably managed.","subId":"34","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.34","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That's true; but still managed they would be; I mean, they would be kept under, and forc'd to do as they were bid, at least till they were strong enough to resist. Natural Affection would prompt a wild Man to love, and cherish his Child; it would make him provide Food and other Necessaries for his Son, till he was ten or twelve Years old, or perhaps longer: But this Affection is not the only Passion, he has to gratify; if his Son provokes him by Stubborness, or doing otherwise than he would have him, this Love is suspended; and if his Displeasure be strong enough to raise his Anger, which is as natural to him as any other Passion, it is ten to one, but he'll knock him down: If he hurts him very much, and the Condition, he has put his Son in, moves his Pity, his Anger will cease; and, natural Affection returning, he'll fondle him again, and be sorry for what he has done. Now if we consider, that all Creatures hate and endeavour to avoid Pain, and that Benefits beget Love in all that receive them, we shall find, that the Consequence of this Management would be; that the Savage Child would learn to love and fear his Father: These two Passions, together with the Esteem, which we naturally have for every thing that far excels us, will seldom fail of producing that Compound, which we call Reverence.","subId":"35","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.35","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have it now; you have open'd my Eyes, and I see the Origin of Society, as plain as I do that Table.","subId":"36","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.36","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am afraid the Prospect is not so clear yet, as you imagine.","subId":"37","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.37","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Why so? The grand Obstacles are remov'd: Untaught Men, it is true, when they are grown up, are never to be govern'd; and our Subjection is never sincere, where the Superiority of the Governour is not very apparent: But both these are obviated; the Reverence we have for a Person, when we are young, is easily continued as long as we live; and where Authority is once acknowledg'd, and that Acknowledgment well establish'd, it cannot be a difficult Matter to govern. If thus a Man may keep up his Authority over his Children, he'll do it still with greater Ease over his Grand-Children: For a Child, that has the least Reverence for his Parents, will seldom refuse Homage to the Person, to whom he sees his Father pay it. Besides, a Man's Pride would be a sufficient Motive for him to maintain the Authority once gain'd; and, if some of his Progeny proved Refractory, he would leave no Stone unturn'd, by the help of the rest to reduce the Disobedient. The old Man being dead, the Authority from him would devolve upon the eldest of his Children, and so on.","subId":"38","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.38","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I thought you would go on too fast. If the wild Man had understood the Nature of Things, and been endued with general Knowledge, and a Language ready made, as _Adam_ was by Miracle, what you say, might have been easy; but an ignorant Creature, that knows nothing, but what his own Experience has taught him, is no more fit to govern, than he is fit to teach the Mathematicks.","subId":"39","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.39","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"He would not have above one or two Children to govern at first, and his Experience would encrease by degrees, as well as his Family: This would require no such consummate Knowledge.","subId":"40","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.40","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I don't say it would: An ordinary Capacity, of a Man tollerably well educated, would be sufficient to begin with; but a Man who never had been taught to curb any of his Passions, would be very unfit for such a Task. He would make his Children, as soon as they were able, assist him in getting Food, and teach them, how and where to procure it. Savage Children, as they got Strength, would endeavour to imitate every Action they saw their Parents do, and every Sound they heard them make; but all the Instructions they receiv'd would be confin'd to Things immediately necessary. Savage Parents would often take Offence at their Children, as they grew up, without a Cause; and as these encreas'd in Years, so natural Affection would decrease in the other. The Consequence would be, that the Children would often suffer for Failings that were not their own. Savages would often discover Faults in the Conduct of what was past; but they would not be able to establish Rules for future Behaviour, which they would approve of themselves for any Continuance; and Want of Foresight would be an inexhaustible Fund for Changes in their Resolutions. The Savage's Wife, as well as himself, would be highly pleas'd to see their Daughters impregnated, and bring forth; and they would both take great Delight in their Grand-Children.","subId":"41","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.41","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I thought, that in all Creatures the natural Affection of Parents had been confin'd to their own young ones.","subId":"42","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.42","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is so in all but Man; there is no Species but ours, that are so conceited of themselves, as to imagine every thing to be theirs. The Desire of Dominion is a never-failing Consequence of the Pride, that is common to all Men; and which the Brat of a Savage is as much born with, as the Son of an Emperour. This good Opinion, we have of ourselves, makes Men not only claim a Right to their Children, but likewise imagine, that they have a great Share of Jurisdiction over their Grand-Children. The young ones of other Animals, as soon as they can help themselves, are free; but the Authority, which Parents pretend to have over their Children, never ceases: How general and unreasonable this eternal Claim is naturally in the Heart of Man, we may learn from the Laws; which, to prevent the Usurpation of Parents, and rescue Children from their Dominion, every civil Society is forc'd to make; limiting paternal Authority to a certain Term of Years. Our Savage Pair would have a double Title to their Grand-Children, from their undoubted Property in each Parent of them; and all the Progeny being sprung from their own Sons and Daughters, without Intermixture of Foreign Blood, they would look upon the whole Race to be their natural Vassals; and I am persuaded, that the more Knowledge and Capacity of reasoning this first Couple acquired, the more just and unquestionable their Sovereignty over all their Descendants would appear to them, tho' they should live to see the fifth or sixth Generation.","subId":"43","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.43","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Is it not strange, that Nature should send us all into the World with a visible Desire after Government, and no Capacity for it at all?","subId":"44","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.44","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What seems strange to you, is an undeniable Instance of Divine Wisdom: For if all had not been born with this Desire, all must have been destitute of it; and Multitudes could never have been form'd into Societies, if some of them had not been possessed of this Thirst of Dominion. Creatures may commit Force upon themselves, they may learn to warp their natural Appetites, and divert them from their proper Objects; but peculiar Instincts, that belong to a whole Species, are never to be acquir'd by Art or Discipline; and those that are born without them, must remain destitute of them for ever.

What you have suggested to me, of his Unskilfulness, and want of Power to govern himself, has quite destroy'd all the Hopes I had conceiv'd of Society, from this Family.

The wildest Man, that can be conceiv'd, by the time that he came to Maturity, would be wise enough to know, that Fruits and other Eatables are not to be had, either always, or every where: This would naturally put him upon hoarding, when he had good Store: His Provision might be spoil'd by the Rain; he would see that Trees were blasted, and yielded not always the same Plenty: He might not always be in Health, or his young ones might grow sick, and die, without any Wounds or external Force to be seen. Some of these Accidents might at first escape his Attention, or only alarm his weak Understanding, without occasioning much Reflection for some Time; but as they came often, he would certainly begin to suspect some invisible Cause; and, as his Experience encreased, be confirm'd in his Suspicion. It is likewise highly probable, that a Variety of different Sufferings, would make him apprehend several such Causes; and at last induce him to believe, that there was a great Number of them, which he had to fear.

Every Art, and every Invention, as soon as we know them, are our Right and Property; and whatever we perform by the Assistance of them, is, by the Courtesy of the Species to itself, deem'd to be our own. We make Use of Fermentation, and all the Chymistry of Nature, without thinking ourselves beholden to any thing, but our own Knowledge. She that churns the Cream, makes the Butter; without enquiring into the Power, by which the thin lymphatick Particles are forced to separate themselves, and slide away from the more unctious. In brewing, baking, cooking, and almost every thing we have a Hand in, Nature is the Drudge, that makes all the Alterations, and does the principal Work; yet all, forsooth, is our own. From all which it is manifest; that Man, who is naturally for making every thing centre in himself, must, in his wild State, have a great Tendency, and be very prone to look upon every thing, he enjoys, as his due; and every thing he meddles with, as his own Performance. It requires Knowledge and Reflection; and a Man must be pretty far advanced in the Art of thinking justly, and reasoning consequentially, before he can, from his own Light, and without being taught, be sensible of his Obligations to God. The less a Man knows, and the more shallow his Understanding is, the less he is capable, either of enlarging his Prospect of Things, or drawing Consequences from the little which he does know. Raw, ignorant, and untaught Men, fix their Eyes on what is immediately before, and seldom look further than, as it is vulgarly express'd, the length of their Noses. The wild Man, if Gratitude moved him, would much sooner pay his Respects to the Tree, he gathers his Nuts from, than he would think of an Acknowledgment to him who had planted it; and there is no Property so well establish'd, but a civiliz'd Man would suspect his Title to it sooner, than a wild one would question the Sovereignty he has over his own Breath. Another Reason, why Fear is an elder Motive to Religion, than Gratitude, is, that an untaught Man would never suspect; that the same Cause, which he receiv'd Good from, would ever do him Hurt; and Evil, without doubt, would always gain his Attention first.","subId":"71","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.71","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Men, indeed, seem to remember one ill Turn, that is serv'd them, better than ten good ones; one Month's Sickness, better than ten Years Health.","subId":"72","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.72","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In all the Labours of Self-preservation, Man is intent on avoiding what is hurtful to him; but in the Enjoyment of what is pleasant, his Thoughts are relax'd, and he is void of Care: he can swallow a thousand Delights, one after another, without asking Questions; but the least Evil makes him inquisitive, whence it came, in order to shun it. It is very material, therefore, to know the Cause of Evil; but to know that of Good, which is always welcome, is of little Use; that is, such a Knowledge seems not to promise any Addition to his Happiness. When a Man once apprehends such an invisible Enemy, it is reasonable to think, that he would be glad to appease, and make him his Friend, if he could find him out; it is highly probable, likewise, that in order to this, he would search, investigate, and look every where about him; and that finding all his Enquiries upon Earth in vain, he would lift up his Eyes to the Sky.","subId":"73","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.73","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And so a wild Man might; and look down and up again, long enough, before he would be the wiser.

A wild Man and a wild Woman would not take less Care of their helpless Brood, than other Animals; and it is not to be imagin'd, but the Children that were brought up by them, tho' without Instruction or Discipline, would, before they were ten Years old, observe in their Parents this Fear of an invisible Cause: It is incredible likewise; considering, how much Men differ from one another in Features, Complexion, and Temper, that all should form the same Idea of this Cause; from whence it would follow, that as soon as any considerable Number of Men could intelligibly converse together, it would appear, that there were different Opinions among them, concerning the invisible Cause: The Fear and Acknowledgment of it being universal, and Man always attributing his own Passions to every thing, which he conceives to think, every body would be sollicitous to avoid the Hatred and Ill-will, and, if it was possible, to gain the Friendship of such a Power.

In the first place, there is no Difference between the original Nature of a Savage, and that of a civiliz'd Man: They are both born with Fear; and neither of them, if they have their Senses about them, can live many Years, but an invisible Power, will, at one Time or other, become the Object of that Fear; and this will happen to every Man, whether he be wild and alone, or in Society, and under the best Discipline.

At what time the Floral Games were first instituted, is not well known; but they never were celebrated every Year constantly, before a very unseasonable Spring put the Senate upon the Decree, that made them annual. To make up the true Compound of Reverence or Veneration, Love and Esteem are as necessary Ingredients as Fear; but the latter alone is capable of making Men counterfeit both the former; as is evident from the Duties, that are outwardly paid to Tyrants, at the same time that inwardly they are execrated and hated. Idolaters have always behaved themselves to every invisible Cause they adored, as Men do to a lawless arbitrary Power; when they reckon it as captious, haughty, and unreasonable, as they allow it to be sovereign, unlimited, and irresistible. What Motive could the frequent Repetitions of the same Solemnities spring from, whenever it was suspected, that the least holy Trifle had been omitted? You know, how often the same Farce was once acted over again, because after every Performance, there was still room to apprehend, that some thing had been neglected. Do but consult, I beg of you, and call to mind your own Reading; cast your Eyes on the infinite Variety of Ideas, Men have form'd to themselves, and the vast Multitude of Divisions they have made of the invisible Cause, which every one imagines to influence human Affairs: Run over the History of all Ages; look into every considerable Nation, their Streights and Calamities, as well as Victories and Successes; the Lives of great Generals, and other famous Men, their adverse Fortune and Prosperity: Mind at which times their Devotion was most fervent; when Oracles were most consulted, and on what Accounts the Gods were most frequently address'd.

The Word Religion itself, and the Fear of God, are synonimous; and had Man's Acknowledgment been originally founded in Love, as it is in Fear, the Craft of Impostors could have made no Advantage of the Passion; and all their boasted Acquaintance with Gods and Goddesses, would have been useless to them, if Men had worship'd the Immortal Powers, as they call'd their Idols, out of Gratitude.","subId":"79","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.79","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"All Lawgivers and Leaders of People gain'd their Point, and acquired what they expected from those Pretences, which is Reverence; and which to produce, you have own'd yourself, Love and Esteem to be as requisite as Fear.","subId":"80","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.80","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But from the Laws they imposed on Men, and the Punishments they annex'd to the Breach and Neglect of them, it is easily seen which of the Ingredients they most relied upon.","subId":"81","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.81","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It would be difficult to name a King, or other great Man in very ancient times, who attempted to govern any Infant Nation, that laid no Claim to some Commerce or other with an invisible Power, either held by himself or his Ancestors.

In the first place, a wild Man inured to Hardship, would far exceed a tame one, in all Feats of Strength, Nimbleness, and Activity: In the second, his Anger would sooner and more usefully transport and assist him in his savage State, than it can do in Society; where, from his Infancy, he is so many ways taught, and forced, in his own Defence, to cramp and stifle with his Fears the noble Gift of Nature. In wild Creatures we see, that most of them, when their own Life, or that of their young ones, is at Stake, fight with great Obstinacy, and continue fighting to the last, and do what Mischief they can, whilst they have Breath, without regard to their being overmatch'd, or the Disadvantages they labour under. It is observ'd likewise, that the more untaught and inconsiderate Creatures are, the more entirely they are sway'd by the Passion that is uppermost: Natural Affection would make wild Men, and Women too, sacrifice their Lives, and die for their Children; but they would die fighting; and one Wolf would not find it an easy Matter to carry off a Child from his watchful Parents, if they were both resolute, though they were naked. As to Man's being born defenceless, it is not to be conceiv'd, that he should long know the Strength of his Arms, without being acquainted with the Articulation of his Fingers, or at least, what is owing to it, his Faculty of grasping and holding fast; and the most untaught Savage would make Use of Clubs and Staves before he came to Maturity. As the Danger Men are in from wild Beasts would be of the highest Consequence, so it would employ their utmost Care and Industry: They would dig Holes, and invent other Stratagems, to distress their Enemies, and destroy their young ones: As soon as they found out Fire, they would make use of that Element to guard themselves and annoy their Foes: By the Help of it they would soon learn to sharpen Wood, which presently would put 'em upon making Spears and other Weapons that would cut. When Men are angry enough with Creatures to strike them, and these are running away, or flying from them, they are apt to throw at what they cannot reach: This, as soon as they had Spears, would naturally lead them to the Invention of Darts and Javelins. Here, perhaps, they might stop a while; but the same Chain of Thinking would, in Time, produce Bows and Arrows: The Elasticity of Sticks and Boughs of Trees is very obvious; and to make Strings of the Guts of Animals, I dare say, is more ancient than the Use of Hemp. Experience teaches us, that Men may have all these, and many more Weapons, and be very expert in the Use of them, before any manner of Government, except that of Parents over their Children, is to be seen among them: It is likewise very well known, that Savages furnish'd with no better Arms, when they are strong enough in Number, will venture to attack, and even hunt after the fiercest wild Beasts, Lions and Tygers not excepted. Another thing is to be consider'd, that likewise favours our Species, and relates to the Nature of the Creatures, of which in temperate Climates Man has Reason to stand in bodily fear of.","subId":"177","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.177","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Wolves and wild Boars?","subId":"178","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.178","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Yes.

This alone would make us another World; and Mankind could never have known that most necessary and now inexhaustible Spring, from which all Nations, where Slaves are not allow'd of, are constantly supply'd with willing Hands for all the Drudgery of hard and dirty Labour; I mean the Children of the Poor, the greatest and most extensive of all temporal Blessings that accrue from Society, on which all the Comforts of Life, in the civilis'd State, have their unavoidable dependance. There are many other things, from which it is plain, that such a real Love of Man for his Species would have been altogether inconsistent with the present Scheme; the World must have been destitute of all that Industry, that is owing to Envy and Emulation; no Society could have been easy with being a flourishing People, at the Expence of their Neighbours, or enduring to be counted a formidable Nation. All Men would have been Levellers, Government would have been unnecessary, and there could have been no great Bustle in the World. Look into the Men of greatest Renown, and the most celebrated Atchievements of Antiquity, and every thing that has been cried up, and admired in past Ages, by the fashionable part of Mankind: If the same Labours were to be perform'd over again, which Qualification, which help of Nature do you think, would be the most proper means to have them executed; that Instinct of real Affection, you required, without Ambition or the Love of Glory; or a stanch Principle of Pride and Selfishness, acting under Pretence to, and assuming the Resemblance of, that Affection? Consider, I beseech you, that no Men governed by this Instinct would require Services of any of their Species, which they would not be ready to perform for others; and you will easily see, that its being universal would quite alter the Scene of Society from what it is now. Such an Instinct might be very suitable to another Scheme different from this, in another World; where instead of Fickleness, and a restless desire after Changes and Novelty, there was observ'd an universal Steadiness continually preserv'd by a serene Spirit of Contentment, among other Creatures of different Appetites from ours, that had Frugality without Avarice, and Generosity without Pride; and whose Sollicitude after Happiness in a future State, was as active and apparent in Life, as our Pursuits are after the Enjoyments of this present. But as to the World we live in, examine into the various ways of earthly Greatness, and all the Engines that are made use of to attain to the Felicity of carnal Men, and you'll find, that the Instinct you speak of, must have destroy'd the Principles, and prevented the very Existence of that Pomp and Glory, to which human Societies have been, and are still raised by worldly Wisdom.","subId":"237","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.237","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I give up my affectionate Scheme; you have convinced me, that there could not have been that Stir and Variety, nor, upon the whole, that Beauty in the World, which there have been, if all Men had been naturally Humble, Good, and Virtuous.

That there are wild Beasts, and that there are savage Men, is certain; and that where there are but few of the latter, the first must always be very troublesome, and often fatal to them, is as certain; and when I reflect on the Passions, all Men are born with, and their Incapacity, whilst they are untaught; I can find no Cause or Motive, which is so likely to unite them together, and make them espouse the same Interest, as that common Danger they must always be in from wild Beasts, in uncultivated Countries; whilst they live in small Families, that all shift for themselves, without Government or Dependance upon one another: This first Step to Society, I believe to be an Effect, which that same Cause, the common Danger so often mentioned, will never fail to produce upon our Species in such Circumstances: What other, and how many Purposes wild Beasts might have been design'd for besides, I don't pretend to determine, as I have told you before.","subId":"239","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.239","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But whatever other Purposes wild Beasts were design'd for, it still follows from your Opinion, that the uniting of Savages in common Defence, must have been one; which to me seems clashing with our Idea of the Divine Goodness.","subId":"240","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.240","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"So will every thing seem to do, which we call Natural Evil; if you ascribe human Passions to the Deity, and measure infinite Wisdom by the Standard of our most shallow Capacity: You have been at this twice already; I thought I had answer'd it.

As there can be no Effect without a Cause, so nothing can be said to happen by Chance, but in respect to him who is ignorant of the Cause of it. I can make this evident to you, in an obvious and familiar Example. To a Man, who knows nothing of the Tennis-Court, the Skips and Rebounds of the Ball seem to be all fortuitous; as he is not able to guess at the several different Directions it will receive, before it comes to the Ground; so, as soon as it has hit the Place, to which it was plainly directed at first, it is Chance to him where it will fall: whereas the experienced Player, knowing perfectly well the Journey the Ball will make, goes directly to the Place, if he is not there already, where it will certainly come within his Reach. Nothing seems to be more the Effect of Chance than a Cast of the Dice: yet they obey the Laws of Gravity and Motion in general, as much as any thing else; and from the Impressions that are given them, it is impossible they should fall otherwise than they do: but the various Directions which they shall receive in the whole Course of the Throw being entirely unknown, and the Rapidity with which they change their Situation being such, that our slow Apprehension cannot trace them, what the Cast will be is a Mystery to human Understanding, at fair Play. But if the same Variety of Directions was given to two Cubes of ten Feet each, which a Pair of Dice receive as well from one another as the Box, the Caster's Fingers that cover it, and the Table they are flung upon, from the time they are taken up 'till they lye still, the same Effect would follow; and if the Quantity of Motion, the Force that is imparted to the Box and Dice was exactly known, and the Motion itself was so much retarded in the Performance, that what is done in three or four seconds, should take up an Hour's time, it would be easy to find out the Reason of every Throw, and Men might learn with Certainty to foretell which Side of the Cube would be uppermost. It is evident then, that the Words _fortuitous_ and _casual,_ have no other meaning, than what depends upon our want of Knowledge, Foresight and Penetration; the Reflection on which will shew us, by what an Infinity of Degrees all human Capacity falls short of that universal _intuitus,_ with which the supreme Being beholds at once every thing without Exception, whether to us it be visible or invisible, past, present, or to come.","subId":"241","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.241","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I yield: You have solved every Difficulty I have been able to raise; and I must confess, that your Supposition concerning the first Motive, that would make Savages associate, is neither clashing with good Sense, nor any Idea we ought to have of the Divine Attributes; but on the contrary, in answering my Objections, you have demonstrated the Probability of your Conjecture, and rendred the Wisdom and Power of Providence, in the Scheme of this Earth, both as to the Contrivance and the Execution of it, more conspicuous and palpable to me, than any thing I ever heard or read, had done before.","subId":"242","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.242","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am glad you are satisfied; tho' far from arrogating to my self so much Merit as your Civility would compliment me with.","subId":"243","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.243","speaker":"Cleo"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is very clear to me now; that as it is appointed for all Men to die, so it is necessary there should be Means to compass this End; that from the Number of those Means, or Causes of Death, it is impossible to exclude either the Malice of Men, or the Rage of wild Beasts, and all noxious Animals; and that, if they had been actually design'd by Nature, and contriv'd for that Purpose, we should have no more Reason justly to complain of them, than we have to find fault with Death itself, or that frightful Train of Diseases, which are daily and hourly the manifest occasion of it.","subId":"244","id":"Mandeville.P2.5.244","speaker":"Hor"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"They are all equally included in the Curse, which after the _Fall_ was deservedly pronounc'd against the whole Earth; and if they be real Evils, they are to be look'd upon as the Consequence of Sin, and a condign Punishment, which the Transgression of our first Parents has drawn and entail'd upon all their Posterity.
