But if the Word _Knave_ may be understood in its full Latitude, and comprehend every Body that is not sincerely honest, and does to others what he would dislike to have done to himself, I don't question but I shall make good the Charge. To pass by the innumerable Artifices, by which Buyers and Sellers out-wit one another, that are daily allowed of and practised among the fairest of _Dealers,_ shew me the _Tradesman_ that has always discover'd the Defects of his Goods to those that cheapen'd them; nay, where will you find one that has not at one time or other industriously conceal'd them, to the detriment of the _Buyer?_ Where is the Merchant that has never against his Conscience extoll'd his Wares beyond their Worth, to make them go off the better?","subId":"1","id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem.B.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Decio,_ a Man of great Figure, that had large Commissions for Sugar from several Parts beyond Sea, treats about a considerable parcel of that Commodity with _Alcander_ an eminent _West-India_ Merchant; both understood the Market very well, but could not agree: _Decio_ was a Man of Substance, and thought no body ought to buy cheaper than himself; _Alcander_ was the same, and not wanting Money, stood for his Price. While they were driving their Bargain at a Tavern near the _Exchange, Alcander_'s Man brought his Master a Letter from the _West-Indies,_ that inform'd him of a much greater quantity of Sugars coming for _England_ than was expected. _Alcander_ now wish'd for nothing more than to sell at _Decio_'s Price, before the News was publick; but being a cunning Fox, that he might not seem too precipitant, nor yet lose his Customer, he drops the Discourse they were upon, and putting on a Jovial Humour, commends the Agreeableness of the Weather, from whence falling upon the Delight he took in his Gardens, invites _Decio_ to go along with him to his Country-House, that was not above Twelve Miles from _London._ It was in the Month of _May,_ and, as it happened, upon a _Saturday_ in the Afternoon: _Decio,_ who was a single Man, and would have no Business in Town before _Tuesday,_ accepts of the other's Civility, and away they go in _Alcander_'s Coach. _Decio_ was splendidly entertain'd that Night and the Day following; the _Monday_ Morning, to get himself an Appetite, he goes to take the Air upon a Pad of _Alcander_'s, and coming back meets with a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, who tells him News was come the Night before that the _Barbadoes_ Fleet was destroy'd by a Storm, and adds, that before he came out it had been confirm'd at _Lloyd_'s Coffee-House, where it was thought Sugars would rise 25 _per Cent._ by Change-time. _Decio_ returns to his Friend, and immediately resumes the Discourse they had broke off at the Tavern: _Alcander_, who thinking himself sure of his Chap, did not design to have moved it till after Dinner, was very glad to see himself so happily prev-ented ; but how desirous soever he was to sell, the other was yet more eager to buy; yet both of them afraid of one another, for a considerable time counterfeited all the Indifference imaginable; 'till at last _Decio_ fired with what he had heard, thought Delays might prove dangerous, and throwing a Guinea upon the Table, struck the Bargain at _Alcander_'s Price. The next Day they went to _London;_ the News prov'd true, and _Decio_ got Five Hundred Pounds by his Sugars. _Alcander,_ whilst he had strove to over-reach the other, was paid in his own Coin: yet all this is called fair dealing; but I am sure neither of them would have desired to be done by, as they did to each other.","subId":"2","id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem.B.2"}]}
