Our ancestors in ^Europe^, before the revival of letters, believed, as we do at present, that there was one supreme God, the author of nature, whose power, though in itself uncontroulable, was yet often exerted by the interposition of his angels and subordinate ministers, who executed his sacred purposes. But they also believed, that all nature was full of other invisible powers; fairies, goblins, elves, sprights; beings, stronger and mightier than men, but much inferior to the celestial natures, who surround the throne of God. Now, suppose, that any one, in those ages, had denied the existence of God and of his angels; would not his impiety justly have deserved the appellation of atheism, even though he had still allowed, by some odd capricious reasoning, that the popular stories of elves and fairies were just and well-grounded? The difference, on the one hand, between such a person and a genuine theist is infinitely greater than that, on the other, between him and one that absolutely excludes all invisible intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely from the casual resemblance of names, without any conformity of meaning, to rank such opposite opinions under the same denomination.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.1","pages":"44"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To any one, who considers justly of the matter, it will appear, that the gods of all polytheists are no better than the elves or fairies of our ancestors, and merit as little any pious worship or veneration. These pretended religionists are really a kind of superstitious atheists, and acknowledge no being, that corresponds to our idea of a deity. No first principle of mind or thought: No supreme government and administration: No divine contrivance or intention in the fabric of the world.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.2","pages":"44"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The ^Chinese^, when[n6] their prayers are not answered, beat their idols. The deities of the ^Laplanders^ are any large stone which they meet with of an extraordinary shape[n7]. The ^Egyptian^ mythologists, in order to account for animal worship, said, that the gods, pursued by the violence of earth-born men, who were their enemies, had formerly been obliged to disguise themselves under the semblance of beasts[n8]. The ^Caunii^, a nation in the Lesser ^Asia^, resolving to admit no strange gods among them, regularly, at certain seasons, assembled themselves compleatly armed, beat the air with their lances, and proceeded in that manner to their frontiers; in order, as they said, to expel the foreign deities[n9]. _Not even the immortal gods,_ said some ^German^ nations to ^C{ae}sar^, _are a match for the ^Suevi^[n10]._","subId":"3","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.3","pages":"45"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Many ills, says ^Dione^ in ^Homer^ to ^Venus^ wounded by ^Diomede^, many ills, my daughter, have the gods inflicted on men: And many ills, in return, have men inflicted on the gods[n11].

But these writers do not consider, that the ludicrous, familiar images, under which the gods are represented by that comic poet, instead of appearing impious, were the genuine lights in which the ancients conceived their divinities. What conduct can be more criminal or mean, than that of ^Jupiter^ in the ^Amphitrion^? Yet that play, which represented his gallante exploits, was supposed so agreeable to him, that it was always acted in ^Rome^ by public authority, when the state was threatened with pestilence, famine, or any general calamity[n14]. The ^Romans^ supposed, that, like all old letchers, he would be highly pleased with the recital of his former feats of prowess and vigour, and that no topic was so proper, upon which to flatter his vanity.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.5","pages":"45"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The ^Lacedemonians^, says ^Xenophon^[n15], always, during war, put up their petitions very early in the morning, in order to be beforehand with their enemies, and, by being the first solicitors, pre-engage the gods in their |favour. We may gather from ^Seneca^[n16], that it was usual, for the votaries in the temples, to make interest with the beadle or sexton, that they might have a seat near the image of the deity, in order to be the best heard in their prayers and applications to him. The ^Tyrians^, when besieged by ^Alexander^, threw chains on the statue of ^Hercules^, to prevent that deity from deserting to the enemy[n17]. ^Augustus^, having twice lost his fleet by storms, forbad ^Neptune^ to be carried in procession along with the other gods; and fancied, that he had sufficiently revenged himself by that expedient[n18]. After ^Germanicus^'s death, the people were so enraged at their gods, that they stoned them in their temples; and openly renounced all allegiance to them[n19].","subId":"6","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.6","pages":"45-6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To ascribe the origin and fabric of the universe to these imperfect beings never enters into the imagination of any polytheist or idolater. ^Hesiod^, whose writings, with those of ^Homer^, contained the canonical system of the heathens[n20]; ^Hesiod^, I say, supposes gods and men to have sprung equally from the unknown powers of nature[n21]. And throughout the whole theogony of that author, ^Pandora^ is the only instance of creation or a voluntary production; and she too was formed by the gods merely from despight to ^Prometheus^, who had furnished men with stolen fire from the celestial regions[n22].

The philosophers alone made profession of delivering systems of this kind; and it was pretty late too before these bethought themselves of having recourse to a mind or supreme intelligence, as the first cause of all. So far was it from being esteemed profane in those days to account for the origin of things without a deity, that ^Thales^, ^Anaximenes^, ^Heraclitus^, and others, who embraced that system of cosmogony, past unquestioned; while ^Anaxagoras^, the first undoubted theist among the philosophers, was perhaps the first that ever was accused of atheism[n27].","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.4.10","pages":"47"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We are told by ^Sextus Empiricus^[n28], that ^Epicurus^, when a boy, reading with his preceptor these verses of ^Hesiod^, \"\"Eldest of beings, _chaos_ first arose;// Next _earth_, wide-stretch'd, the _seat_ of all:\"\" |the young scholar first betrayed his inquisitive genius, by asking, _And chaos whence?_ But was told by his preceptor, that he must have recourse to the philosophers for a solution of such questions.
