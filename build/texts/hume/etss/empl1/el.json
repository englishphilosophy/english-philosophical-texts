It may, however, be observed, that, in _civil_ history, there is found a much greater uniformity than in the history of learning and science, and that the wars, negociations, and politics of one age resemble more those of another, than the taste, wit, and speculative principles. Interest and ambition, honour and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in all public transactions; and these passions are of a very stubborn and intractable nature, |in comparison of the sentiments and understanding, which are easily varied by education and example.

It is observable, that the ancient critics could scarcely find two orators in any age, who deserved to be placed precisely in the same rank, and possessed the same degree of merit. ^Calvus^, ^C{ae}lius^, ^Curio^, ^Hortensius^, ^C{ae}sar^ rose one above another: But the greatest of that age was inferior to ^Cicero^, the most eloquent speaker, that had ever appeared in ^Rome^. Those of fine taste, however, pronounced this judgment of the ^Roman^ orator, as well as of the ^Grecian^, that both of them surpassed in eloquence all that had ever appeared, but that they were far from reaching the perfection of their art, which was infinite, and not only exceeded human force to attain, but human imagination to conceive. ^Cicero^ declares himself dissatisfied with his own performances; nay, even with those of ^Demosthenes^. _Ita sunt avid{ae} & capaces me{ae} aures,_ says he, _& semper aliquid immensum, infinitumque desiderant._","subId":"3","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.3","pages":"98"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of all the polite and learned nations, ^England^ alone possesses a popular government, or admits into the legislature such numerous assemblies as can be supposed to lie under the dominion of eloquence.

Or where are the monuments of their genius to be met with? There are found, indeed, in our histories, the names of several, who directed the resolutions of our parliament: But neither themselves nor others have taken the pains to preserve their speeches; and the authority, which they possessed, seems to have been owing to their experience, wisdom, or power, more than to their talents for oratory. At present, there are above half a dozen speakers in the two houses, who, in the judgment of the public, have reached very near the same pitch of eloquence; and no man pretends to give any one the preference above the rest. This seems to me a certain proof, that none of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art, and that the species of eloquence, which they aspire to, gives no exercise to the sublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached by ordinary talents and a slight application.

I swear by the_ manes _of those heroes, who fought for the same cause in the plains of ^Marathon^ and ^Plat{ae}a^._ Who could now endure such a bold and poetical figure, as that which ^Cicero^ employs, after describing in the most tragical terms the crucifixion of a ^Roman^ citizen. _Should I paint the horrors of this scene, not to ^Roman^ citizens, not to the allies of our state, not to those who have ever heard of the ^Roman^ Name, not even to men, but to brute-|creatures; or, to go farther, should I lift up my voice in the most desolate solitude, to the rocks and mountains, yet should I surely see those rude and inanimate parts of nature moved with horror and indignation at the recital of so enormous an action_[n2]. With what a blaze of eloquence must such a sentence be surrounded to give it grace, or cause it to make any impression on the hearers? And what noble art and sublime talents are requisite to arrive, by just degrees, at a sentiment so bold and excessive: To inflame the audience, so as to make them accompany the speaker in such violent passions, and such elevated conceptions: And to conceal, under a torrent of eloquence, the artifice, by which all this is effectuated! Should this sentiment even appear to us excessive, as perhaps it justly may, it will at least serve to give an idea of the stile of ancient eloquence, where such swelling expressions were not rejected as wholly monstrous and gigantic.","subId":"6","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.6","pages":"100-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Suitable to this vehemence of thought and expression, was the vehemence of action, observed in the ancient orators.

The study of the laws was not then a laborious occupation, requiring the drudgery of a whole life to finish it, and incompatible with every other study or profession. The great statesmen and generals among the ^Romans^ were all lawyers; and ^Cicero^, to shew the facility of acquiring this science, declares, that, in the midst of all his occupations, he would undertake, in a few days, to make himself a complete civilian. Now, where a pleader addresses himself to the equity of his judges, he has much more room to display his eloquence, than where he must draw his arguments from strict laws, statutes, and precedents. In the former case, many circumstances must be taken in; many personal considerations regarded; and even favour and inclination, which it belongs to the orator, by his art and eloquence, to conciliate, may be disguised under the appearance of equity. But how shall a modern lawyer have leisure to quit his toilsome oc|cupations, in order to gather the flowers of ^Parnassus^? Or what opportunity shall he have of displaying them, amidst the rigid and subtile arguments, objections, and replies, which he is obliged to make use of? The greatest genius, and greatest orator, who should pretend to plead before the _Chancellor_, after a month's study of the laws, would only labour to make himself ridiculous.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.10","pages":"102-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am ready to own, that this circumstance, of the multiplicity and intricacy of laws, is a discouragement to eloquence in modern times: But I assert, that it will not entirely account for the decline of that noble art.

Among the ^Athenians^, the ^Areopagites^ expressly forbad all allurements of eloquence; and some have pretended that in the ^Greek^ orations, written in the _judiciary_ form, there is not so bold and rhetorical a stile, as appears in the ^Roman^. But to what a pitch did the ^Athenians^ carry their eloquence in the _deliberative_ kind, when affairs of state were canvassed, and the liberty, happiness, and honour of the republic were the subject of debate?

It would be ridiculous to describe, in strong colours, the horror and cruelty of the action: To introduce the relations of the dead; and, at a signal, make them throw themselves at the feet of the judges, imploring justice with tears and lamentations: And still more ridiculous would it be, to employ a picture representing the bloody deed, in order to move the judges by the display of so tragical a spectacle: Though we know, that this artifice was sometimes practised by the pleaders of old[n4] Now, banish the pathetic from public discourses, and you reduce the speakers merely to modern eloquence; that is, to good sense, delivered in proper expression.","subId":"12","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.12","pages":"103-4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Perhaps it may be acknowledged, that our modern customs, or our superior good sense, if you will, should make our orators more cautious and reserved than the ancient, in attempting to inflame the passions, or elevate the imagination of their audience: But, I see no reason, why it should make them despair absolutely of succeeding in that attempt. It should make them redouble their art, not abandon it entirely. The ancient orators seem also to have been on their guard against this jealousy of their audience; but they took a different way of eluding it[n5]. They hurried away with such a torrent of sublime and pathetic, that they left their hearers no leisure to perceive the artifice, by which they were deceived. Nay, to consider the matter aright, they were not deceived by any artifice.

The ^Grecian^ addressed himself to an audience much less refined than the ^Roman^ senate or judges. The lowest vulgar of ^Athens^ were his sovereigns, and the arbiters of his eloquence[n6]. Yet is his manner more chaste and austere than that of the other. Could it be copied, its success would be infallible over a modern assembly.

A few successful attempts of this nature might rouze the genius of the nation, excite the emulation of the youth, and accustom our ears to a more sublime and more pathetic elocution, than what we have been hitherto entertained with. There is certainly something accidental in the first rise and the progress of the arts in any nation. I doubt whether a very satisfactory reason can be given, why ancient ^Rome^, though it received all its refinements from ^Greece^, could attain only to a relish for statuary, painting and architecture, without reaching the practice of these arts: While modern ^Rome^ has been excited, by a few remains found among the ruins of antiquity, and has produced artists of the greatest eminence and distinction. Had such a cultivated genius for oratory, as ^Waller^'s for poetry, arisen, during the civil wars, when liberty began to be fully established, and popular assemblies to enter into all the most material points of govern|ment; I am persuaded so illustrious an example would have given a quite different turn to ^British^ eloquence, and made us reach the perfection of the ancient model. Our orators would then have done honour to their country, as well as our poets, geometers, and philosophers, and ^British Ciceros^ have appeared, as well as ^British Archimedeses^ and ^Virgils^.","subId":"17","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.17","pages":"106-7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is seldom or never found, when a false taste in poetry or eloquence prevails among any people, that it has been preferred to a true, upon comparison and reflection. It commonly prevails merely from ignorance of the true, and from the want of perfect models, to lead men into a juster apprehension, and more refined relish of those productions of genius. When _these_ appear, they soon unite all suffrages in their favour, and, by their natural and powerful charms, gain over, even the most prejudiced, to the love and admiration of them. The principles of every passion, and of every sentiment, is in every man; and when touched properly, they rise to life, and warm the heart, and convey that satisfaction, by which a work of genius is distinguished from the adulterate beauties of a capricious wit and fancy. And if this observation be true, with regard to all the liberal arts, it must be peculiarly so, with regard to eloquence; which, being merely calculated for the public, and for men of the world, cannot, with any pretence of reason, appeal from the people to more refined judges; but must submit to the public verdict, without reserve or limitation. Whoever, upon comparison, is deemed by a common audience the greatest orator, ought most certainly to be pronounced such, by men of science and erudition. And though an indifferent speaker may triumph for a long time, and be esteemed altogether perfect by the vulgar, who are satisfied with his accomplishments, and know not in what he is defective: Yet, whenever the true genius arises, _he_ draws to him the attention of every one, and immediately appears superior to his rival.","subId":"18","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.El.18","pages":"107"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now to judge by this rule, ancient eloquence, that is, the sublime and passionate, is of a much juster taste than the modern, or the argumentative and rational; and, if properly executed, will always have more command and authority over mankind. We are satisfied with our mediocrity, because we have had no experience of any thing better: But the ancients had experience of both, and, upon comparison, gave the preference to that kind, of which they have left us such applauded models. For, if I mistake not, our modern eloquence is of the same stile or species with that which ancient critics denominated ^Attic^ eloquence, that is, calm, elegant, and subtile, which instructed the reason more than affected the passions, and never raised its tone above argument or common discourse. Such was the eloquence of ^Lysias^ among the ^Athenians^, and of ^Calvus^ among the ^Romans^. These were esteemed in their time; but when compared with ^Demosthenes^ and ^Cicero^, were eclipsed like a taper when set in the rays of a meridian sun.

It is there seconded by the graces of |voice and action: The movements are mutually communicated between the orator and the audience: And the very aspect of a large assembly, attentive to the discourse of one man, must inspire him with a peculiar elevation, sufficient to give a propriety to the strongest figures and expressions.

But where is the necessity of falling into this absurdity? A public speaker must know beforehand the question under debate. He may compose all the arguments, objections, and answers, such as he thinks will be most proper for his discourse[n7]. If any thing new occur, he may supply it from his invention; nor will the difference be very apparent between his elaborate and his extemporary compositions.

Their great affectation of extemporary discourses has made them reject all order and method, which seems so requisite to argument, and without which it is scarcely possible to produce an entire |conviction on the mind.
