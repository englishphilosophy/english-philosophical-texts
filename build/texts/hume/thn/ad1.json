The reader must only observe, that all the subjects I have there plann'd out to myself, are not treated of in these two volumes. The subjects of the _understanding_ and _passions_ make a compleat chain of reasoning by themselves; and I was willing to take advantage of this natural division, in order to try the taste of the public. If I have the good fortune to meet with success, I shall proceed to the examination of _morals_, _politics_, and _criticism_; which will compleat this _Treatise of human nature_. The approbation of the public I consider as the greatest reward of my labours; but am determin'd to regard its judgment, whatever it be, as my best instruction._","subId":"1","id":"Hume.THN.Ad1.1","pages":"xii"}]}
