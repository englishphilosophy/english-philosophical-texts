How do they make us _happy_, or prove _good_ to us? No otherwise than as they supply Gratifications to our _Senses_ or Facultys of perceiving Pleasure. Now, are these _Senses_ or Facultys only the _external ones_? No: Every body sees, that a small portion of _Wealth_ or _Power_ will supply more Pleasures of the _external Senses_ than we can enjoy; we know that Scarcity often heightens these Perceptions more than Abundance, which cloys that Appetite which is necessary to all Pleasure in Enjoyment: and hence the _Poet_'s Advice is perfectly just; \"\"$——— Tu pulmentaria quaere Sudando ———$[n1]\"\" In short, the only use of a great Fortune above a very small one (except in _good Offices_ and _moral Pleasures_) must be to supply us with the Pleasures of _Beauty_, _Order_, and _Harmony_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^It^ is true indeed, that the noblest Pleasures of the _internal Senses_, in the Contemplation of the Works of _Nature_, are expos'd to every one without Expence; the _Poor_ and the _Low_, may have as free Use of these Objects, in this way, as the _Wealthy_ or _Powerful_. And even in Objects which may be appropriated, the _Property_ is of little Consequence to the Enjoyment of their Beauty, which is often enjoy'd by others beside the _Proprietor_. But then there are other Objects of these _internal Senses_, which require _Wealth_ or _Power_ to procure the use of them as frequently as we desire; as appears in _Architecture_, _Musick_, _Gardening_, _Painting_, _Dress_, _Equipage_, _Furniture_; of which we cannot have the full Enjoyment without _Property_. And there are some confus'd _Imaginations_, which often lead us to pursue _Property_, even in Objects where it is not necessary to the true Enjoyment of them. These are the _ultimate Motives_ of our pursuing the greater Degrees of _Wealth_, where there are no generous Intentions of virtuous Actions.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^This^ is confirm'd by the constant Practice of the very Enemys to these _Senses_. As soon as they think they are got above the _World_, or extricated from the Hurrys of _Avarice_ and _Ambition_; banish'd _Nature_ will return upon them, and set them upon Pursuits of _Beauty_ and _Order_ in their _Houses_, _Gardens_, _Dress_, _Table_, _Equipage_. They are never easy without some degree of this; and were their Hearts open to our View, we should see _Regularity_, _Decency_, _Beauty_, as what their Wishes terminate upon, either to themselves or to their Posterity; and what their Imagination is always presenting to them as the possible Effects of their Labours. Nor without this could they ever justify their Pursuits to themselves.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^There^ may perhaps be some Instances of human Nature perverted into a thorow _Miser_, who loves nothing but Money, and whose Fancy arises no higher than the cold dull Thought of Possession; but such an Instance in an Age, must not be made the Standard of Mankind against the whole Body.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^If^ we examine the Pursuits of the _Luxurious_, who is imagin'd wholly devoted to his Belly; we shall generally find that the far greater part of his Expence is employ'd to procure other Sensations than those of Taste; such as fine _Attendants_, _regular Apartments_, _Services of Plate_, and the like. Besides, a large share of the Preparation must be suppos'd design'd for some sort of generous friendly Purposes, to please _Acquaintance_, _Strangers_, _Parasites_. How few would be contented to enjoy the same Sensations alone, in a Cottage, or out of earthen Pitchers? To conclude this Point, however these _internal Sensations_ may be overlook'd in our Philosophical Inquirys about the human Facultys, we shall find in Fact, \"That they employ us more, and are more efficacious in _Life_, either to our _Pleasure_, or _Uneasiness_, than all our _external Senses_ taken together.\"","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Final Cause of the internal Senses.# ^As^ to the _final Causes_ of this _internal Sense_, we need not enquire, \"whether, to an _Almighty_, and _All-knowing Being_, there be any real Excellence in _regular Forms_, in acting by _general Laws_, in knowing by _Theorems_?\" We seem scarce capable of answering such Questions any way; nor need we enquire, \"Whether other Animals may not discern _Uniformity_ and _Regularity_ in Objects which escape our Observation, and may not perhaps have their Senses constituted so as to perceive _Beauty_ from the same Foundation which we do, in Objects which our Senses are not fit to examine or compare?\" We shall confine our selves to a Subject where we have some certain Foundation to go upon, and only inquire, \"if we can find any Reasons worthy of the great ^Author^ of _Nature_, for making such a Connection between regular Objects, and the Pleasure which accompanys our Perceptions of them; or, what Reasons might possibly influence him to create the _World_, as it at present is, as far as we can observe, every-where full of _Regularity_ and _Uniformity_?\"","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Let^ it be here observ'd, that as far as we know concerning any of the great Bodys of the _Universe_, we see Forms and Motions really _beautiful_ to our Senses; and if we were plac'd in any _Planet_, the _apparent Courses_ would still be _regular_ and _uniform_, and consequently =beautiful= to us.

And possibly, the ^Deity^ could have form'd us so as to have receiv'd no Pleasure from such Objects, or connected Pleasure to those of a quite contrary Nature. We have a tolerable Presumption of this in the _Beautys_ of various Animals; they give some small Pleasure indeed to every one who views them, but then every one seems far more delighted with the peculiar _Beautys_ of its own _Species_, than with those of a different one, which seldom raise any Desire[n2]. This makes it probable, that the _Pleasure_ is not the necessary Result of the _Form_ it self, otherwise it would equally affect all Apprehensions in what Species soever; but depends upon a voluntary _Constitution_, adapted to preserve the _Regularity_ of the _Universe_, and is probably not the Effect of _Necessity_, but _Choice_, in the ^Supreme Agent^, who constituted our _Senses_.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#From the divine Goodness.# ^Now^ from the whole we may conclude, \"That supposing the ^Deity^ so kind as to connect _sensible Pleasure_ with certain Actions or Contemplations, beside the _rational Advantage_ perceivable in them; there is a great _moral Necessity_, from his _Goodness_, that the _internal Sense_ of Men should be constituted as it is at present, so as to make _Uniformity amidst Variety_ the Occasion of Pleasure.\" For were it not so, but on the contrary, if _irregular Objects_, _particular Truths_ and _Operations_ pleased us, beside the endless Toil this would involve us in, there must arise a perpetual Dissatisfaction in all rational Agents with themselves; since _Reason_ and _Interest_ would lead us to simple _general Causes_, while a _contrary Sense_ of _Beauty_ would make us disapprove them: _Universal Theorems_ would appear to our Understanding the best Means of increasing our Knowledge of what might be useful; while a _contrary Sense_ would set us on the search after _particular Truths_: _Thought_ and _Reflection_ would recommend Objects with _Uniformity_ amidst _Variety_, and yet this _perverse Instinct_ would involve us in Labyrinths of _Confusion_ and _Dissimilitude_. And hence we see \"how suitable it is to the _sagacious Bounty_ which we suppose in the ^Deity^, to constitute our _internal Senses_ in the manner in which they are; by which Pleasure is join'd to the Contemplation of _those Objects_ which a finite _Mind_ can best imprint and retain the Ideas of with the least Distraction; to _those Actions_ which are most efficacious, and fruitful in useful Effects; and to _those Theorems_ which most enlarge our _Minds_.\"","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Reason of general Laws.# ^As^ to the other Question, \"What Reason might influence the ^Deity^, whom no Diversity of Operation could distract or weary, to choose to operate by _simplest Means_, and _general Laws_, and to diffuse _Uniformity_, _Proportion_, and _Similitude_ thro' all the Parts of _Nature_ which we can observe?\" Perhaps there may be some real Excellence in this Manner of Operation, and in these Forms, which we know not: but this we may probably say, that since the _divine Goodness_, for the Reasons above-mention'd, has constituted our _Sense_ of _Beauty_ as it is at present, the same _Goodness_ might determine the _Great_ ^Architect^ to adorn this stupendous _Theatre_ in a manner agreeable to the Spectators, and that Part which is expos'd to the Observation of Men, so as to be pleasant to them; especially if we suppose, that he design'd to discover himself to them as _Wise_ and _Good_, as well as _Powerful_: for thus he has given them greater Evidences, thro' the whole _Earth_, of his _Art_, _Wisdom_, _Design_, and _Bounty_, than they can possibly have for the _Reason_, _Counsel_, and _Good-will_ of their fellow-Creatures, with whom they converse, with full Persuasion of these Qualities in them, about their common Affairs.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^As^ to the Operations of the ^Deity^ by _general Laws_, there is still a further Reason from a _Sense_ superior to these already consider'd, even that of ^Virtue^, or the _Beauty_ of _Action_, which is the Foundation of our greatest Happiness.

If then, according to the _Frame_ of our _Nature_, our greatest happiness must depend upon our Actions, as it may perhaps be made appear it does, \"the _Universe_ must be govern'd, not by _particular Wills_, but by _general Laws_, upon which we can found our Expectations, and project our Schemes of Action.\" Nay farther, tho' _general Laws_ did ordinarily obtain, yet if the ^Deity^ usually stopp'd their Effects whenever it was necessary to prevent any particular Evils; this would effectually, and justly supersede all human _Prudence_ and _Care_ about Actions; since a superior _Mind_ did thus relieve Men from their Charge.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.8.15"},{"type":"note","content":"[Hor.
