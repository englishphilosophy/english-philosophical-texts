But our _Inquiry_ is confin'd to Men; and before we examine the _Universality_ of this _Sense of Beauty_, or their agreement in approving _Uniformity_, it may be proper to consider, \"whether, as the other _Senses_ which give us Pleasure, do also give us Pain, so this _Sense of Beauty_ does make some Objects disagreeable to us, and the occasion of Pain.\"","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^That^ many Objects give no pleasure to our _Sense_ is obvious; many are certainly void of _Beauty_: But then there is no Form which seems necessarily disagreeable of itself, when we dread no other Evil from it, and compare it with nothing better of the Kind. Many Objects are naturally displeasing, and distasteful to our _external Senses_, as well as others pleasing and agreeable; as _Smells_, _Tastes_, and some separate _Sound_: but as to our _Sense of Beauty_, no Composition of Objects which give not unpleasant simple Ideas, seems positively unpleasant or painful of itself, had we never observ'd any thing better of the Kind. _Deformity_ is only _the absence of Beauty_, or _Deficiency in the Beauty expected in any Species_: Thus _bad Musick_ pleases _Rusticks_ who never heard any better, and the _finest Ear_ is not offended with _tuning_ of Instruments, if it be not too tedious, where no _Harmony_ is expected; and yet much smaller _Dissonancy_ shall offend amidst the Performance, where _Harmony_ is expected. A _rude Heap_ of Stones is no way offensive to one who shall be displeas'd with _Irregularity_ in _Architecture_, where _Beauty_ was expected. And had there been a Species of that Form which we call now _ugly_ or _deform'd_, and had we never seen or expected greater _Beauty_, we should have receiv'd no Disgust from it, altho' the Pleasure would not have been so great in this Form as in those we now admire. Our _Sense of Beauty_ seems design'd to give us positive Pleasure, but not positive Pain or Disgust, any further than what arises from Disappointment.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Approbation and Dislike from Association of Ideas.# ^There^ are indeed many Faces which at first View are apt to raise Dislike; but this is generally not from any positive Deformity which of itself is positively displeasing, but either from want of _expected Beauty_, or much more from their carrying some natural Indications of _morally bad Dispositions_, which we all acquire a Faculty of discerning in _Countenances_, _Airs_, and _Gestures_. That this is not occasion'd by any Form positively disgusting, will appear from this, That if upon long acquaintance we are sure of finding _Sweetness of Temper_, _Humanity and Cheerfulness_, altho' the bodily Form continues, it shall give us no Disgust or Displeasure; whereas, if any thing were naturally disagreeable, or the occasion of Pain, or positive Distaste, it would always continue so, even altho' the Aversion we might have toward it were counterbalanc'd by other Considerations. There are Horrors rais'd by some Objects, which are only the Effect of _Fear_ for ourselves, or _Compassion_ towards others, when either _Reason_, or some foolish _Association of Ideas_, makes us apprehend Danger, and not the Effect of any thing in the Form itself: for we find that most of those Objects which excite Horror at first, when Experience or Reason has remov'd the Fear, may become the occasions of Pleasure; as _ravenous Beasts_, a _tempestuous Sea_, a _craggy Precipice_, a _dark shady Valley_.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.6.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Associations.# ^We^ shall see[n2] hereafter, \"That _Associations of Ideas_ make Objects pleasant and delightful, which are not naturally apt to give any such Pleasures; and the same way, the _casual Conjunctions of Ideas_ may give a Disgust, where there is nothing disagreeable in the Form it self.\" And this is the Occasion of many fantastick Aversions to Figures of some Animals, and to some other Forms: Thus _Swine_, _Serpents_ of all Kinds, and some _Insects_ really beautiful enough, are beheld with Aversion by many People, who have got _some accidental Ideas associated_ to them.

Few Trials have been made in the simplest Instances of _Harmony_, because as soon as we find an _Ear_ incapable of relishing complex Compositions, such as our _Tunes_ are, no farther Pains are employ'd about such. But in _Figures_, did ever any Man make choice of a _Trapezium_, or any irregular _Curve_, for the _Ichnography_ or Plan of his House, without Necessity, or some great Motive of Convenience? or to make the opposite Walls _not parallel_, or _unequal_ in Height? Were ever _Trapeziums_, irregular _Polygons_ or _Curves_ chosen for the Forms of _Doors_ or _Windows_, tho' these Figures might have answer'd the Uses as well, and would have often sav'd a great part of the Time, Labour and Expence to Workmen, which is now employ'd in suiting the Stones and Timber to the _regular_ Forms? Among all the fantastick Modes of _Dress_, none was ever quite void of _Uniformity_, if it were only in _the Resemblance_ of the two Sides of the same _Robe_, and in some _general Aptitude_ to the human Form. The _Pictish Painting_ had always _relative Beauty_, by Resemblance to other Objects, and often those Objects were _originally beautiful_: however justly we might apply =^Horace^='s Censure of impertinent Descriptions in _Poetry_, \"\"$Sed non erat his locus$ ———[n3].\"\" But never were any so extravagant as to affect such Figures as are made by _the casual spilling_ of liquid Colours. Who was ever pleas'd with an _Inequality_ of Heights in _Windows_ of the same Range, or _dissimilar Shapes_ of them? with _unequal Legs_ or _Arms_, _Eyes_ or _Cheeks_ in a _Mistress_?

For the _Gothick Pillars_ are _uniform_ to each other, not only in their _Sections_, which are _Lozenge-form'd_; but also in their _Heights_ and _Ornaments_: Their _Arches_ are not one _uniform Curve_, but yet they are _Segments_ of _similar Curves_, and generally equal in the same Ranges. The very _Indian Buildings_ have some kind of _Uniformity_, and many of the ^Eastern Nations^, tho' they differ much from us, yet have great ^Regularity^ in their Manner, as well as the ^Romans^ in theirs.

Every one knows how dull a Study it is to read over a Collection of _Gazettes_, which shall perhaps relate all the same Events with the _Historian_: The superior Pleasure then of _History_ must arise, like that of _Poetry_, from the _Manners_; as when we see a _Character_ well drawn, wherein we find the secret Causes of a great Diversity of seemingly inconsistent Actions; or an _Interest of State_ laid open, or an _artful View_ nicely unfolded, the Execution of which influences very different and opposite Actions, as the Circumstances may alter.

Now it is certain, \"That there is at least as great a variety of Fancys about their Objects, as the Objects of _Beauty_:\" Nay, it is much more difficult, and perhaps impossible, to bring the Fancys or Relishes of the _external Senses_ to any general Foundation at all, or to find any Rule for the _Agreeable_ or _Disagreeable_: and yet we all allow \"that these are _natural_ Powers of _Perception_.\"","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.6.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#The Reason of it.# ^The^ Reason of this different Judgment can be no other than this, That we have got distinct Names for the _external Senses_, and none, or very few, for the _Internal_; and by this are led, as in many other Cases, to look upon the former as some way more _fix'd_, and _real_, and _natural_, than the latter. The _Sense_ of _Harmony_ has got its Name, _viz._ a _good Ear_; and we are generally brought to acknowledge this a _natural_ Power of _Perception_, or _a Sense_ some way distinct from _Hearing_: now it is certain, \"That there is as necessary a Perception of _Beauty_ upon the presence of _regular Objects_, as of _Harmony_ upon hearing certain _Sounds_.\"","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.6.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#An internal Sense does not presuppose innate Ideas.# ^But^ let it be observ'd here once for all, \"That an _internal Sense_ no more presupposes an _innate Idea_, or Principle of Knowledge, than the _external_.\" Both are _natural_ Powers of _Perception_, or _Determinations_ of _the Mind_ to receive necessarily certain Ideas from the presence of Objects. The _Internal Sense_ is, a _passive Power of receiving Ideas of Beauty from all Objects in which there is Uniformity amidst Variety_. Nor does there seem any thing more difficult in this matter, than that the Mind should be always determin'd to receive the Idea of _Sweet_, when Particles of such a Form enter the Pores of the Tongue; or to have the Idea of _Sound_ upon any quick Undulation of the Air.

The Beauty of _Trees_, their _cool Shades_, and their _Aptness_ to conceal from Observation, have made _Groves_ and _Woods_ the usual Retreat to those who love _Solitude_, especially to the _Religious_, the _Pensive_, the _Melancholy_, and the _Amorous_. And do not we find that we have so join'd the Ideas of these Dispositions of Mind with those external Objects, that they always recur to us along with them? The Cunning of the _Heathen Priests_ might make such obscure Places the Scene of the fictitious Appearances of their _Deitys_; and hence we join Ideas of something _Divine_ to them.
