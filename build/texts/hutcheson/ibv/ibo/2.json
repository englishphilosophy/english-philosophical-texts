And let it be here observ'd, that our Inquiry is only about the _Qualitys_ which are beautiful to _Men_; or about the Foundation of their Sense of Beauty: for, as was above hinted, Beauty has always relation to the _Sense_ of some Mind; and when we afterwards shew how generally the Objects which occur to us are _beautiful_, we mean, that such Objects are agreeable to the Sense of _Men_: for there are many Objects which seem no way beautiful to Men, and yet other _Animals_ seem delighted with them; they may have _Senses_ otherwise constituted than those of Men, and may have the Ideas of Beauty excited by Objects of a quite different Form. We see Animals fitted for every Place; and what to Men appears rude and shapeless, or loathsom, may be to them a _Paradise_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^That^ we may more distinctly discover the general _Foundation_ or Occasion of the Ideas of Beauty among Men, it will be necessary to consider it first in its _simpler_ Kinds, such as occurs to us in regular Figures; and we may perhaps find that the same Foundation extends to all the more complex Species of it.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Uniformity with Variety.# ^The^ Figures which excite in us the Ideas of Beauty, seem to be those in which there is _Uniformity amidst Variety_. There are many Conceptions of Objects which are agreeable upon other accounts, such as _Grandeur_, _Novelty_, _Sanctity_, and some others, which shall be mention'd hereafter[n1]. But what we call Beautiful in Objects, to speak in the Mathematical Style, seems to be in a compound _Ratio_ of _Uniformity_ and _Variety_: so that where the _Uniformity_ of Bodys is equal, the Beauty is as the _Variety_; and where the Variety is equal, the Beauty is as the _Uniformity_. This may seem probable, and holds pretty generally.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Variety.# ^First^, the _Variety_ increases the Beauty in equal Uniformity. The Beauty of an _equilateral Triangle_ is less than that of the _Square_; which is less than that of a _Pentagon_; and this again is surpass'd by the _Hexagon_. When indeed the Number of Sides is much increas'd, the Proportion of them to the _Radius_, or _Diameter_ of the Figure, or of the _Circle_, to which regular _Polygons_ have an obvious Relation, is so much lost to our Observation, that the Beauty does not always increase with the Number of Sides; and the want of Parallelism in the Sides of _Heptagons_, and other Figures of odd Numbers, may also diminish their Beauty. So in _Solids_, the _Eicosiedron_ surpasses the _Dodecaedron_, and this the _Octaedron_, which is still more beautiful than the _Cube_; and this again surpasses the regular _Pyramid_: The obvious Ground of this, is greater _Variety_ with equal _Uniformity_.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Uniformity.# ^The^ greater _Uniformity_ increases the _Beauty_ amidst equal _Variety_, in these Instances: An Equilateral _Triangle_, or even an _Isosceles_, surpasses the _Scalenum_: A _Square_ surpasses the _Rhombus_ or _Lozenge_, and this again the _Rhomboides_, which is still more beautiful than the _Trapezium_, or any Figure with irregular curve Sides. So the _regular_ Solids surpass all other Solids of equal number of plain Surfaces: And the same is observable not only in the Five perfectly _regular_ Solids, but in all those which have any considerable _Uniformity_, as _Cylinders_, _Prisms_, _Pyramids_, _Obelisks_; which please every Eye more than any rude Figures, where there is no _Unity_ or Resemblance among the Parts.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Compound Ratio.#^Instances^ of the compound _Ratio_ we have in comparing _Circles_ or _Spheres_, with _Ellipses_ or _Spheroids_ not very eccentric; and in comparing the _compound_ Solids, the _Exoctaedron_, and _Eicosidodecaedron_, with the perfectly _regular_ ones of which they are compounded: and we shall find, that the Want of that most perfect _Uniformity_ observable in the latter, is compensated by the greater _Variety_ in the former, so that the _Beauty_ is nearly equal.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^These^ Observations would probably hold true for the most part, and might be confirm'd by the Judgment of Children in the _simpler_ Figures, where the _Variety_ is not too great for their Comprehension. And however uncertain some of the particular aforesaid Instances may seem, yet this is perpetually to be observ'd, that Children are fond of all _regular_ Figures in their little Diversions, altho' they be no more convenient, or useful for them, than the Figures of our common Pebbles: We see how early they discover a _Taste_ or Sense of _Beauty_, in desiring to see Buildings, regular Gardens, or even Representations of them in Pictures of any kind.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Beauty of Nature.# ^The^ same Foundation we have for our Sense of _Beauty_, in the Works of ^Nature^. In every Part of the World which we call _Beautiful_, there is a surprizing _Uniformity_ amidst an almost infinite _Variety_. Many Parts of the Universe seem not at all design'd for the use of Man; nay, it is but a very small Spot with which we have any Acquaintance. The _Figures_ and _Motions_ of the great Bodys are not obvious to our Senses, but found out by Reasoning and Reflection, upon many long Observations: and yet as far as we can by Sense discover, or by _Reasoning_ enlarge our Knowledge, and extend our Imagination, we generally find their Structure, Order, and Motion, agreeable to our Sense of _Beauty_. Every particular Object in _Nature_ does not indeed appear _beautiful_ to us; but there is a vast Profusion of _Beauty_ over most of the Objects which occur either to our Senses, or Reasonings upon Observation: For not to mention the apparent Situation of the heavenly Bodys in the Circumference of a great Sphere, which is wholly occasion'd by the Imperfection of our Sight in discerning distances; the Forms of all the great Bodys in the Universe are nearly _Spherical_; the Orbits of their Revolutions generally _Elliptick_, and without great Eccentricity, in those which continually occur to our Observation: now these are Figures of great _Uniformity_, and therefore pleasing to us.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Further^, to pass by the less obvious _Uniformity_ in the Proportion of their _Quantitys_ of Matter, _Distances_, _Times_ of revolving, to each other; what can exhibit a greater Instance of _Uniformity amidst Variety_, than the constant Tenour of Revolutions in nearly equal Times, in each _Planet_, around its Axis, and the central Fire or ^Sun^, thro' all the Ages of which we have any Records, and in nearly the same Orbit? Thus after certain Periods, all the same Appearances are again renew'd; the alternate Successions of _Light_ and _Shade_, or _Day_ and _Night_, constantly pursuing each other around each _Planet_, with an agreeable and regular Diversity in the Times they possess the several Hemispheres, in the _Summer_, _Harvest_, _Winter_, and _Spring_; and the various _Phases_, _Aspects_, and _Situations_, of the _Planets_ to each other, their _Conjunctions_ and _Oppositions_, in which they suddenly darken each other with their Conick Shades in Eclipses, are repeated to us at their fixed Periods with invariable Constancy: These are the _Beautys_ which charm the _Astronomer_, and make his tedious Calculations pleasant. \"\"$Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem.[n2]$\"\"","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Earth.# ^Again^, as to the dry Part of the Surface of our Globe, a great Part of which is cover'd with a very pleasant inoffensive Colour, how _beautifully_ is it diversify'd with various Degrees of _Light_ and _Shade_, according to the different Situations of the Parts of its Surface, in _Mountains_, _Valleys_, _Hills_, and open _Plains_, which are variously inclin'd toward the great ^Luminary^!","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Plants.# ^If^ we descend to the minuter Works of ^Nature^, what great _Uniformity_ among all the Species of _Plants_ and _Vegetables_ in the manner of their Growth and Propagation! how near the Resemblance among all the Plants of the same Species, whose Numbers surpass our Imagination! And this _Uniformity_ is not only observable in the Form in gross; (nay, in this it is not so very exact in all Instances) but in the Structure of their minuter Parts, even of those which no Eye unassisted with Glasses can discern. In the almost infinite Multitude of _Leaves_, _Fruit_, _Seed_, _Flowers_ of any one Species, we often see a very great _Uniformity_ in the Structure and Situation of the smallest Fibres. This is the _Beauty_ which charms an ingenious _Botanist_. Nay, what great _Uniformity_ and Regularity of Figure is found in each particular _Plant_, _Leaf_, or _Flower_! In all Trees and most of the smaller Plants, the Stalks or Trunks are either _Cylinders_ nearly, or regular _Prisms_; the Branches similar to their several Trunks, arising at nearly regular Distances, when no Accidents retard their natural Growth: In one _Species_ the Branches arise in Pairs on the opposite Sides; the perpendicular Plain of Direction of the immediately superior Pair, intersecting the Plain of Direction of the inferior, nearly at right Angles: In another _Species_, the Branches spring singly, and alternately, all around in nearly equal Distances: And the Branches in other _Species_ sprout all in Knots around the Trunk, one for each Year. And in each _Species_, all the Branches in the first Shoots preserve the same Angles with their Trunk; and they again sprout out into smaller Branches exactly after the Manner of their Trunks. Nor ought we to pass over that great _Unity_ of Colours which we often see in all the Flowers of the same Plant or Tree, and often of a whole Species; and their exact Agreement in many shaded Transitions into opposite Colours, in which all the Flowers of the same Plant generally agree, nay, often all the Flowers of a Species.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Animals.# ^Again^, as to the _Beauty_ of _Animals_, either in their inward Structure, which we come to the Knowledge of by Experiment and long Observation, or their outward Form, we shall find surprizing _Uniformity_ among all the Species which are known to us, in the Structure of those Parts, upon which Life depends more immediately. And how amazing is the _Unity_ of Mechanism, when we shall find an almost infinite Diversity of Motions, all their Actions in _walking_, _running_, _flying_, _swimming_; all their serious Efforts for _Self-preservation_, all their freakish _Contortions_ when they are gay and sportful, in all their various Limbs, perform'd by one simple Contrivance of a contracting _Muscle_, apply'd with inconceivable Diversitys to answer all these Ends! Various Engines might have obtain'd the same Ends; but then there had been less _Uniformity_, and the _Beauty_ of our Animal Systems, and of particular Animals, had been much less, when this surprizing _Unity_ of Mechanism had been remov'd from them.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Among^ Animals of the same Species, the _Unity_ is very obvious, and this Resemblance is the very Ground of our ranking them in such _Classes_ or _Species_, notwithstanding the great Diversitys in Bulk, Colour, Shape, which are observ'd even in those call'd of the same Species. And then in each Individual, how universal is that _Beauty_ which arises from the exact Resemblance of all the external double Members to each other, which seems the universal Intention of ^Nature^, when no Accident prevents it! We see the Want of this Resemblance never fails to pass for an Imperfection, and Want of _Beauty_, tho' no other Inconvenience ensues; as when the Eyes are not exactly like, or one Arm or Leg is a little shorter or smaller than its fellow.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^As^ to that most powerful Beauty in _Countenances_, _Airs_, _Gestures_, _Motion_, we shall shew in the second Treatise[n3], that it arises from some imagin'd _Indication_ of morally good Dispositions of Mind.

And hence it is, that either the one or the other may be represented to us even in _Miniature_, without Relation to any external Object, by observing how the Body surpasses the Proportion it should have to the Head in _Giants_, and falls below it in _Dwarfs_. There is a further _Beauty_ arising from that Figure, which is a natural Indication of _Strength_; but this may be pass'd over, because probably it may be alledg'd, that our Approbation of this Shape flows from an opinion of _Advantage_, and not from the Form it self.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^The^ _Beauty_ arising from Mechanism, apparently adapted to the Necessities and Advantages of any Animal; which pleases us, even tho' there be no Advantage to our selves ensuing from it; will be consider'd under the Head of _Relative Beauty_, or _Design_[n4].","subId":"16","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Fowls.# ^The^ peculiar _Beauty_ of _Fowls_ can scarce be omitted, which arises from the great _Variety_ of Feathers, a curious Sort of Machines adapted to many admirable Uses, which retain a considerable Resemblance in their Structure among all the Species; and frequently a perfect _Uniformity_ in those of the same Species in the corresponding Parts, and in the two Sides of each Individual; besides all the _Beauty_ of lively Colours and gradual Shades, not only in the external Appearance of the Fowl, resulting from an artful Combination of shaded Feathers, but often visible even in one Feather separately.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Fluids.# ^If^ our Reasonings about the _Nature_ of _Fluids_ be just, the vast Stores of _Water_ will give us an Instance of _Uniformity_ in _Nature_ above Imagination, when we reflect upon the almost infinite Multitude of small, polish'd, smooth Spheres, which must be suppos'd form'd in all the parts of this Globe. The same _Uniformity_ there is probably among the Parts of other _Fluids_ as well as Water: and the like must be observ'd in several other natural Bodys, as _Salts_, _Sulphurs_, and such like; whose uniform Propertys do probably depend upon an _Uniformity_ in the Figures of their Parts.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.2.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Harmony.# ^Under^ _Original Beauty_ we may include _Harmony_, or _Beauty of Sound_, if that Expression can be allow'd, because _Harmony_ is not usually conceiv'd as an Imitation of any thing else. _Harmony_ often raises Pleasure in those who know not what is the Occasion of it: And yet the Foundation of this Pleasure is known to be a sort of _Uniformity_. When the several Vibrations of one Note regularly coincide with the Vibrations of another, they make an agreeable Composition; and such Notes are call'd _Concords_. Thus the Vibrations of any one Note coincide in _Time_ with two Vibrations of its _Octave_; and two Vibrations of any Note coincide with three of its _Fifth_; and so on in the rest of the _Concords_. Now no _Composition_ can be harmonious, in which the Notes are not, for the most part, dispos'd according to these natural Proportions. Besides which, a due Regard must be had to the _Key_, which governs the whole, and to the _Time_ and _Humour_, in which the Composition is begun: a frequent and inartificial _Change_ of any of which will produce the greatest, and most unnatural _Discord_. This will appear, by observing the _Dissonance_ which would arise from tacking Parts of different Tunes together as one, altho' both were separately agreeable.
