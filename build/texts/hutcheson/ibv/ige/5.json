There are nearer and stronger Kinds of _Benevolence_, when the Objects stand in some nearer Relations to ourselves, which have obtain'd distinct Names; such as _natural Affection_, _Gratitude_, _Esteem_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Natural Affection.# ^One^ Species of _natural Affection_, viz. That in _Parents_ towards their _Children_, has been consider'd already[n1]; we shall only observe farther, That there is the same kind of _Affection_ among _collateral Relations_, tho' in a weaker Degree; which is universally observable, where no Opposition of _Interest_ produces contrary Actions, or counterbalances the Power of this _natural Affection_.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Not founded on Merit, or Acquaintance.# ^We^ may also observe, that as to the _Affection_ of _Parents_, it cannot be entirely founded on _Merit_ or _Acquaintance_; not only because it is antecedent to all Acquaintance, which might occasion _Esteem_; but because it operates where Acquaintance would produce _Hatred_, even toward _Children_ apprehended to be _vitious_. And this _Affection_ is farther confirm'd to be from ^Nature^, because it is always observ'd to _descend_, and not _ascend_ from _Children_ to _Parents_ mutually. ^Nature^, who seems sometimes frugal in her Operations, has strongly determin'd _Parents_ to the Care of their _Children_, because they universally stand in absolute need of Support from them; but has left it to _Reflection_, and a _Sense_ of _Gratitude_, to produce Returns of _Love in Children_, toward such _tender kind Benefactors_, who very seldom stand in such absolute need of Support from their Posterity, as their Children did from them. Now did _Acquaintance_ or _Merit_ produce _natural Affection_, we surely should find it strongest in _Children_, on whom all the Obligations are laid by a thousand good Offices; which yet is quite contrary to Observation. Nay, this Principle seems not confin'd to _Mankind_, but extends to other _Animals_, where yet we scarcely ever suppose any Ideas of Merit; and is observ'd to continue in them no longer than the Necessitys of their Young require. Nor could it be of any Service to the Young that it should, since when they are grown up, they can receive little Benefit from the Love of their _Dams_.

Every one knows that _Beneficence_ toward ourselves makes a much deeper Impression upon us, and raises _Gratitude_, or a _stronger Love_ toward the _Benefactor_, than _equal Beneficence_ toward a _third Person_[n2]. Now because of the vast Numbers of Mankind, their distant Habitations, and the Incapacity of any one to be remarkably useful to great Multitudes; that our _Benevolence_ might not be quite distracted with a Multiplicity of Objects, whose equal Virtues would equally recommend them to our Regard; or become useless, by being equally extended to Multitudes, whose Interests we could not understand, nor be capable of promoting, having no Intercourse of Offices with them; ^Nature^ has so well ordered it, that as our Attention is more raised by those good Offices which are done to ourselves or our Friends, so they cause a stronger Sense of Approbation in us, and produce a stronger Benevolence toward the Authors of them.

It is not the being universally known, no matter how. A _covetous Man_ is not _honour'd_ by being universally known as _covetous_; nor a _weak_, _selfish_, or _luxurious Man_, when he is known to be so: Much less can a _treacherous_, _cruel_, or _ungrateful Man_, be said to be _honour'd_ for his being known as such. A _Posture-master_, a _Fire-eater_, or _Practiser_ of _Leger-de-main_, is not _honour'd_ for these publick Shews, unless we consider him as a Person capable of giving the Pleasures of _Admiration_ and _Surprize_ to Multitudes. _Honour_ then is _the Opinion of others concerning our morally good Actions, or Abilitys presum'd to be apply'd that way_; for _Abilitys_ constantly apply'd to other Purposes, procure the greatest Infamy.

When _Honour_ is thus constituted by ^Nature^ _pleasant_ to us, it may be an _additional Motive_ to _Virtue_, as, we said above[n5], the Pleasure arising from _Reflection on our Benevolence_ was: but the Person whom we imagine _perfectly virtuous_, acts immediately from the _Love_ of others; however these refin'd Interests may be _joint Motives_ to him to set about such a Course of Actions, or to cultivate every _kind Inclination_, and to despise every _contrary Interest_, as giving a smaller Happiness than _Reflection_ on his own Virtue, and _Consciousness_ of the Esteem of others.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Shame^ is in the same manner constituted an _immediate Evil_, and influences us the same way to abstain from _moral Evil_: not that any Action or Omission would appear _virtuous_, where the _sole Motive_ was Fear of _Shame_.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Opinions flow from the Moral Sense.# ^But^ to enquire farther, how far the Opinions of our Company can raise a Sense of _moral Good or Evil_: If any Opinion be universal in any Country, Men of little Reflection will probably embrace it. If an Action be believ'd to be _advantageous_ to the _Agent_, we may be led to believe so too, and then _Self-Love_ may make us undertake it; or may, the same way, make us shun an Action reputed _pernicious_ to the _Agent_. If an Action pass for _advantageous_ to the _Publick_, we may believe so too; and what next? If we have no _disinterested Benevolence_, what shall move us to undertake it? \"Why, we love _Honour_; and to obtain this Pleasure, we will undertake the Action from _Self-Interest_.\" Now, is _Honour_ only the Opinion of our Country, that an Action is _advantageous_ to the _Publick_? No: we see no Honour paid to the _useful Treachery_ of an Enemy, whom we have brib'd to our Side, to _casual undesign'd Services_, or to the most useful Effects of _Compulsion_ on _Cowards_; and yet we see Honour paid to _unsuccessful Attempts_ to serve the Publick from sincere Love to it. _Honour_ then presupposes a _Sense_ of something _amiable_ besides _Advantage_, _viz._ a _Sense_ of _Excellence_ in a _publick Spirit_; and therefore the _first Sense_ of _moral Good_ must be antecedent to _Honour_, for _Honour_ is founded upon it[n6]. The Company we keep may lead us, without examining, to believe that certain Actions tend to the _publick Good_; but that our Company _honours_ such Actions, and loves the _Agent_, must flow from a _Sense_ of some _Excellence_ in this Love of the _Publick_, and serving its Interests.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"^We^ therefore, say they again, pretend to _love_ the _Publick_, altho' we only desire the Pleasure of _Honour_; and we will applaud all who seem to act in that manner, either that we may reap _Advantage_ from their Actions, or that others may believe we _really love_ the _Publick_.\" But shall any Man ever be heartily _approved_ and _admired_, when we know that _Self-Love_ is the only spring of his Actions? No: that is impossible. Or, shall we ever really love Men who appear to _love_ the _Publick_, without a _moral Sense_? No: we could form no Idea of such a Temper; and as for these Pretenders to _publick Love_, we should hate them as Hypocrites, and our Rivals in Fame. Now this is all which could be effected by the Opinions of our Country, even supposing they had a _moral Sense_, provided we had none ourselves: They never could make us admire _Virtue_, or _virtuous Characters_ in others; but could only give us Opinions of _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_ in Actions, according as they tended procure to us the Pleasures of _Honour_, or the Pain of _Shame_.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^But^ if we suppose that Men have, by ^Nature^, a _moral Sense_ of _Goodness_ in Actions, and that they are capable of _disinterested Love_; all is easy.

This needs little Illustration. Every Mortal is made uneasy by any grievous Misery he sees another involv'd in, unless the Person be imagin'd _evil_ in a _moral Sense_: Nay, it is almost impossible for us to be unmov'd, even in that Case. _Advantage_ may make us do a cruel Action, or may overcome _Pity_; but it scarce ever extinguishes it. A sudden Passion of _Hatred_ or _Anger_ may represent a Person as _absolutely evil_, and so extinguish _Pity_; but when the Passion is over, it often returns. Another _disinterested_ View may even in cold Blood overcome _Pity_; such as _Love_ to _our Country_, or _Zeal_ for _Religion_. _Persecution_ is generally occasion'd by _Love_ of _Virtue_, and a _Desire_ of the _eternal Happiness_ of _Mankind_, altho' our _Folly_ makes us choose absurd Means to promote it; and is often accompany'd with _Pity_ enough to make the _Persecutor_ uneasy, in what, for prepollent Reasons, he chooses; unless his Opinion leads him to look upon the _Heretick_ as _absolutely_ and _intirely evil_.","subId":"30","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.5.30"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^We^ may here observe, how wonderfully the Constitution of _human Nature_ is adapted to move _Compassion_.

We _mechanically_ send forth _Shrieks_ and _Groans_ upon any surprizing Apprehension of _Evil_; so that no Regard to Decency can sometimes restrain them.
