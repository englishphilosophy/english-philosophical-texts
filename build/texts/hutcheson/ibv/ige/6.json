But let us examine the Sentiments which Men universally form of the State of others, when they are no way immediately concern'd; for in these Sentiments _human Nature_ is _calm_ and _undisturb'd_, and shews its _true Face_.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Now^ should we imagine a _rational Creature_ in a sufficiently happy State, whose Mind was, without _Interruption_, wholly occupy'd with pleasant Sensations of _Smell_, _Taste_, _Touch_, _&c._ if at the same time all other Ideas were excluded? Should we not think the State _low_, _mean_, and _sordid_, if there were no _Society_, no _Love_ or _Friendship_, no _good Offices_? What then must that State be, wherein there are no Pleasures but those of the _external Senses_, with such long Intervals as _human Nature_ at present must have? Do these short Fits of Pleasure make the _Luxurious_ happy? How _insipid_ and _joyless_ are the Reflections on past Pleasure? And how poor a Recompence is the Return of the transient Sensation, for the _nauseous Satietys_, and _Languors_ in the Intervals?

Now, if the bare Absence of _moral Good_ makes, in our Judgment, the State of a rational Agent contemptible; the Presence of _contrary_ Dispositions is always imagin'd by us to sink him into a degree of Misery, from which no other Pleasures can relieve him. Would we ever wish to be in the same Condition with a _wrathful_, _malicious_, _revengeful_, or _envious Being_, tho' we were at the same time to enjoy all the Pleasures of the _external_ and _internal Senses_? The internal Pleasures of _Beauty_ and _Harmony_ contribute greatly indeed toward soothing the Mind into a forgetfulness of _Wrath_, _Malice_ or _Revenge_; and they must do so, before we can have any tolerable Delight or Enjoyment: for while _these Affections_ possess the Mind, there is nothing but _Torment_ and _Misery_.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Castle-builders prove it.# ^What^ _Castle-builder_, who forms to himself imaginary Scenes of Life, in which he thinks he should be happy, ever made _acknowledg'd Treachery_, _Cruelty_, or _Ingratitude_, the Steps by which he mounted to his wish'd-for Elevation, or Parts of his Character, when he had attain'd it?

Where there is no _Virtue_, there is nothing worth Desire or Contemplation; the _Romance_ or _Epos_ must end. Nay, the _Difficulty_[n2], or _natural Evil_, does so much increase the _Virtue_ of the _good_ Action which it accompanys, that we cannot easily sustain these Works after the Distress is over; and if we continue the Work, it must be by presenting a new Scene of _Benevolence_, in a prosperous Fortune. A Scene of _external Prosperity_ or _natural Good_, without any thing _moral_ or _virtuous_, cannot entertain a Person of the dullest Imagination, had he ever so much interested himself in the Fortunes of his Hero; for where _Virtue_ ceases, there remains nothing worth wishing to our Favourite, or which we can be delighted to view his Possession of, when we are most studious of his Happiness.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Virtue own'd superior to all Pleasure.# ^Let^ us take a particular Instance, to try how much we prefer the Possession of _Virtue_ to all other Enjoyments, and how we look upon _Vice_ as worse than any other Misery.

We should never have imagin'd him happier, had he acted otherwise; or thought him in a more eligible State, with Liberty and Safety, at the Expence of his _Virtue_.

Let us consider the Characters of _Beauty_, which are commonly admir'd in Countenances, and we shall find them to be _Sweetness_, _Mildness_, _Majesty_, _Dignity_, _Vivacity_, _Humility_, _Tenderness_, _Good-nature_; that is, that certain _Airs_, _Proportions_, $je ne scai quoy's$, are natural Indications of such Virtues, or of Abilitys or Dispositions toward them. As we observ'd above[n4] of _Misery_ or _Distress_ appearing in Countenances; so it is certain, almost all _habitual Dispositions_ of _Mind_ form the Countenance in such a manner, as to give some Indications of them to the Spectator. Our _violent_ Passions are obvious at first View in the Countenance; so that sometimes no Art can conceal them: and smaller degrees of them give some less obvious Turns to the Face, which an accurate Eye will observe. Now, when the _natural Air_ of a Face approaches to that which any Passion would form it unto, we make a Conjecture from this concerning the _leading Disposition_ of the Person's _Mind_.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^As^ to those Fancys which prevail in certain Countrys toward _large Lips_, _little Noses_, _narrow Eyes_; unless we knew from themselves under what Idea such Features are admir'd, whether as _naturally beautiful_ in Form, or Proportion to the rest of the Face; or as presum'd Indications of some _moral Qualitys_; we may more probably conclude that it is the _latter_; since this is so much the Ground of Approbation or Aversion towards Faces among ourselves. And as to those Features which we count _naturally disagreeable_ as to Form, we know the Aversion on this account is so weak, that _moral Qualitys_ shall procure a Liking, even to the Face, in Persons who are sensible of the _Irregularity_, or Want of that _Regularity_ which is common in others. With us, certain Features are imagin'd to denote Dullness; as _hollow Eyes_, _large Lips_; a _Colour_ of Hair, _Wantonness_: and may we not conclude the like _Association of Ideas_, upon some probable Foundation in Nature, to be the Ground of those Approbations which appear unaccountable to us?","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^In^ the same manner, when there is nothing _grosly_ disproportion'd in any Face, what is it we dispraise?

Thus a shady Wood must have its _solemn venerable Genius_, and proper _rural Gods_; every clear Fountain, its _sacred chaste Nymph_; and River, its _bountiful God_, with his _Urn_, and perhaps a _Cornucopi{ae}_ diffusing _Plenty_ and _Fruitfulness_ along its Banks. The _Day-light_ is _holy_, _benign_, and _powerful_ to banish the pernicious Spirits of the _Night_. The Morning is a _kind officious Goddess_, _tripping_ over the dewy Mountains, and _ushering_ in Light to _Gods_ and _Men_. War is an _impetuous_, _cruel_, _undistinguishing Monster_, whom no _Virtue_, no Circumstance of _Compassion_, can move from his bloody Purposes. The Steel is _unrelenting_; the Arrow and Spear are _impatient_ to destroy, and carry _Death_ on their Points. Our modern Engines of War are also _frightful Personages_, counterfeiting with their rude Throats the Thunder of =^Jove^=. The _moral Imagery_ of _Death_ is every-where known, _viz._ his _Insensibility_ to _Pity_, his _Inflexibility_, and _universal impartial Empire_. ^Fortune^ is inimitably drawn by =^Horace^=[n10], with all her _Retinue_ and _Votaries_, and with her _rigid severe_ Minister, _Necessity_. The Qualitys of _Mind_ too become _Persons_. _Love_ becomes a =^Venus^=, or a =^Cupid^=; _Courage_, or _Conduct_, a =^Mars^=, or a =^Pallas^=, _protecting_ and _assisting_ the Hero; before them march _Terror_ and _Dread_, _Flight_ and _Pursuit_, _Shouts_ and _Amazement_. Nay, the _most sacred Poets_ are often led into this _Imagery_, and represent _Justice_ and _Judgment_ as _supporting_ the ^Almighty^'s Throne, and _Mercy_ and _Truth_ _going_ before his Face: They shew us _Peace_ as _springing_ up from the Earth, and _Mercy_ _looking_ down from Heaven.","subId":"29","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.6.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Every^ one perceives a greater Beauty in this manner of Representation, this Imagery, this Conjunction of _moral Ideas_, than in the fullest Narration, or the most lively natural Description.
