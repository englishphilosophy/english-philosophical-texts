Had we no _Sense_ of _Good_ distinct from the _Advantage_ or _Interest_ arising from the external Senses, and the Perceptions of _Beauty_ and _Harmony_; our Sensations and Affections toward a _fruitful Field_, or _commodious Habitation_, would be much the same with what we have toward a _generous Friend_, or any _noble Character_; for both are or may be _advantageous_ to us: And we should no more admire any Action, or love any Person in a distant _Country_, or _Age_, whose Influence could not extend to us, than we love the _Mountains_ of ^Peru^, while we are unconcern'd in the _Spanish Trade_. We should have the same Sentiments and Affections toward _inanimate Beings_, which we have toward _rational Agents_, which yet every one knows to be false. Upon Comparison, we say, \"Why should we approve or love _inanimate Beings_? They have no Intention of _Good_ to us, or to any other Person; their _Nature_ makes them fit for our Uses, which they neither know nor study to serve.

Do not _inanimate Objects_ promote our _Advantage_, as well as _benevolent Persons_, who do us Offices of _Kindness_ and _Friendship_? Should we not then have the same endearing Approbation of both? or only the same cold Opinion of _Advantage_ in both?\" The Reason why it is not so, must be this, \"That we have a distinct Perception of _Beauty_, or _Excellence_ in the kind Affections of _rational Agents_; whence we are determin'd to admire and love such _Characters_ and _Persons_.\"","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#In Actions done to our selves.# ^Suppose^ we reap the same _Advantage_ from two Men, one of whom serves us from an _ultimate Desire_ of our Happiness, and Good-will toward us; the other from Views of _Self-Interest_, or by _Constraint_: both are in this Case equally beneficial or _advantageous_ to us, and yet we shall have quite different Sentiments of them. We must then certainly have other Perceptions of _moral Actions_, than those of _Advantage_: And that Power of receiving these Perceptions may be call'd a ^Moral Sense^, since the Definition agrees to it, _viz._ _a Determination of the Mind, to receive any Idea from the Presence of an Object which occurs to us, independent on our Will_[n1].","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Of Evil, Moral and Natural.# ^This^ perhaps will be equally evident from our Ideas of _Evil_, done to us designedly by a _rational Agent_.

But I fansy every one is very differently affected on these Occasions, tho' there may be equal _natural Evil_ in both. Nay, Actions no way detrimental may occasion the strongest Anger and Indignation, if they evidence only impotent Hatred or Contempt. And, on the other hand, the Intervention of _moral Ideas_ may prevent our _Condemnation_ of the Agent, or bad moral Apprehension of that Action, which causes to us the greatest _natural Evil_. Thus the Opinion of _Justice_ in any Sentence, will prevent all Ideas of _moral Evil_ in the Execution, or Hatred toward the _Magistrate_, who is the immediate Cause of our greatest Sufferings.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#In Actions toward others.# ^In^ our Sentiments of Actions which affect ourselves, there is indeed a Mixture of the Ideas of _natural_ and _moral Good_, which require some Attention to separate them.

For let it be here observ'd, that those Senses by which we perceive Pleasure in natural Objects, whence they are constituted _Advantageous_, could never raise in us any Desire of _publick Good_, but only of what was good to ourselves in particular. Nor could they ever make us approve an Action merely because of its promoting the Happiness of others. And yet, as soon as any Action is represented to us as flowing from _Love_, _Humanity_, _Gratitude_, _Compassion_, a _Study_ of the good of others, and an ultimate Desire of their Happiness, altho' it were in the most distant Part of the World, or in some past Age, we feel Joy within us, admire the lovely Action, and praise its Author.

But when we are under the Influence of a virtuous Temper, and thereby engaged in virtuous Actions, we are not always conscious of any Pleasure, nor are we only pursuing private Pleasures, as will appear hereafter: 'tis only by _reflex Acts_ upon our Temper and Conduct that we enjoy the Delights of Virtue.

The Quality approved by our moral Sense is conceived to reside in the Person approved, and to be a Perfection and Dignity in him: _Approbation_ of another's Virtue is not conceived as making the Approver happy, or virtuous, or worthy, tho' 'tis attended with some samll Pleasure. Virtue is then called _amiable_ or _lovely_, from its raising _Good-will_ or _Love_ in Spectators toward the Agent; and not from the Agent's perceiving the virtuous Temper to be advantageous to him, or desiring to obtain it under that View. A virtuous Temper is called _good_ or _beatifick_, not that it is always attended with Pleasure in the Agent; much less that some small Pleasure attends the Contemplation of it in the Approver: but from this, that every Spectator is persuaded that the _reflex Acts_ of the virtuous Agent upon his own Temper will give him the highest Pleasures.
