Nor shall we find any thing amiable in any Action whatsoever, where there is no _Benevolence_ imagin'd; nor in any Disposition, or Capacity, which is not suppos'd applicable to, and design'd for, _benevolent_ Purposes. Nay, as was before observ'd[n1], the Actions which in Fact are exceedingly useful, shall appear void of _moral Beauty_, if we know they proceeded from no kind Intentions towards others; and yet an unsuccessful Attempt of Kindness, or of promoting _publick Good_, shall appear as amiable as the most successful, if it flow'd from as _strong Benevolence_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Religion.# ^Hence^ _those_ Affections which would lead us to do Good to our Benefactor, shall appear _amiable_, and the _contrary_ Affections _odious_, even when our Actions cannot possibly be of any Advantage or Hurt to him.

Never were there any Mortals so poor, so inconsiderable, whose grateful Praise would not be some way delightful; and by whom we would not rather chuse to be belov'd than hated, if their Love no way evidenc'd us to be Partners in their Vices, or concern'd in their Meanness. And thus the _most abject Person oblig'd_ is capable, and inclin'd to make no small Addition to our Happiness by his _Love_ and _Gratitude_, when he is utterly incapable of any other Return, and when we expect none from him: Thus, \"\"_——— A grateful Mind // By owing owes not, and still pays, at once // Indebted and discharg'd ——_[n2]\"\"","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^As^ to _external Performances_ of Religion, they are no doubt very various in different Nations and Ages; and _Education_ may give Men Opinions, that certain Actions are pleasing, and others displeasing to the ^Deity^: but then where-ever any external Rite of Worship is approv'd, there also it is look'd upon to proceed from _Love_ toward the ^Deity^, or some other Affection necessarily join'd with _Love_, as _Reverence_, _Repentance_, or _Sorrow_ to have offended. So that the general Principle of _Love_ is the Foundation of all the _apparent moral Excellence_, even in the most fantastick Rites of Worship which were ever approv'd. For as to Rites design'd only to appease a _furious Being_, no Mortal, I fansy, apprehends there is any _Virtue_, or _Excellence_ in them; but that they are chosen only as the dishonourable Means of avoiding a greater Evil. Now as there are various speculative Opinions about what is acceptable to the ^Deity^, it necessarily follows, \"That, accordingly, _Practices_, and _Approbation_, must be _various_; tho' all the _moral Goodness_ of Actions is still presum'd to flow from _Love_.\"","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Social Virtues.# ^Again^, that we may see how _Benevolence_ is the Foundation of all apprehended _Excellence_ in _social Virtues_, let us only observe, That amidst the Diversity of Sentiments on this Head among various Sects, this is still allow'd to be the way of deciding the Controversy about any disputed Practice, _viz._ to inquire whether this Conduct, or the contrary, will most effectually promote the _publick Good_. The _Morality_ is immediately adjusted, when the natural Tendency, or Influence of the Action upon the _universal natural Good_ of _Mankind_, is agreed upon. That which produces more _Good_ than _Evil_ in the _Whole_, is acknowledg'd _good_; and what does not, is counted _evil_.

But I fansy those, who believe the ^Deity^ to be _good_, would not rashly alledge such a Command, unless they also asserted, that the thing commanded did tend more to the _universal Good_, than the contrary, either by preventing the external Evils of _Civil War_, or by enuring Men to _Patience_, or some _other Quality_ which they apprehended necessary to their everlasting Happiness. And were it not so, _Passive Obedience_ might be recommended as an _inglorious Method_ of escaping a greater Mischief, but could never have any thing _morally amiable_ in it.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^But^ let us quit the Disputes of the _Learned_, on whom, it may be alledg'd, _Custom_ and _Education_ have a powerful Influence; and consider upon what Grounds, in common Life, Actions are _approv'd_ or _condemn'd_, _vindicated_ or _excus'd_. We are universally asham'd to say an Action is _just_, because it tends to my _Advantage_, or to the _Advantage_ of the _Actor_: And we as seldom condemn a _beneficent kind Action_, because it is not _advantageous_ to us, or to the _Actor_. _Blame_ and _Censure_ are founded on a Tendency to _publick Evil_, or a Principle of _private Malice_ in the _Agent_, or _Neglect_ at least of the _Good_ of others; on _Inhumanity_ of Temper, or at least such _strong Selfishness_ as makes the _Agent_ careless of the Sufferings of others: and thus we _blame_ and _censure_ when the Action no way affects ourselves. All the moving and persuasive Vindications of Actions, which may, from some _partial_ evil Tendency, appear _evil_, are taken from this, that they were necessary to some _greater Good_, which counterbalanc'd the _Evil_: \"_Severity_ toward a few, is _Compassion_ toward multitudes.—_Transitory Punishments_ are necessary for avoiding more _durable Evils_.—Did not _some_ suffer on such Occasions, there would be _no living_ for honest Men\",—and such like.

And let it be here observ'd, that we are so far from imagining all Men to act only from _Self-Love_, that we universally expect in others a Regard for the _Publick_; and do not look upon the Want of this, as barely the Absence of _moral Good_, or _Virtue_, but even as _positively evil_ and _hateful_.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Moral Evil not always Malice.# ^Contrarys^ may illustrate each other; let us therefore observe the _general Foundation_ of _our Sense_ of _moral Evil_ more particularly. _Disinterested Malice_, or ultimate Desire of the Misery of others, is the highest pitch of what we count _vitious_; and every Action appears _evil_, which is imagin'd to flow from any degree of _this Affection_. Perhaps a _violent Passion_ may hurry Men into it for a few Moments, and our _rash angry Sentiments_ of our Enemys, may represent them as having such _odious Dispositions_; but it is very probable, from the Reasons offer'd above[n3], that there is no such degree of Wickedness in _human Nature_, as in _cold blood_, to desire the Misery of others, when it is conceiv'd no way useful to _our Interests_.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^The^ frequent, and seemingly unprovoked Cruelties of the =^Nero^='s and =^Domitian^='s, are often alledged in Opposition to all this; but perhaps unjustly.

He imagines the surest Means of his own Safety is to appear terrible, and to deprive his Enemys of all Hopes of escaping by his Compassion. The Fame of Virtue in eminent Subjects is matter of Envy, and is a Reproach upon the Tyrant: It weakens his Power, and makes them dangerous to him. _Power_ becomes the Object of Delight to the Tyrant; and in Ostentation of it, he may break through all Regards to Justice and Humanity. Habits of Cruelty can be acquired in such a Course.

When we are under the fresh Impressions of an Injury, we find, that our Minds are wholly fill'd with Apprehensions of the Person who injur'd us, as if he were _absolutely evil_, and _delighted_ in doing Mischief: We overlook the Virtues, which, when calm, we could have observ'd in him: we forget that perhaps he acted from _Self-Love_, and not _Malice_, or, it may be, some _generous_ or _kind Intention_ toward others. These, probably, are the Opinions which a _Tyrant_ constantly forms concerning _Mankind_; and having very much weaken'd all _kind Affections_ in himself, however he may pretend to them, he judges of the Tempers of others by his own. And were Men really such as he apprehends them, his Treatment of them would not be very unreasonable. We shall generally find our Passions arising suitably to the Apprehensions we form of others: if they are rashly form'd upon some sudden slight Views, it is no wonder if we find Dispositions following upon them, very little suited to the _real State of human Nature_.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Ordinary Springs of Vice.# ^The^ ordinary Springs of _Vice_ then among Men, must be a _mistaken Self-Love_, made so violent, as to overcome _Benevolence_; or such strong _Appetites_, or Passions either selfish, or toward some narrow Systems, as overcome our Regard to Publick Good; or _Affections_ arising from _false_, and _rashly form'd Opinions_ of _Mankind_; which we run into thro' the weakness of our _Benevolence_. When Men, who had good Opinions of each other, happen to have _contrary Interests_, they are apt to have their _good Opinions_ of each other _abated_, by imagining a _design'd Opposition_ from _Malice_; without this, they can scarcely _hate_ one another. Thus two _Candidates_ for the same Office wish each other _dead_, because that is an ordinary way by which Men make room for each other; but if there remains any Reflection on each other's Virtue, as there sometimes may in benevolent Tempers, then their Opposition may be without _Hatred_; and if another better Post, where there is no Competition, were bestow'd on one of them, the other shall rejoice at it.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Self-Love indifferent.# ^Actions^ which flow solely from _Self-Love_, and yet evidence no Want of _Benevolence_, having no hurtful Effects upon others, seem of a middle Nature, neither virtuous nor vitious, and neither raise the _Love_ or _Hatred_ of the Observer. Our Reason can indeed discover certain Bounds, within which we may not only act from _Self-Love_, consistently with the _Good_ of the _Whole_, but every Mortal's acting thus within these Bounds for his own _Good_, is absolutely necessary for the _Good_ of the _Whole_; and the Want of such _Self-Love_ would be _universally pernicious_. Hence, he who pursues his own _private Good_, with an Intention also to concur with that Constitution which tends to the _Good_ of the _Whole_; and much more he who promotes his _own Good_, with a direct View of making himself more capable of serving ^God^, or doing good to _Mankind_; acts not only _innocently_, but also _honourably_, and _virtuously_: for in both these Cases, _Benevolence_ concurs with _Self-Love_ to excite him to the Action. And thus _a Neglect_ of our _own Good_ may be _morally evil_, and argue a Want of _Benevolence_ toward the _Whole_. But when _Self-Love_ breaks over the Bounds above-mention'd, and leads us into Actions detrimental to _others_, and to the _Whole_; or makes us insensible of the _generous kind Affections_; then it appears _vitious_, and is _disapprov'd_.

Nay farther, if any _Good_ was propos'd to the Pursuit of an _Agent_, and he had a _Competitor_ in every respect _only equal_ to himself; the _highest_ universal _Benevolence_ possible would not lead a wise Man to prefer another to himself, were there no Ties of Gratitude, or some other external Circumstance to move him to yield to his _Competitor_.
