The _Sound perceived_by the Hearer excites the _Idea_ to which it is connected. 3. In like manner a _Judgment_ in the Speaker's Mind is accompanyed with the _Idea of a Combination of Sounds._ 4.

Never was bare _Significancy of Falshood_made the Idea of _moral Evil._ Speaking _logical Falshood_was still looked upon as innocent in many cases.
