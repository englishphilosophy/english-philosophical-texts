And that, in like manner, what determines any Agent to _approve_ his own Action, is its _Tendency to his private Happiness_ in the whole, tho' it may bring _present Pain_ along with it: That the _Approbation_ of the Action of another, is from an Opinion of its Tendency to the Happiness of the _Approver_, either _immediately_ or more _remotely_: That each Agent may discover it to be the surest way to promote his private Happiness, to do _publickly useful Actions_, and to abstain from those which are _publickly hurtful_: That the neglecting to observe this, and doing _publickly hurtful Actions_, does mischief to the whole of Mankind, by hurting any one part; that every one has some little _damage_ by this Action: Such an _inadvertent Person_ might possibly be _pernicious_ to any one, were he in his Neighbourhood; and the very _Example_ of such Actions may extend over the whole World, and produce some pernicious Effects upon any Observer. That therefore every one may look upon such Actions as _hurtful to himself_, and in this view does disapprove them, and hates the Agent.

Men are conscious of no such Intentions or _acute Reflections_ about these Actions. Ingenious speculative Men, in their straining to support an _Hypothesis_, may contrive a thousand _subtle selfish Motives_, which a kind generous Heart never dreamed of. In like manner, this Scheme can never account for the sudden _Approbation_, and violent _Sense_ of something amiable in Actions done in distant Ages and Nations, while the Approver has perhaps never thought of these distant _Tendencies_ to his Happiness. Nor will it better account for our _want of Approbation_ toward _publickly useful Actions_ done _casually_, or only with Intention of _private Happiness_ to the Agent. And then, in these Actions reputed _generous_, if the Agent's Motive was only a view to his _own Pleasure_, how come we to approve them more than his _enriching himself_, or his _gratifying his own Taste_ with good Food?
