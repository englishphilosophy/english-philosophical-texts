Now the _Causes of Love_ toward the ^Deity^ are infinite; therefore the want of the highest possible Degree of Love to him, must be infinitely evil.—To be excited more by _smaller Motives_ or _Causes_ than by greater; to love those who are less _lovely,_ while we neglect him in whom are _infinite Causes of Love,_ must argue great _Perverseness_ of Affections. But the _Causes of Love_ in the ^Deity,^ his infinite _Goodness_ toward all, and even toward our selves, from whence springs all the Happiness of our Lives, are infinitely above any _Causes of Love_ to be found in _Creatures:_ Therefore to act from Love to them without _Intention_ to please ^God,^ must be infinitely evil.\"","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If this Reasoning be just, the best of Men are infinitely evil.
