That _Ideas,_ to which there is no _Object_ yet existing conformable, are also _different,_ is certain. That upon comparing two _Ideas_ there arises a _relative Idea,_ generally when the two Ideas compared have in them any _Modes of the same simple Idea,_ is also obvious. Thus every _extended Being_ may be compared to any other of the same _Kinds of Dimensions;_ and _relative Ideas_ be formed of _greater, less, equal, double, triple, subduple,_ &c. with infinite variety. This may let us see that Relations are not _real Qualities_ inherent in external Natures, but only _Ideas_ necessarily accompanying our _Perception_ of two Objects at once, and comparing them. _Relative Ideas_ do continue, when the external Objects do not exist, provided we retain the _two Ideas._ But what the _eternal Relations_ in the Natures of Things do mean, is not so easy perhaps to be conceived.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Three sorts of Relationsconsidered.#To shew particularly how far _Morality_ can be concerned in _Relations,_ we may consider them under these Three Classes. 1. The _Relations of inanimate Objects,_ as to their _Quantity,_ or _active_ and _passive Powers,_ as explained by Mr. Locke. 2. The _Relations of inanimate Objects to rational Agents, as to their active or passive Powers._ 3. The _Relations of rational Agents among themselves,_ founded on their _Powers_ or _Actions_ past or continued. Now let us examine what _Fitnesses_ or _Unfitnesses_ arise from any of these _sorts of Relations,_ in which the _Morality_ of Actions may consist; and whether we can place _Morality_ in them, without presupposing a _moral Sense._ 'Tis plain, that ingenious Author says nothing against the Supposition of a _moral Sense:_ But many do imagine, that his Account of moral Ideas is independent upon a moral Sense, and therefore are less willing to allow that we have such an immediate Perception, or Sense of Virtue and Vice. What follows is not intended to oppose his Scheme, but rather to suggest what seems a necessary Explication of it; by shewing that it is no otherwise intelligible, but upon Supposition of a _moral Sense._","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#None of them explain Morality without a Sense.# Relations _of inanimate Objects_ being known, puts it in the Power of a rational Agent often to _diversify_ them, to _change their Forms, Motions,_ or _Qualities_ of any kind, at his pleasure: but no body apprehends any _Virtue_ or _Vice_ in such Actions, where no _Relation_ is apprehended to a _rational Agent's Happiness_ or _Misery;_ otherwise we should have got into the Class of Virtues all the practical _Mathematicks,_ and the Operations of _Chymistry._","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the _Relations of inanimate Objects to rational Agents;_ the Knowledge of them equally puts it in one's Power to _destroy Mankind,_ as to preserve them. Without presupposing _Affections,_ this Knowledge will not excite to one Action rather than another; nor without a _moral Sense_ will it make us approve any Action more than its contrary. The Relation of _Corn_ to human Bodies being known to a Person of _kind Affections,_ was perhaps the _exciting Reason_ of teaching Mankind _Husbandry:_ But the Knowledge of the _Relations of Arsenick_ would excite a _malicious Nature,_ just in the same manner, to the greatest Mischief. A _Sword,_ an _Halter,_ a _Musket,_ bear the _same Relation_ to the Body of an _Hero,_ which they do to a _Robber._ The killing of either is equally agreeable to these _Relations,_ but not equally _good_in a _moral Sense._ The Knowledge of _these Relations_ neither excites to Actions, nor justifies them, without presupposing either _Affections_ or a _moral Sense. Kind Affections_ with such Knowledge makes _Heroes; malicious Affections, Villains._","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The last _sort of Relations_ is that among _rational Agents,_ founded on their _Actions_ or _Affections;_ whence one is called _Creator,_ another _Creature;_ one _Benefactor,_ the other _Beneficiary_ (if that Word may be used in this general Sense;) the one _Parent,_ the other _Child;_ the one _Governor,_ the other _Subject,_ &c. Now let us see what _Fitnesses_ or _Unfitnesses_ arise from these Relations.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is certainly, independently of _Fancy_ or _Custom,_ a _natural Tendency_ in some Actions to give _Pleasure,_ either to the Agent or to others; and a _contrary Tendency_ in other Actions to give _Pain,_ either to the Agent or others: This sort of _Relation_ of Actions to the _Agents_ or _Objects_ is indisputable. If we call these Relations _Fitnesses,_ then the most contrary Actions have _equal Fitnesses_ for contrary Ends; and each one is _unfit_ for the End of the _other._ Thus _Compassion_ is _fit_ to make _others happy,_ and _unfit_ to make others _miserable. Violation of Property is fit_ to make Men _miserable,_ and _unfit_ to make them happy. Each of these is both _fit_ and _unfit,_ with respect to different Ends. The bare _Fitness then to an End,_ is not the Idea of moral Goodness.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Perhaps the _virtuous Fitness_ is that of _Ends._ The Fitness of a _subordinate End_to the ultimate, cannot constitute the Action _good,_ unless the _ultimate End_be good. To _keep a Conspiracy secret_ is not a good _End,_ tho it be fit for obtaining a farther _End,_ the _Success of the Conspiracy._ The _moral Fitness_ must be that of the _ultimate End_itself: The _publick Good_alone is a _fit End,_ therefore the _Means_ fit for this _End_alone are good.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What means the _Fitness of an ultimate End?_ For what is it fit? Why, 'tis an _ultimate End,_ not fit for any thing farther, but _absolutely fit._ What means that Word _fit?_ If it notes a _simple Idea_ it must be the _Perception of some Sense:_ thus we must recur, upon this Scheme too, to a _moral Sense._[n2]","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#Agreement _with_ Relations _presupposes also a_ moral Sense.#If Fitness be not a _simple Idea,_ let it be defined. Some tell us, that it is \"an _Agreement_ of an _Affection, Desire,_ _Action, or End,_ to the _Relations of Agents._\" But what means _Agreement?_ Which of these four Meanings has it? 1. We say one _Quantity_ agrees with another of equal _Dimensions_ every way. 2. A _Corollary_ agrees with a _Theorem;_ when our knowing the latter to be Truth, leads us to know that the former is also a _true Proposition._ 3. _Meat_ agrees with that _Body_ which it tends to _preserve._ 4. Meat agrees with the _Taste_ of that Being in whom it raises a _pleasant Perception._ If any one of these are the Meanings of _Agreement_ in the Definition, then one of these is the Idea of _Fitness._ 1. That an Action or Affection is of the same _Bulk_ and _Figure_ with the _Relation._ Or, 2. When the _Relation_ is a _true Proposition,_ so is the _Action_ or _Affection._ Or, 3. The _Action_ or _Affection_ tends to _preserve_ the Relation; and _contrary Actions_ would destroy it: So that, for instance, ^God^ would be no longer related to us as _Creator_ and _Benefactor,_ when we disobeyed him. Or, 4. The Action raises _pleasant Perceptions_ in the _Relation._ All these Expressions seem absurd.[n3]","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These Gentlemen probably have some other Meanings to these Words _Fitness_ or _Agreement._ I hope what is said will shew the need for _Explication_ of them, tho they be so common.
