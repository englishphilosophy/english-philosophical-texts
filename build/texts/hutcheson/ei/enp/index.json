The second (1730) was merely a reprint of the first, but the third (1742) contained some significant revisions. Consequently the third is our copytext. The text was derived from Aaron Garrett's edition (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2002), which follows the first edition (noting significant differences between this and third). This source text has been substantially altered, to bring the text in line with the 1742 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hutcheson-an-essay-on-the-nature-and-conduct-of-the-passions-and-affections-1742-2002/simple#lf0150_div_017","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£4 AN £4 £1 ESSAY £1 £4 ON THE £4 £3 ^Nature^ and ^Conduct^ £3 £4 OF THE £4 £2 PASSIONS. £2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP"}],"texts":[{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.1","imported":true,"title":"Section 1.
