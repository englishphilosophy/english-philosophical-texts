The first which occur to any one are _Desire_ of the grateful Perceptions, and _Aversion_ to the uneasy, either for ourselves or others. If we would confine the word _Affection_ to these two, which are entirely distinct from all _Sensation_, and directly incline the Mind to _Action_ or _Volition of Motion_, we should have no Debate about the Number or Division of Affections. But since, by universal Custom, this Name is applied to other Modifications of the Mind, such as _Joy_, _Sorrow_, _Despair_, we may consider what universal _Distinction_ can be assigned between these _Modifications_, and the several _Sensations_ abovementioned; and we shall scarce find any other than this, that we call \"the _direct immediate Perception_ of Pleasure or Pain from the present Object or Event, the _Sensation_: \"#Other Affections, wherein different from _Sensation_.# But we denote by the _Affection_ or _Passion_ some other \"_Perceptions_ of Pleasure or Pain, not directly raised by the _Presence_ or _Operation_ of the Event or Object, but by our _Reflection_ upon, or _Apprehension_ of their present or future Existence; so that we expect or judge that the Object or Event will raise the _direct Sensations_ in us.\" In beholding a regular Building we have the _Sensation_ of Beauty; but upon our _apprehending_ ourselves possessed of it, or that we can procure this pleasant Sensation when we please, we feel the _Affection_ of _Joy_. When a Man has a Fit of the Gout, he has the _painful Sensation_; when he is not at present pained, yet apprehends a sudden return of it, he has the _Affection of Sorrow_, which might be called a Sort of _Sensation_: as the Physicians call many of our Passions _internal Senses_.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^When^ the word _Passion_ is imagined to denote any thing different from the _Affections_, it includes a strong Brutal Impulse of the Will, sometimes without any distinct notions of Good, publick or private, attended with \"a[n1] _confused Sensation_ either of Pleasure or Pain, occasioned or attended by some violent bodily Motions, which keeps the Mind much employed upon the present Affair, to the exclusion of every thing else, and prolongs or strengthens the Affection sometimes to such a degree, as to prevent all _deliberate Reasoning_ about our Conduct.\"","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#General Desires, and particular Affections or Passions.# ^We^ have little reason to imagine, that all other Agents have such _confused Sensations_ accompanying their Desires as we often have.

In like manner our publick Desires may be distinguished into the _general calm Desire of the Happiness of others_, or _Aversion to their Misery_ upon Reflection; and the _particular Affections_ or _Passions_ of _Love_, _Congratulation_, _Compassion_, _natural Affection_. These _particular Affections_ are found in many Tempers, where, through want of Reflection, the _general calm Desires_ are not found: Nay, the former may be opposite to the latter, where they are found in the same Temper. Sometimes the calm Motion of the _Will_ conquers the _Passions_, and sometimes is conquered by it. Thus _Lust_ or _Revenge_ may conquer the calm Affection toward private Good, and sometimes are conquered by it. _Compassion_ will prevent the necessary Correction of a Child, or the use of a severe Cure, while the calm _parental_ Affection is exciting to it. Sometimes the latter prevails over the former. All this is beatifully represented in the 9th book of [_Plato_'s _Republick_]. We obtain _Command_ over the _particular Passions_, principally by strengthning the _general Desires_ through frequent Reflection, and making them _habitual_, so as to obtain Strength superior to the _particular Passions_.[n2]","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Again^, the _calm publick Desires_ may be considered as \"they either regard the Good of _particular Persons_ or _Societies_ presented to our Senses; or that of some more abstracted or general Community, such as a _Species_ or System.\" This latter sort we may call _universal calm Benevolence_. Now it is plain, that not only _particular kind Passions_, but even _calm particular Benevolence_ do not always arise from, or necessarily presuppose, the _universal Benevolence_; both the former may be found in Persons of little Reflection, where the latter is wanting: And the former two may be opposite to the other, where they meet together in one Temper.

If this be any sort of _Liberty_, it must be allowed to be in Men, even by those who maintain \"the _Desire_ or _Will_ to be necessarily determined by the _prepollent Motive_;\" since this very _Presumption_ may be a prepollent Motive, especially to those, who by frequent _Attention_ make the Idea of the _greatest Good_ always present to themselves on all important Occasions.

The Pursuit of a small Good by great Toil is really foolish; violent _Labour_ may be as pernicious as any thing else: Why should we be excited to any _uneasy Labour_, except for prepollent Good? And, when the Good is _prepollent_, what need of any further _Incitement_ than the calm Desire of it? The same may be said of the Avocations of _Curiosity_ or _Mirth_; if their _absolute Pleasures_ be greater than that of the good from which they divert us, why should we not be diverted from it?
