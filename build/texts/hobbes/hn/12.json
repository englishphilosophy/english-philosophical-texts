XII. £1","id":"Hobbes.HN.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"IT hath been declared already, how _external_ Objects cause _Conceptions,_ and Conceptions, _Appetite_ and _Fear,_ which are the _first unperceived Beginnings of our Actions:_ for _either_ the Actions immediately follow the first Appetite, as when we do any Thing upon a sudden; _or else_ to our first Appetite there succeedeth some Conception of Evil to happen to us by such Actions, which is Fear, and which holdeth us from proceeding. And to that Fear may succeed a new Appetite, and to that Appetite another Fear alternately, till the Action be either done, or some Accident come between, to make it impossible; and so this alternate Appetite and Fear ceaseth. This _alternate Succession of Appetite and Fear_ during all the time the Action is in our Power to do or not to do, is that we call _Deliberation_; which Name hath been given it for that Part of the Definition wherein it is said that it lasteth so long as the Action, whereof we deliberate, is in our Power: for, so long we have Liberty to do or not to do; and Deliberation signifieth a Taking away of our own Liberty.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Deliberation_ therefore requireth in the Action deliberated _two Conditions_; one, that it be _future_; the other, that there be _Hope_ of doing it, or possibility of not doing it; for, _Appetite_ and _Fear_ are _Expepectations_ of the future; and there is no Expectation of Good, without Hope; or of Evil, without Possibility: of _Necessaries_ therefore there is _no Deliberation._ In Deliberation, the last Appetite, as also the last Fear, is called _Will, viz._ the last Appetite, Will to do, or Will to omit. It is all one therefore to say _Will,_ and _last Will_: for, though a Man express his present Inclination and Appetite concerning the disposing of his Goods, by Words or Writing; yet shall it not be counted his Will, because he hath still Liberty to dispose of them other ways: but when Death taketh away that Liberty, then it is his Will.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Voluntary_ Actions and Omissions are such as have Beginning in the _Will_; all other are _involuntary,_ or _mixed voluntary,_ such as a Man doth upon Appetite or Fear; _involuntary,_ such as he doth by Necessity of Nature, as when he is pushed, or falleth, and thereby doth Good or hurt to another: _mixt,_ such as participate of both; as when a Man is carried to Prison, Going is voluntary, to the Prison, is involuntary: The Example of him that throweth his Goods out of a Ship into the Sea, to save his Person, is of an Action altogether voluntary; for, there is nothing therein involuntary, but the Hardness of the Choice, which is not his Action, but the Action of the Winds: what he himself doth, is no more against his Will, than to flee from Danger is against the Will of him that seeth no other Means to preserve himself.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Voluntary_ also are the Actions that proceed from sudden _Anger,_ or _other_ sudden _Appetite_ in such Men as can discern Good or Evil: for, in them the Time precedent _is_ to be judged Deliberation; for then also he deliberateth in what Cases it is good to _strike,_ deride, or do any other Action proceeding from Anger or other such sudden Passion.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"_Appetite, Fear, Hope,_ and the rest of the Passions are _not_ called _voluntary_; for they proceed _not from, but are the Will,_ and the Will is not voluntary: for, a Man can no more say he will will, than he will will will, and so make an infinite Repetition of the Word _will_; which is absurd, and insignificant.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Forasmuch as _Will to do_ is _Appetite,_ and _Will to omit, Fear_; the _Cause_ of _Appetite_ and _Fear_ is the _Cause_ also of our _Will_: But the propounding of the Benefits and of Harms, that is to say, of Reward and Punishment, is the Cause of our Appetite, and of our Fears, and therefore also of our Wills, so far forth as we believe that such Rewards and Benefits as are propounded, shall arrive unto us; and consequently, our _Wills_ follow our _Opinions,_ as our _Actions_ follow our _Wills_; in which Sense they say truly, and properly, that say the World is governed by Opinion.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When the Wills of many concur to one and the same Action and Effect, this _Concourse_ of their _Wills_ is called _Consent_; by which we must not understand one Will of many Men (for every Man hath his several Will) but many Wills to the producing of one Effect: But when the _Wills_ of two divers Men _produce_ such Actions as are reciprocally _resistant_ one to the other, this is called _Contention_; and, being upon the Persons one of another, _Battel_: whereas Actions proceeding from _Consent,_ are mutual _Aid._","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When many Wills are involved or included in the Will of one or more consenting, (which how it may be, shall be hereafter declared) then is that involving of many Wills in one or more, called _Vnion._","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In _Deliberations_ interrupted, as they may be by _Diversion_ of other Business, or by _Sleep,_ the last _Appetite_ of such Part of the Deliberation is called _Intention,_ or _Purpose._","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.HN.12.9"}]}
