Now seeing _Eternall life_ is a greater reward, than the _life present_; and _Eternall torment_ a greater punishment than the _death of Nature_; It is a thing worthy to be well considered, of all men that desire (by obeying Authority) to avoid the calamities of Confusion, and Civill war, what is meant in holy Scripture, by _Life Eternall_, and _Torment Eternall_; and for what offences, and against whom committed, men are to be _Eternally tormented_; and for what actions, they are to obtain _Eternall life_.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The place of Adams Eternity if he had not sinned, had been the terrestiall Paradise._# And first we find, that Adam was created in such a condition of life, as had he not broken the commandement of God, he had enjoyed it in the Paradise of Eden Everlastingly. For there was the _Tree of life_; whereof he was so long allowed to eat, as he should forbear to eat of the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evill; which was not allowed him. And therefore as soon as he had eaten of it, God thrust him out of Paradise, _lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and live for ever_. By which it seemeth to me, (with submission neverthelesse both in this, and in all questions, whereof the determination dependeth on the Scriptures, to the interpretation of the Bible authorized by the Common-wealth, whose Subject I am,) that Adam if he had not#_Gen. 3. 22._# sinned, had had an Eternall Life on Earth: and that Mortality entred upon himself, and his posterity, by his first Sin. Not that actuall Death then entred; for Adam then could never have had children; whereas he lived long after, and saw a numerous posterity ere he dyed. But where it is said, _In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die_, it must needs bee meant of his Mortality, and certitude of death. Seeing then Eternall life was lost by Adams forfeiture, in committing sin, he that should cancell that forfeiture was to recover thereby, that Life again. Now Jesus Christ hath satisfied for the sins of all that beleeve in him; and therefore recovered to all beleevers, that ^Eternall^ ^Life^, which was lost by the sin of Adam. And in this sense it is, that the comparison of St. Paul holdeth (_Rom_. 5. 18, 19.) _As by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men to Justification of Life_. Which is again (1 _Cor_. 15. 21, 22.) more perspicuously delivered in these words, _For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive_.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Texts concerning the place of Life Eternall, for Beleevers._# Concerning the place wherein men shall enjoy that Eternall Life, which Christ hath obtained for them, the texts next before alledged seem to make it on Earth. For if as in Adam, all die, that is, have forfeited Paradise, and Eternall Life on Earth, even so in Christ all shall bee made alive; then all men shall be made to live on Earth; for else the comparison were not proper. Hereunto seemeth to agree that of the Psalmist, (_Psal_. 133. 3.) _Upon Zion God commanded the blessing, even Life for evermore_: for Zion, is in Jerusalem, upon Earth: as also that of S. Joh. (_Rev_. 2. 7.) _To him that overcommeth I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God_. This was the tree of Adams Eternall life; but his life was to have been on Earth. The same seemeth to be confirmed again by St. Joh. (_Rev_. 21. 2.) where he saith, _I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband:_ and again v. 10. to the same effect: As if he should say, the new Jerusalem, the Paradise of God, at the coming again of Christ, should come down to Gods people from Heaven, and not they goe up to it from Earth. And this differs nothing from that, which the two men in white clothing (that is, the two Angels) said to the Apostles, that were looking upon Christ ascending (_Acts_ I. II.) _This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him go up into Heaven_. Which soundeth as if they had said, he should come down to govern them under his Father, Eternally here; and not take them up to govern them in Heaven; and is conformable to the Restauration of the Kingdom of God, instituted under Moses; which was a Political government of the Jews on Earth. Again, that saying of our Saviour (_Mat_. 22. 30.) _that in the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven_, is a description of an Eternall Life, resembling that which we lost in Adam in the point of Marriage. For seeing Adam, and Eve, if they had not sinned, had lived on Earth Eternally, in their individuall persons; it is manifest, they should not continually have procreated their kind. For if Immortals should have generated, as Mankind doth now; the Earth in a small time, would not have been able to afford them place to stand on. The Jews that asked our Saviour the question, whose wife the woman that had married many brothers, should be, in the resurrection, knew not what were the consequences of Life Eternall: and therefore our Saviour puts them in mind of this consequence of Immortality; that there shal be no Generation, and consequently no marriage, no more than there is Marriage, or generation among the Angels. The comparison between that Eternall life which Adam lost, and our Saviour by his Victory over death hath recovered; holdeth also in this, that as Adam lost Eternall Life by his sin, and yet lived after it for a time; so the faithful Christian hath recovered Eternal Life by Christs passion, though he die a natural death, and remaine dead for a time; namely, till the Resurrection. For as Death is reckoned from the Condemnation of Adam, not from the Execution; so Life is reckoned from the Absolution, not from the Resurrection of them that are elected in Christ.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Ascension into heaven._# That the place wherein men are to live Eternally, after the Resurrection, is the Heavens, meaning by Heaven, those parts of the world, which are the most remote from Earth, as where the stars are, or above the stars, in another Higher Heaven, called _C{oe}lum Empyreum_, (whereof there is no mention in Scripture, nor ground in Reason) is not easily to be drawn from any text that I can find. By the Kingdome of Heaven, is meant the Kingdom of the King that dwelleth in Heaven; and his Kingdome was the people of Israel, whom he ruled by the Prophets his Lieutenants, first Moses, and after him Eleazar, and the Soveraign Priests, till in the days of Samuel they rebelled, and would have a mortall man for their King, after the manner of other Nations. And when our Saviour Christ, by the preaching of his Ministers, shall have perswaded the Jews to return, and called the Gentiles to his obedience, then shall there be a new Kingdom of Heaven; because our King shall then be God, whose _throne_ is Heaven; without any necessity evident in the Scripture, that man shall ascend to his happinesse any higher than Gods _footstool_, the Earth. On the contrary, we find written (_Joh_. 3. 13.) that _no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, that is in Heaven_. Where I observe by the way, that these words are not, as those which go immediately before, the words of our Saviour, but of St. John himself; for Christ was then not in Heaven, but upon the Earth. The like is said of David (_Acts_ 2. 34.) where St. Peter, to prove the Ascension of Christ, using the words of the Psalmist, (_Psal_. 16. 10.) _Thou wilt not leave my soule in Hell, nor suffer thine Holy one to see corruption_, saith, they were spoken (not of David, but) of Christ; and to prove it, addeth this Reason, _For David is not ascended into Heaven_. But to this a man may easily answer, and say, that though their bodies were not to ascend till the generall day of Judgment, yet their souls were in Heaven as soon as they were departed from their bodies; which also seemeth to be confirmed by the words of our Saviour (_Luke_ 20. 37, 38.) who proving the Resurrection out of the words of Moses, saith thus, _That the dead are raised, even Moses shewed, at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the Dead, but of the Living; for they all live to him_. But if these words be to be understood only of the Immortality of the Soul, they prove not at all that which our Saviour intended to prove, which was the Resurrection of the Body, that is to say, the Immortality of the Man. Therefore our Saviour meaneth, that those Patriarchs were Immortall; not by a property consequent to the essence, and nature of mankind; but by the will of God, that was pleased of his mere grace, to bestow _Eternall life_ upon the faithfull. And though at that time the Patriarchs and many other faithfull men were _dead_, yet as it is in the text, they _lived to God_; that is, they were written in the Book of Life with them that were absolved of their sinnes, and ordained to Life eternall at the Resurrection. That the Soul of man is in its own nature Eternall, and a living Creature independent on the body; or that any meer man is Immortall, otherwise than by the Resurrection in the last day, (except _Enos_ and _Elias_,) is a doctrine not apparent in Scripture. The whole 14. Chapter of _Job_, which is the speech not of his friends, but of himselfe, is a complaint of this Mortality of Nature; and yet no contradiction of the Immortality at the Resurrection. _There is hope of a tree_ (saith hee verse 7.) _if it be cast down, Though the root thereof wax old, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet when it senteth the water it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a Plant. But man dyeth, and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?_ and (verse 12.) _man lyeth down, and riseth not, till the heavens be no more_. But when is it, that the heavens shall be no more? St. Peter tells us, that it is at the generall Resurrection. For in his 2. Epistle, 3. Chapter, and 7 verse, he saith, that _the Heavens and the Earth that are now, are reserved unto fire against the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men_, and (verse 12.) _looking for, and hasting to the comming of God, wherein the Heavens shall be on fire, and shall be dissolved, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat. Neverthelesse, we according to the promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse_. Therefore where Job saith, man riseth not till the Heavens be no more; it is all one, as if he had said, the Immortall Life (and Soule and Life in the Scripture, do usually signifie the same thing) beginneth not in man, till the Resurrection, and day of Judgement; and hath for cause, not his specificall nature, and generation; but the Promise. For St. Peter saies not, _Wee look for new heavens, and a new earth_, (_from Nature_,) but _from Promise_.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Lastly, seeing it hath been already proved out of divers evident places of Scripture, in the 35. chapter of this book, that the Kingdom of God is a Civil Common-wealth, where God himself is Soveraign, by vertue first of the _Olà_, and since of the _New_ Covenant, wherein he reigneth by his Vicar, or Lieutenant; the same places do therefore also prove, that after the comming again of our Saviour in his Majesty, and glory, to reign actually, and Eternally; the Kingdom of God is to be on Earth. But because this doctrine (though proved out of places of Scripture not few, nor obscure) will appear to most men a novelty; I doe but propound it; maintaining nothing in this, or any other paradox of Religion; but attending the end of that dispute of the sword, concerning the Authority, (not yet amongst my Countreymen decided,) by which all sorts of doctrine are to bee approved, or rejected; and whose commands, both in speech, and writing, (whatsoever be the opinions of private men) must by all men, that mean to be protected by their Laws, be obeyed.

All which places design metaphorically a grief, and discontent of mind, from the sight of that Eternal felicity in others, which they themselves through their own incredulity, and disobedience have lost. And because such felicity in others, is not sensible but by comparison with their own actuall miseries; it followeth that they are to suffer such bodily paines, and calamities, as are incident to those, who not onely live under evill and cruell Governours, but have also for Enemy, the Eternall King of the Saints, God Almighty. And amongst these bodily paines, is to be reckoned also to every one of the wicked a second Death. For though the Scripture bee clear for an universall Resurrection; yet wee do not read, that to any of the Reprobate is promised an Eternall life.

And I will also take of them for Priests and for Levites, saith the Lord_: Whereby it is manifest, that the chief seat of Gods Kingdome (which is the Place, from whence the Salvation of us that were Gentiles, shall proceed) shall be Jerusalem: And the same is also confirmed by our Saviour, in his discourse with the woman of Samaria, concerning the place of Gods worship; to whom he saith, _John_ 4. 22. that the Samaritans worshipped they knew not what, but the Jews worship what they knew, _For Salvation is of the Jews_ (_ex Jud{ae}is_, that is, begins at the Jews): as if he should say, you worship God, but know not by whom he wil save you, as we doe, that know it shall be by one of the tribe of Judah, a Jew, not a Samaritan. And therefore also the woman not impertinently answered him again, _We know the Messias shall come_. So that which our Saviour saith, _Salvation is from the Jews_, is the same that Paul sayes (_Rom_. 1. 16, 17.) _The Gospel is the power of God to Salvation to every one that beleeveth: To the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousnesse of God revealed from faith to faith_; from the faith of the Jew, to the faith of the Gentile. In the like sense the Prophet _Joel_ describing the day of Judgment, (chap 2. 30, 31.) that God would _shew wonders in heaven, and in earth, bloud, and fire, and pillars of smoak. The Sun should be turned to darknesse, and the Moon into bloud, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come_, he addeth verse 32. _and it shall come to passe, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. For in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem shall be Salvation_. And _Obadiah_ verse 17. saith the same, _Upon Mount Zion shall be Deliverance; and there shall be holinesse, and the house of Jacob shall possesse their possessions_, that is, the possessions of the _Heathen_, which _possessions_ he expresseth more particularly in the following verses, by the _mount of Esau_, the _Land of the Philistines_, the _fields of Ephraim, of Samaria, Gilead_, and the _Cities of the South_, and concludes with these words, _the Kingdom shall be the Lords_. All these places are for Salvation, and the Kingdome of God (after the day of Judgement) upon Earth. On the other side, I have not found any text that can probably be drawn, to prove any Ascension of the Saints into Heaven; that is to say, into any _C{oe}lum Empyreum_, or other {ae}theriall Region; saving that it is called the Kingdome of Heaven: which name it may have, because God, that was King of the Jews, governed them by his commands, sent to Moses by Angels from Heaven; and after their revolt, sent his Son from Heaven, to reduce them to their obedience; and shall send him thence again, to rule both them, and all other faithfull men, from the day of Judgment, Everlastingly: or from that, that the Throne of this our Great King is in Heaven; whereas the Earth is but his Footstoole. But that the Subjects of God should have any place as high as his Throne, or higher than his Footstoole, it seemeth not sutable to the dignity of a King, nor can I find any evident text for it in holy Scripture.","subId":"25","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From this that hath been said of the Kingdom of God, and of Salvation, it is not hard to interpret what is meant by the ^World to come^. There are three worlds mentioned in Scripture, the _Old World_, the _Present World_, and the _World to come_. Of the first, St. Peter speaks,#_2 Pet. 2. 5._# _If God spared not the Old World, but saved Noah the eighth person, a Preacher of righteousnesse, bringing the flood upon the world of the ungodly_, &_c_. So the _first World,_ was from Adam to the generall Flood. Of the present World, our Saviour speaks (_John_ 18. 36.) My _Kingdome is not of this World_. For he came onely to teach men the way of Salvation, and to renew the Kingdome of his Father, by his doctrine. Of the World to come, St. Peter#_2 Pet. 3. 13._# speaks, _Neverthelesse we according to his promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth_. This is that ^World^, wherein Christ coming down from Heaven, in the clouds, with great power, and glory, shall send his Angels, and shall gather together his elect, from the four winds, and from the uttermost parts of the Earth, and thence forth reign over them, (under his Father) Everlastingly.","subId":"26","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Redemption._# _Salvation_ of a sinner, supposeth a precedent ^Redemption^; for he that is once guilty of Sin, is obnoxious to the Penalty of the same; and must pay (or some other or him) such Ransome, as he that is offended, and has him in his power, shall require. And seeing the person offended, is Almighty God, in whose power are all things; such Ransome is to be paid before Salvation can be acquired, as God hath been pleased to require. By this Ransome, is not intended a satisfaction for Sin, equivalent to the Offence, which no sinner for himselfe, nor righteous man can ever be able to make for another: The dammage a man does to another, he may make amends for by restitution, or recompence, but sin cannot be taken away by recompence; for that were to make the liberty to sin, a thing vendible. But sins may bee pardoned to the repentant, either _gratis_, or upon such penalty, as God is pleased to accept. That which God usually accepted in the Old Testament, was some Sacrifice, or Oblation. To forgive sin is not an act of Injustice, though the punishment have been threatned. Even amongst men, though the promise of Good, bind the promiser; yet threats, that is to say, promises of Evill, bind them not; much lesse shall they bind God, who is infinitely more merciful then men. Our Saviour Christ therefore to _Redeem_ us, did not in that sense satisfie for the Sins of men, as that his Death, of its own vertue, could make it unjust in God to punish sinners with Eternall death; but did make that Sacrifice, and Oblation of himself, at his first coming, which God was pleased to require, for the Salvation at his second coming, of such as in the mean time should repent, and beleeve in him. And though this act of our _Redemption_, be not alwaies in Scripture called a _Sacrifice_, and _Oblation_, but sometimes a _Price_; yet by _Price_ we are not to understand any thing, by the value whereof, he could claim right to a pardon for us, from his offended Father; but that Price which God the Father was pleased in mercy to demand.","subId":"27","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.27"}]}
