In which manner he _reigned_ over Adam, and gave him commandement to abstaine from the tree of cognizance of Good and Evill; which when he obeyed not, but tasting thereof, took upon him to be as God, judging between Good and Evill, not by his Creators commandement, but by his own sense, his punishment was a privation of the estate of Eternall life, wherein God had at first created him: And afterwards God punished his posterity, for their vices, all but eight persons, with an universall deluge; And in these eight did consist the then _Kingdom of God_.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"After this, it pleased God to speak to Abraham,#_The originall of the Kingdome of God._# and (_Gen_. 17. 7, 8.) to make a Covenant with him in these words, _I will establish my Covenant between me, and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee; And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession_. In this Covenant _Abraham promiseth for himselfe and his posterity to obey as God, the Lord that spake to him: and God on his part promiseth to Abraham the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession_. And for a memoriall, and a token of this Covenant, he ordaineth (verse 11.) the _Sacrament of Circumcision_. This is it which is called the _Old Covenant_, or _Testament_; and containeth a Contract between God and Abraham; by which Abraham obligeth himself, and his posterity, in a peculiar manner to be subject to Gods positive Law; for to the Law Morall he was obliged before, as by an Oath of Allegiance. And though the name of _King_ be not yet given to God, nor of _Kingdome_ to Abraham and his seed; yet the thing is the same; namely, an Institution by pact, of Gods peculiar Soveraignty over the seed of Abraham; which in the renewing of the same Covenant by Moses, at Mount Sinai, is expressely called a peculiar _Kingdome of God_ over the Jews: and it is of Abraham (not of Moses) St. Paul saith (_Rom_. 4. 11.) that he is the _Father of the Faithfull_; that is, of those that are loyall, and doe not violate their Allegiance sworn to God, then by Circumcision, and afterwards in the _New Covenant_ by Baptisme.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_That the Kingdome of God is properly his Civill Soveraignty over a peculiar people by pact._# This Covenant, at the Foot of Mount Sinai, was renewed by Moses (_Exod_. 19. 5.) where the Lord commandeth Moses to speak to the people in this manner, _If you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then yee shall be a peculiar people to me, for all the Earth is mine; And yee shall be unto me a Sacerdotall Kingdome, and an holy Nation_. For a _Peculiar people_, the vulgar Latine hath, _Peculium de cunctis populis_: the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King James, hath, a _Peculiar treasure unto me above all Nations_; and the Geneva French, _the most precious Jewel of all Nations_. But the truest Translation is the first, because it is confirmed by St. Paul himself (_Tit_. 2. 14.) where he saith, alluding to that place, that our blessed Saviour _gave himself for us, that he might purifie us to himself, a peculiar_ (that is, an extraordinary) _people:_ for the word is in the Greek περιούσιος which is opposed commonly to the word ἐπιούσιος: and as this signifieth _ordinary, quotidian_, or (as in the Lords Prayer) _of daily use_; so the other signifieth that which is _overplus_, and _stored up_, and _enjoyed in a speciall manner_; which the Latines call _Peculium_: and this meaning of the place is confirmed by the reason God rendereth of it, which followeth immediately, in that he addeth, _For all the Earth is mine_, as if he should say, _All the Nations of the world are mine_; but it is not so that you are mine, but in a _speciall manner_: For they are all mine, by reason of my Power; but you shall be mine, by your own Consent, and Covenant; which is an addition to his ordinary title, to all nations.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The same is again confirmed in expresse words in the same text, _Yee shall be to me a Sacerdotall Kingdome, and an holy Nation_. The Vulgar Latine hath it, _Regnum Sacerdotale_, to which agreeth the Translation of that place (1 _Pet_. 2. 9.) _Sacerdotium Regale, a Regal Priesthood_; as also the Institution it self, by which no man might enter into the _Sanctum Sanctorum_, that is to say, no man might enquire Gods will immediately of God himselfe, but onely the High Priest. The English Translation before mentioned, following that of Geneva, has, a _Kingdom of Priests_; which is either meant of the succession of one High Priest after another, or else it accordeth not with St. Peter, nor with the exercise of the High priesthood: For there was never any but the High priest onely, that was to informe the People of Gods Will; nor any Convocation of Priests ever allowed to enter into the _Sanctum Sanctorum_.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Again, the title of a _Holy Nation_ confirmes the same: for _Holy_ signifies, that which is Gods by speciall, not by generall Right. All the Earth (as is said in the text) is Gods; but all the Earth is not called _Holy_, but that onely which is set apart for his especiall service, as was the Nation of the Jews. It is therefore manifest enough by this one place, that by the _Kingdome of God_, is properly meant a Common-wealth, instituted (by the consent of those which were to be subject thereto) for their Civill Government, and the regulating of their behaviour, not onely towards God their King, but also towards one another in point of justice, and towards other Nations both in peace and warre; which properly was a Kingdome, wherein God was King, and the High priest was to be (after the death of Moses) his sole Viceroy, or Lieutenant.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But there be many other places that clearly prove the same. As first (1 _Sam_. 8. 7.) when the Elders of Israel (grieved with the corruption of the Sons of Samuel) demanded a King, Samuel displeased there-with, prayed unto the Lord; and the Lord answering said unto him, _Hearken unto the voice of the People, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them._ Out of which it is evident, that God himself was then their King; and Samuel did not command the people, but only delivered to them that which God from time to time appointed him.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Again, (1 _Sam_. 12. 12.) where Samuel saith to the People, _When yee saw that Nahash King of the Children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a King shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your King:_ It is manifest that God was their King, and governed the Civill State of their Common-wealth.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And after the Israelites had rejected God, the Prophets did foretell his restitution; as (_Isaiah_ 24. 23.) _Then the Moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem_; where he speaketh expressely of his Reign in Zion, and Jerusalem; that is, on Earth. And (_Micah_ 4. 7.) _And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion_: This Mount Zion is in Jerusalem upon the Earth. And (_Ezek_. 20. 33.) _As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and a stretched out arme, and with fury powred out, I wil rule over you; and_ (verse 37.) _I will cause you to passe under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant_; that is, I will reign over you, and make you to stand to that Covenant which you made with me by Moses, and brake in your rebellion against me in the days of Samuel, and in your election of another King.","subId":"10","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And in the New Testament, the Angel Gabriel saith of our Saviour (_Luke_ 1. 32, 33.) _He shall be great, and be called the Son of the most High, and the Lord shall_ _give him the throne of his Father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his King dome there shall be no end_. This is also a Kingdome upon Earth; for the claim whereof, as an enemy to C{ae}sar, he was put to death; the title of his crosse, was, _Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews_; hee was crowned in scorn with a crown of Thornes; and for the proclaiming of him, it is said of the Disciples (_Acts_ 17. 7.) _That they did all of them contrary to the decrees of C{ae}sar, saying there was another King, one Jesus._ The Kingdome therefore of God, is a reail, not a metaphoricall Kingdome; and so taken, not onely in the Old Testament, but the New; when we say, _For thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and Glory_, it is to be understood of Gods Kingdome, by force of our Covenant, not by the Right of Gods Power; for such a Kingdome God alwaies hath; so that it were superfluous to say in our prayer, _Thy Kingdome come_, unlesse it be meant of the Restauration of that Kingdome of God by Christ, which by revolt of the Israelites had been interrupted in the election of Saul. Nor had it been proper to say, _The Kingdome of Heaven is at hand_; or to pray, _Thy Kingdome come_, if it had still continued.","subId":"11","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There be so many other places that confirm this interpretation, that it were a wonder there is no greater notice taken of it, but that it gives too much light to Christian Kings to see their right of Ecclesiasticall Government. This they have observed, that in stead of a _Sacerdotall Kingdome_, translate, _a Kingdome of Priests_: for they may as well translate a _Royall Priesthood_, (as it is in St. Peter) into a _Priesthood of Kings_. And whereas, for a _peculiar people_, they put a _pretious jewel_, or _treasure_, a man might as well call the speciall Regiment, or Company of a Generall, the Generalls pretious Jewel, or his Treasure.","subId":"12","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In short, the Kingdome of God is a Civill Kingdome; which consisted, first in the obligation of the people of Israel to those Laws, which Moses should bring unto them from Mount Sinai; and which afterwards the High Priest for the time being, should deliver to them from before the _Cherubins_ in the _Sanctum Sanctorum_; and which Kingdome having been cast off, in the election of Saul, the Prophets foretold, should be restored by Christ; and the Restauration whereof we daily pray for, when we say in the Lords Prayer, _Thy Kingdome come_; and the Right whereof we acknowledge, when we adde, _For thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and Glory, for ever, and ever, Amen_; and the Proclaiming whereof, was the Preaching of the Apostles; and to which men are prepared, by the Teachers of the Gospel; to embrace which Gospel, (that is to say, to promise obedience to Gods government) is, to bee in the _Kingdome of Grace_, because God hath _gratis_ given to such the power to bee the Subjects (that is, Children of God hereafter, when Christ shall come in Majesty to judge the world, and actually to govern his owne people, which is called _the Kingdome of Glory_. If the Kingdome of God (called also the Kingdome of Heaven, from the gloriousnesse, and admirable height of that throne) were not a Kingdome which God by his Lieutenants, or Vicars, who deliver his Commandements to the people, did exercise on Earth; there would not have been so much contention, and warre, about who it is, by whom God speaketh to us; neither would many Priests have troubled themselves with Spiritual Jurisdiction, nor any King have denied it them.","subId":"13","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Holy what._# Out of this literall interpretation of the _Kingdome of God_, ariseth also the true interpretation of the word ^Holy^.

And God the King of Israel was the _Holy one_ of Israel. The Nation which is subject to one earthly Soveraign, is the Nation of that Soveraign, that is, of the Publique Person. So the Jews, who were Gods Nation, were called (_Exod_. 19. 6.) _a Holy Nation_. For by _Holy_, is alwaies understood, either God himselfe, or that which is Gods in propriety; as by Publique, is alwaies meant either the Person of the Common-wealth it self, or something that is so the Common-wealths, as no private person can claim any propriety therein.","subId":"15","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Therefore the Sabbath (Gods day) is a _Holy day_; the Temple, (Gods house) _a Holy house_; Sacrifices, Tithes, and Offerings (Gods tribute) _Holy duties_; Priests, Prophets, and anointed Kings, under Christ (Gods Ministers) _Holy men_; the C{oe}lestiall ministring Spirits (Gods Messengers) _Holy Angels_; and the like: and wheresoever the word Holy is taken properly, there is still something signified of Propriety, gotten by consent. In saying _Hallowed be thy name_, we do but pray to God for grace to keep the first Commandement, of _having no other Gods but him_.

In the proper sense, that which is made _Holy_#_Sacred what._# by Gods appropriating or separating it to his own use, is said to be _sanctified_ by God, as the Seventh day in the fourth Commandement; and as the Elect in the New Testament were said to bee _sanctified_, when they were endued with the Spirit of godlinesse. And that which is made Holy by the dedication of men, and given to God, so as to be used onely in his publique service, is called also ^Sacred^, and said to be consecrated, as Temples, and other Houses of Publique Prayer, and their Utensils, Priests, and Ministers, Victimes, Offerings, and the externall matter of Sacraments.","subId":"17","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of _Holinesse_ there be degrees: for of those things#_Degrees of Sanctity._# that are set apart for the service of God, there may bee some set apart again, for a neerer and more especial service.

In the Old Testament, the sign of Admission was _Circumcision_; in the New Testament, _Baptisme_. The Commemoration of it in the Old Testament, was the _Eating_ (at a certaine time, which was Anniversary) of the _Paschall Lamb_; by which they were put in mind of the night wherein they were delivered out of their bondage in Egypt; and in the New Testament, the celebrating of the _Lords Supper_; by which, we are put in mind, of our deliverance from the bondage of sin, by our Blessed Saviours death upon the crosse. The Sacraments of _Admission_, are but once to be used, because there needs but one _Admission_; but because we have need of being often put in mind of our deliverance, and of our Alleagance, the Sacraments of _Commemoration_ have need to be reiterated. And these are the principall Sacraments, and as it were the solemne oathes we make of our Alleageance. There be also other Consecrations, that may be called Sacraments, as the word implyeth onely Consecration to Gods service; but as it implies an oath, or promise of Alleageance to God, there were no other in the Old Testament, but _Circumcision_, and the _Passeover_; nor are there any other in the New Testament, but _Baptisme_, and the _Lords Supper_.","subId":"19","id":"Hobbes.L.3.35.19"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.L.3","imported":true,"title":"The Third Part, Of A Christian Common-wealth","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1651]}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.34","imported":true,"title":"Of the Signification of Spirit, Angel, and Inspiration in the Books of Holy Scripture","breadcrumb":"Chapter 34","published":[1651]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.36","imported":true,"title":"Of the Word of God, and of Prophets","breadcrumb":"Chapter 36","published":[1651]}}
