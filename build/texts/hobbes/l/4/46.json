The Savages#_Of the Beginnings and Progresse of Philosophy._# of America, are not without some good Morall Sentences; also they have a little Arithmetick, to adde, and divide in Numbers not too great: but they are not therefore Philosophers. For as there were Plants of Corn and Wine in small quantity dispersed in the Fields and Woods, before men knew their vertue, or made use of them for their nourishment, or planted them apart in Fields, and Vineyards; in which time they fed on Akorns, and drank Water: so also there have been divers true, generall, and profitable Speculations from the beginning; as being the naturall plants of humane Reason: But they were at first but few in number; men lived upon grosse Experience; there was no Method; that is to say, no Sowing, nor Planting of Knowledge by it self, apart from the Weeds, and common Plants of Errour and Conjecture: And the cause of it being the want of leasure from procuring the necessities of life, and defending themselves against their neighbors, it was impossible, till the erecting of great Common-wealths, it should be otherwise. _Leasure_ is the mother of _Philosophy_; and _Common-wealth_, the mother of _Peace_, and _Leasure_: Where first were great and flourishing _Cities_, there was first the study of _Philosophy_. The _Gymnosophists_ of _India_, the _Magi_ of _Persia_, and the _Priests_ of _Chald{ae}a_ and _Egypt_, are counted the most ancient Philosophers; and those Countreys were the most ancient of Kingdomes. _Philosophy_ was not risen to the _Gr{ae}cians_, and other people of the West, whose _Common-wealths_ (no greater perhaps then _Lucca_, or _Geneva_) had never _Peace_, but when their fears of one another were equall; nor the _Leasure_ to observe any thing but one another. At length, when Warre had united many of these _Gr{ae}cian_ lesser Cities, into fewer, and greater; then began _Seven men_, of severall parts of _Greece_, to get the reputation of being _Wise_; some of them for _Morall_ and _Politique_ Sentences; and others for the learning of the _Chald{ae}ans_ and _Egyptians_, which was _Astronomy_, and _Geometry_.

Every Master took some place for that purpose. _Plato_ in certain publique Walks called _Academia_, from one _Academus_: _Aristotle_ in the Walk of the Temple of _Pan_, called _Lyc{ae}um:_ others in the _Stoa_, or covered Walk, wherein the Merchants Goods were brought to land: others in other places; where they spent the time of their Leasure, in teaching or in disputing of their Opinions: and some in any place, where they could get the youth of the City together to hear them talk. And this was it which _Carneades_ also did at _Rome_, when he was Ambassadour: which caused _Cato_ to advise the Senate to dispatch him quickly, for feare of corrupting the manners of the young men that delighted to hear him speak (as they thought) fine things.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From this it was, that the place where any of them taught, and disputed, was called _Schola_, which in their Tongue signifieth _Leasure_; and their Disputations, _Diatrib{oe}_, that is to say, _Passing of the time_.

There were many that studied that Science to the great advantage of mankind: but there is no mention of their Schools; nor was there any Sect of Geometricians; nor did they then passe under the name of Philosophers. The naturall Philosophy of those Schools, was rather a Dream than Science, and set forth in senselesse and insignificant Language; which cannot be avoided by those that will teach Philosophy, without having first attained great knowledge in Geometry: For Nature worketh by Motion; the Wayes, and Degrees whereof cannot be known, without the knowledge of the Proportions and Properties of Lines, and Figures. Their Morall Philosophy is but a description of their own Passions. For the rule of Manners, without Civill Government, is the Law of Nature; and in it, the Law Civill; that determineth what is _Honest_, and _Dishonest_; what is _Just_, and _Unjust_; and generally what is _Good_, and _Evill_: whereas they make the Rules of _Good_, and _Bad_, by their own _Liking_, and _Disliking_: By which means, in so great diversity of taste, there is nothing generally agreed on; but every one doth (as far as he dares) whatsoever seemeth good in his owne eyes, to the subversion of Common-wealth. Their _Logique_ which should bee the Method of Reasoning, is nothing else but Captions of Words, and Inventions how to puzzle such as should goe about to pose them. To conclude, there is nothing so absurd, that the old Philosophers (as _Cicero_ saith, who was one of them) have not some of them maintained. And I beleeve that scarce any thing can be more absurdly said in naturall Philosophy, than that which now is called _Aristotles Metaphysiques_; nor more repugnant to Government, than much of that hee hath said in his _Politiques_; nor more ignorantly, than a great part of his _Ethiques_.","subId":"11","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The Schools of the Jews unprofitable._# The Schoole of the Jews, was originally a Schoole of the Law of _Moses_; who commanded (_Deut_. 31. 10.) that at the end of every seventh year, at the Feast of the Tabernacles, it should be read to all the people, that they might hear, and learn it: Therefore the reading of the Law (which was in use after the Captivity) every Sabbath day, ought to have had no other end, but the acquainting of the people with the Commandements which they were to obey, and to expound unto them the writings of the Prophets. But it is manifest, by the many reprehensions of them by our Saviour, that they corrupted the Text of the Law with their false Commentaries, and vain Traditions; and so little understood the Prophets, that they did neither acknowledge Christ, nor the works he did; of which the Prophets prophecyed. So that by their Lectures and Disputations in their Synagogues, they turned the Doctrine of their Law into a Phantasticall kind of Philosophy, concerning the incomprehensible nature of God, and of Spirits; which they compounded of the Vain Philosophy and Theology of the Gr{ae}cians, mingled with their own fancies, drawn from the obscurer places of the Scripture, and which might most easily bee wrested to their purpose; and from the Fabulous Traditions of their Ancestors.","subId":"12","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That which is now called an _University_, is a Joyning#_University what it is._# together, and an Incorporation under one Government of many Publique Schools, in one and the same Town or City.

There is a certain _Philosophia Prima_, on which all other Philosophy ought to depend; and consisteth principally, in right limiting of the significations of such Appellations, or Names, as are of all others the most Universall: Which Limitations serve to avoid ambiguity, and {ae}quivocation in Reasoning; and are commonly called Definitions; such as are the Definitions of Body, Time, Place, Matter, Forme, Essence, Subject, Substance, Accident, Power, Act, Finite, Infinite, Quantity, Quality, Motion, Action. Passion, and divers others, necessary to the explaining of a mans Conceptions concerning the Nature and Generation of Bodies. The Explication (that is, the setling of the meaning) of which, and the like Terms, is commonly in the Schools called _Metaphysiques_; as being a part of the Philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title: but it is in another sense; for there it signifieth as much, as _Books written, or placed after his naturall Philosophy_: But the Schools take them for _Books of supernaturall Philosophy_: for the word _Metaphysiques_ will bear both these senses.

Also I ask pardon of those that are not used to this kind of Discourse, for applying my selfe to those that are. The World, (I mean not the Earth onely, that denominates the Lovers of it _Worldly men_, but the _Universe_, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth, and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe, is Body; and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And because the Universe is All, that which is no part of it, is _Nothing_; and consequently _no where_. Nor does it follow from hence, that Spirits are _nothing_: for they have dimensions, and are therefore really _Bodies_; though that name in common Speech be given to such Bodies onely, as are visible, or palpable; that is, that have some degree of Opacity: But for Spirits, they call them Incorporeall; which is a name of more honour, and may therefore with more piety bee attributed to God himselfe; in whom wee consider not what Attribute expresseth best his Nature, which is Incomprehensible; but what best expresseth our desire to honour Him.","subId":"15","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To know now upon what grounds they say there be_Essences Abstract_, or _Substantiall Formes_, wee are to consider what those words do properly signifie. The use of Words, is to register to our selves, and make manifest to others the Thoughts and Conceptions of our Minds. Of which Words, some are the names of the Things conceived; as the names of all sorts of Bodies, that work upon the Senses, and leave an Impression in the Imaginations: Others are the names of the Imaginations themselves; that is to say, of those Ideas, or mentall Images we have of all things wee see, or remember: And others againe are names of Names; or of different sorts of Speech: As _Universall, Plurall, Singular_, are the names of Names; and _Definition, Affirmation, Negation, True, False, Syllogisme, Interrogation, Promise, Covenant_, are the names of certain Forms of Speech. Others serve to shew the Consequence, or Repugnance of one name to another; as when one saith, _A Man is a Body_, hee intendeth that the name of _Body_ is necessarily consequent to the name of _Man_; as being but severall names of the same thing, _Man_; which Consequence is signified by coupling them together with the word _Is_. And as wee use the Verbe _Is_; so the Latines use their Verbe _Est_, and the Greeks their Εστι through all its Declinations. Whether all other Nations of the world have in their severall languages a word that answereth to it, or not, I cannot tell; but I am sure they have not need of it: For the placing of two names in order may serve to signifie their Consequence, if it were the custome, (for Custome is it, that give words their force,) as well as the words _Is_, or _Bee_, or _Are_, and the like.","subId":"16","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And if it were so, that there were a Language without any Verb answerable to _Est_, or _Is_, or _Bee_; yet the men that used it would bee not a jot the lesse capable of Inferring, Concluding, and of all kind of Reasoning, than were the Greeks, and Latines. But what then would become of these Terms, of _Entity, Essence, Essentiall, Essentiality_, that are derived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most commonly they are? They are therefore no Names of Things; but Signes, by which wee make known, that wee conceive the Consequence of one name or Attribute to another: as when we say, _a Man, is, a living Body_, wee mean not that the _Man_ is one thing, the _Living Body_ another, and the _Is_, or _Beeing_ a third: but that the _Man_, and the _Living Body_, is the same thing; because the Consequence, _If hee bee a Man, hee is a living Body_, is a true Consequence, signified by that word Is. Therefore, _to bee a Body, to Walke, to bee Speaking, to Live, to See_, and the like Infinitives; also _Corporeity, Walking, Speaking, Life, Sight_, and the like, that signifie just the same, are the names of _Nothing_; as I have elsewhere more amply expressed.","subId":"17","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the doctrine of Government and Obedience?

For it is upon this ground, that when a Man is dead and buried, they say his Soule (that is his Life) can walk separated from his Body, and is seen by night amongst the graves. Upon the same ground they say, that the Figure, and Colour, and Tast of a peece of Bread, has a being, there, where they say there is no Bread: And upon the same ground they say, that Faith, and Wisdome, and other Vertues are sometimes _powred_ into a man, sometimes _blown_ into him from Heaven; as if the Vertuous, and their Vertues could be asunder; and a great many other things that serve to lessen the dependance of Subjects on the Soveraign Power of their Countrey. For who will endeavour to obey the Laws, if he expect Obedience to be Powred or Blown into him? Or who will not obey a Priest, that can make God, rather than his Soveraign; nay than God himselfe? Or who, that is in fear of Ghosts, will not bear great respect to those that can make the Holy Water, that drives them from him? And this shall suffice for an example of the Errors, which are brought into the Church, from the _Entities_, and _Essences_ of Aristotle: which it may be he knew to be false Philosophy; but writ it as a thing consonant to, and corroborative of their Religion; and fearing the fate of Socrates.","subId":"18","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Being once fallen into this Error of _Separated Essences_, they are thereby necessarily involved in many other absurdities that follow it.
