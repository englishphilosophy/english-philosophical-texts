For whatsoever is so tyed, or environed, as it cannot move, but within a certain space, which space is determined by the opposition of some externall body, we say it hath not Liberty to go further. And so of all living creatures, whilest they are imprisoned, or restrained, with walls, or chayns; and of the water whilest it is kept in by banks, or vessels, that otherwise would spread it selfe into a larger space, we use to say, they are not at Liberty, to move in such manner, as without those externall impediments they would. But when the impediment of motion, is in the constitution of the thing it selfe, we use not to say, it wants the Liberty; but the Power to move; as when a stone lyeth still, or a man is fastned to his bed by sicknesse.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the word, _A_ ^Free^-^Man^, _is he, that in those_#_What it is to be Free._# _things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will to_. But when the words _Free_, and _Liberty_, are applyed to any thing but _Bodies_, they are abused; for that which is not subject to Motion, is not subject to Impediment: And therefore, when 'tis said (for example) The way is Free, no Liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk in it without stop. And when we say a Guift is Free, there is not meant any Liberty of the Guift, but of the Giver, that was not bound by any law, or Covenant to give it. So when we _speak Freely_, it is not the Liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath obliged to speak otherwise then he did. Lastly, from the use of the word _Free-will_, no Liberty can be inferred of the will, desire, or inclination, but the Liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Feare and Liberty consistent._# Feare, and Liberty are consistent; as when a man throweth his goods into the Sea for _feare_ the ship should sink, he doth it neverthelesse very willingly, and may refuse to doe it if he will: It is therefore the action, of one that was _free_: so a man sometimes pays his debt, only for _feare_ of Imprisonment, which because no body hindred him from detaining, was the action of a man at _liberty_.

So that to him that could see the connexion of those causes, the _necessity_ of all mens voluntary actions, would appeare manifest. And therefore God, that seeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the _liberty_ of man in doing what he will, is accompanied with the _necessity_ of doing that which God will, & no more, nor lesse. For though men may do many things, which God does not command, nor is therefore Author of them; yet they can have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods will is not the cause. And did not his will assure the _necessity_ of mans will, and consequently of all that on mans will dependeth, the _liberty_ of men would be a contradiction, and impediment to the omnipotence and _liberty_ of God. And this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of that naturall _liberty_, which only is properly called _liberty_.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Artificiall Bonds, or Covenants._# But as men, for the atteyning of peace, and conservation of themselves thereby, have made an Artificiall Man, which we call a Common-wealth; so also have they made Artificiall Chains, called _Civill Lawes_, which they themselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips of that Man, or Assembly, to whom they have given the Soveraigne Power; and at the other end to their own Ears. These Bonds in their own nature but weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not by the difficulty of breaking them.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In relation to these Bonds only it is, that I am#_Liberty of Subjects consisteth in Liberty from covenants._# to speak now, of the _Liberty_ of _Subjects_. For seeing there is no Common-wealth in the world, wherein there be Rules enough set down, for the regulating of all the actions, and words of men, (as being a thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that in all kinds of actions, by the laws pr{ae}termitted, men have the Liberty, of doing what their own reasons shall suggest, for the most profitable to themselves. For if wee take Liberty in the proper sense, for corporall Liberty; that is to say, freedome from chains, and prison, it were very absurd for men to clamor as they doe, for the Liberty they so manifestly enjoy. Againe, if we take Liberty, for an exemption from Lawes, it is no lesse absurd, for men to demand as they doe, that Liberty, by which all other men may be masters of their lives. And yet as absurd as it is, this is it they demand; not knowing that the Lawes are of no power to protect them, without a Sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to be put in execution. The Liberty of a Subject, lyeth therefore only in those things, which in regulating their actions, the Soveraign hath pr{ae}termitted: such as is the Liberty to buy, and sell, and otherwise contract with one another; to choose their own aboad, their own diet, their own trade of life, and institute their children as they themselves think fit; & the like.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Neverthelesse we are not to understand, that by such#_Liberty of the Subject consistent with the unlimited power of the Soveraign._# Liberty, the Soveraign Power of life, and death, is either abolished, or limited. For it has been already shewn, that nothing the Soveraign Representative can doe to a Subject, on what pretence soever, can properly be called Injustice, or Injury; because every Subject is Author of every act the Soveraign doth; so that he never wanteth Right to any thing, otherwise, than as he himself is the Subject of God, and bound thereby to observe the laws of Nature. And therefore it may, and doth often happen in Common-wealths, that a Subject may be put to death, by the command of the Soveraign Power; and yet neither doe the other wrong: As when _Jeptha_ caused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like cases, he that so dieth, had Liberty to doe the action, for which he is neverthelesse, without Injury put to death. And the same holdeth also in a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an Innocent Subject. For though the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to Equitie, (as was the killing of _Uriah_, by _David_;) yet it was not an Injurie to _Uriah_; but to _God_. Not to _Uriah_, because the right to doe what he pleased, was given him by _Uriah_ himself: And yet to _God_, because _David_ was _Gods_ Subject; and prohibited all Iniquitie by the law of Nature. Which distinction, _David_ himself, when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, saying, _To thee only have I sinned_. In the same manner, the people of _Athens_, when they banished the most potent of their Common-wealth for ten years, thought they committed no Injustice; and yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he would doe: Nay they commanded the banishment of they knew not whom; and every Citizen bringing his Oystershell into the market place, written with the name of him he desired should be banished, without actuall accusing him, sometimes banished an _Aristides_, for his reputation of Justice; And sometimes a scurrilous Jester, as _Hyperbolus_, to make a Jest of it. And yet a man cannot say, the Soveraign People of _Athens_ wanted right to banish them; or an _Athenian_ the Libertie to Jest, or to be Just.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The Liberty which writers praise, is the Liberty of Soveraigns; not of Private men._# The Libertie, whereof there is so frequent, and honourable mention, in the Histories, and Philosophy of the Antient Greeks, and Romans, and in the writings, and discourse of those that from them have received all their learning in the Politiques, is not the Libertie of Particular men; but the Libertie of the Common-wealth: which is the same with that, which every man then should have, if there were no Civil Laws, nor Common-wealth at all. And the effects of it also be the same. For as amongst masterlesse men, there is perpetuall war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the Son, nor to expect from the Father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a full and absolute Libertie in every Particular man: So in States, and Common-wealths not dependent on one another, every Common-wealth, (not every man) has an absolute Libertie, to doe what it shall judge (that is to say, what that Man, or Assemblie that representeth it, shall judge) most conducing to their benefit. But withall, they live in the condition of a perpetuall war, and upon the confines of battel, with their frontiers armed, and canons planted against their neighbours round about. The _Athenians_, and _Romanes_ were free; that is, free Common-wealths: not that any particular men had the Libertie to resist their own Representative; but that their Representative had the Libertie to resist, or invade other people. There is written on the Turrets of the city of _Luca_ in great characters at this day, the word _LIBERTAS_; yet no man can thence inferre, that a particular man has more Libertie, or Immunitie from the service of the Commonwealth there, than in _Constantinople_. Whether a Common-wealth be Monarchicall, or Popular, the Freedome is still the same.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But it is an easy thing, for men to be deceived, by the specious name of Libertie; and for want of Judgement to distinguish, mistake that for their Private Inheritance, and Birth right, which is the right of the Publique only. And when the same errour is confirmed by the authority of men in reputation for their writings in this subject, it is no wonder if it produce sedition, and change of Government. In these westerne parts of the world, we are made to receive our opinions concerning the Institution, and Rights of Common-wealths, from _Aristotle, Cicero_, and other men, Greeks and Romanes, that living under Popular States, derived those Rights, not from the Principles of Nature, but transcribed them into their books, out of the Practise of their own Common-wealths, which were Popular; as the Grammarians describe the Rules of Language, out of the Practise of the time; or the Rules of Poetry, out of the Poems of _Homer_ and _Virgil_. And because the Athenians were taught, (to keep them from desire of changing their Government,) that they were Freemen, and all that lived under Monarchy were slaves; therefore _Aristotle_ puts it down in his _Politiques_, (_lib_. 6. _cap_. 2.) _In democracy_, Liberty _is to be supposed: for 'tis commonly held, that no man is_ Free _in any other Government_. And as _Aristotle_; so _Cicero_, and other Writers have grounded their Civill doctrine, on the opinions of the Romans, who were taught to hate Monarchy, at first, by them that having deposed their Soveraign, shared amongst them the Soveraignty of _Rome_; and afterwards by their Successors. And by reading of these Greek, and Latine Authors, men from their childhood have gotten a habit (under a false shew of Liberty,) of favouring tumults, and of licentious controlling the actions of their Soveraigns; and again of controlling those controllers, with the effusion of so much blood; as I think I may truly say, there was never any thing so deerly bought, as these Western parts have bought the learning of the Greek and Latine tongues.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Liberty of Subjects how to be measured._# To come now to the particulars of the true Liberty of a Subject; that is to say, what are the things, which though commanded by the Soveraign, he may neverthelesse, without Injustice, refuse to do; we are to consider, what Rights we passe away, when we make a Common-wealth; or (which is all one,) what Liberty we deny our selves, by owning all the Actions (without exception) of the Man, or Assembly we make our Soveraign.

And there is allowance to be made for naturall timorousnesse, not onely to women, (of whom no such dangerous duty is expected,) but also to men of feminine courage.
