So that a _Person_, is the same that an _Actor_ is, both on the Stage and in common Conversation; and to _Personate_, is to _Act_, or _Represent_ himselfe, or an other; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his Person, or act in his name; (in which sence _Cicero_ useth it where he saies, _Unus sustineo tres Personas; Mei, Adversarii, & Judicis_, I beare three Persons; my own, my Adversaries, and the Judges;) and is called in diverse occasions, diversly; as a _Representer_, or _Representative_, a _Lieutenant_, a _Vicar_, an _Attorney_, a _Deputy_, a _Procurator_, an _Actor_, and the like.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of Persons Artificiall, some have their words and actions _Owned_ by those whom they represent. And then the Person is the _Actor_; and he that owneth his words#_Actor,_# and actions, is the ^Author^: In which case the Actor#_Actor,_# acteth by Authority. For that which in speaking of goods and possessions, is called an _Owner_, and in latine _Dominus_, in Greeke κύριος; speaking of Actions, is called Author. And as the Right of possession, is called Dominion; so the Right of doing any Action, is called#_Authority._# ^Authority^. So that by Authority, is alwayes understood a Right of doing any act: and _done by Authority_, done by Commission, or Licence from him whose right it is.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Covenants by Authority, bind the Author._# From hence it followeth, that when the Actor maketh a Covenant by Authority, he bindeth thereby the Author, no lesse than if he had made it himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to all the consequences of the same. And therfore all that hath been said formerly, (_Chap_. 14.) of the nature of Covenants between man and man in their naturall capacity, is true also when they are made by their Actors, Representers, or Procurators, that have authority from them, so far-forth as is in their Commission, but no farther.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor, or Representer, not knowing the Authority he hath, doth it at his own perill. For no man is obliged by a Covenant, whereof he is not Author; nor consequently by a Covenant made against, or beside the Authority he gave.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_But not the Actor._# When the Actor doth any thing against the Law of Nature by command of the Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey him, not he, but the Author breaketh the Law of Nature: for though the Action be against the Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but contrarily, to refuse to do it, is against the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth breach of Covenant.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The Authority is to be shewne._# And he that maketh a Covenant with the Author, by mediation of the Actor, not knowing what Authority he hath, but onely takes his word; in case such Authority be not made manifest unto him upon demand, is no longer obliged: For the Covenant made with the Author, is not valid, without his Counter-assurance. But if he that so Covenanteth, knew before hand he was to expect no other assurance, than the Actors word; then is the Covenant valid; because the Actor in this case maketh himselfe the Author. And therefore, as when the Authority is evident, the Covenant obligeth the Author, not the Actor; so when the Authority is feigned, it obligeth the Actor onely; there being no Author but himselfe.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are few things, that are uncapable of being##_Things personated, Inanimate._## represented by Fiction. Inanimate things, as a Church, an Hospital, a Bridge, may be personated by a Rector, Master, or Overseer. But things Inanimate, cannot be Authors, nor therefore give Authority to their Actors: Yet the Actors may have Authority to procure their maintenance, given them by those that are Owners, or Governours of those things.

Yet during the Folly, he that hath right of governing them, may give Authority to the Guardian. But this again has no place but in a State Civill, because before such estate, there is no Dominion of Persons.","subId":"10","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"An Idol, or meer Figment of the brain, may be Personated;#_False Gods;_# as were the Gods of the Heathen; which by such Officers as the State appointed, were Personated, and held Possessions, and other Goods, and Rights, which men from time to time dedicated, and consecrated unto them. But Idols cannot be Authors: for an Idol is nothing.

As he was; first,#_The true God._# by _Moses_; who governed the Israelites, (that were not his, but Gods people,) not in his own name, with _Hoc dicit Moses_; but in Gods Name, with _Hoc dicit Dominus_. Secondly, by the Son of man, his own Son, our Blessed Saviour _Jesus Christ_, that came to reduce the Jewes, and induce all Nations into the Kingdome of his Father; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his Father. And thirdly, by the Holy Ghost, or Comforter, speaking, and working in the Apostles: which Holy Ghost, was a Comforter that came not of himselfe; but was sent, and proceeded from them both.","subId":"12","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_A Multitude of men, how one Person._# A Multitude of men, are made _One_ Person, when they are by one man, or one Person, Represented; so that it be done with the consent of every one of that Multitude in particular.

For if the lesser number pronounce (for example) in the Affirmative, and the greater in the Negative, there will be Negatives more than enough to destroy the Affirmatives; and thereby the excesse of Negatives, standing uncontradicted, are the onely voyce the Representative hath.","subId":"15","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Representatives, when the number is even, unprofitable._# And a Representative of even number, especially when the number is not great, whereby the contradictory voyces are oftentimes equall, is therefore oftentimes mute, and uncapable of Action. Yet in some cases contradictory voyces equall in number, may determine a question; as in condemning, or absolving, equality of votes, even in that they condemne not, do absolve; but not on the contrary condemne, in that they absolve not. For when a Cause is heard; not to condemne, is to absolve: but on the contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is not true. The like it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring till another time: For when the voyces are equall, the not decreeing Execution, is a decree of Dilation.","subId":"16","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Or if the number be odde, as three, or more, (men,#_Negative voyce._# or assemblies;) whereof every one has by a Negative Voice, authority to take away the effect of all the Affirmative Voices of the rest, This number is no Representative; because by the diversity of Opinions, and Interests of men, it becomes oftentimes, and in cases of the greatest consequence, a mute Person, and unapt, as for many things else, so for the government of a Multitude, especially in time of Warre.","subId":"17","id":"Hobbes.L.1.16.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of Authors there be two sorts.
