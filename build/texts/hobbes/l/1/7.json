VII. £1 £1 _Of the _Ends_, or _Resolutions_ of ^Discourse^._ £1","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"^Of^ all _Discourse_, governed by desire of Knowledge, there is at last an _End_, either by attaining, or by giving over. And in the chain of Discourse, wheresoever it be interrupted, there is an End for that time.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the Discourse be meerly Mentall, it consisteth of thoughts that the thing will be, and will not be, or that it has been, and has not been, alternately. So that wheresoever you break off the chayn of a mans Discourse, you leave him in a Pr{ae}sumption of _it will be_, or, _it will not be_; or _it has been_, or, _has not been_. All which is _Opinion_. And that which is alternate Appetite, in Deliberating concerning Good and Evil; the same is alternate Opinion, in the Enquiry of the truth of _Past_, and _Future_. And as the last Appetite in Deliberation, is called the _Will_; so the last Opinion in search of the truth of Past, and Future, is called the ^Judgement^, or#_Judgement, or Sentence final._# _Resolute_ and _Finall Sentence_ of him that _discourseth_. And as the whole chain of Appetites alternate, in the question of Good, or Bad, is called _Deliberation_; so the whole chain of Opinions alternate, in the question of True, or False, is called ^Doubt^.#_Doubt._#","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"No Discourse whatsoever, can End in absolute knowledge of Fact, past, or to come. For, as for the knowledge of Fact, it is originally, Sense; and ever after, Memory. And for the knowledge of Consequence, which I have said before is called Science, it is not Absolute, but Conditionall. No man can know by Discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; which is to know absolutely: but onely, that if This be, That is; if This has been, That has been; if This shall be, That shall be: which is to know conditionally; and that not the consequence of one thing to another; but of one name of a thing, to another name of the same thing.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And therefore, when the Discourse is put into Speech, and begins with the Definitions of Words, and proceeds by Connexion of the same into generall Affirmations, and of these again into Syllogismes; the End or last summe is called the Conclusion; and the thought of the mind by it signified, is that conditionall Knowledge, or Knowledge of the consequence of words, which is#_Science._# commonly called ^Science^. But if the first ground of such Discourse, be not Definitions; or if the Definitions be not rightly joyned together into Syllogismes, then the#_Opinion._# End or Conclusion, is again ^Opinion^, namely of the truth of somewhat said, though sometimes in absurd and senslesse words, without possibility of being understood. When two, or more men, know of one and the#_Conscience._# same fact, they are said to be ^Conscious^ of it one to another; which is as much as to know it together. And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one another, or of a third; it was, and ever will be reputed a very Evill act, for any man to speak against his _Conscience_; or to corrupt or force another so to do: Insomuch that the plea of Conscience, has been alwayes hearkened unto very diligently in all times. Afterwards, men made use of the same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own secret facts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is Rhetorically said, that the Conscience is a thousand witnesses. And last of all, men, vehemently in love with their own new opinions, (though never so absurd,) and obstinately bent to maintain them, gave those their opinions also that reverenced name of Conscience, as if they would have it seem unlawfull, to change or speak against them; and so pretend to know they are true, when they know at most, but that they think so.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When a mans Discourse beginneth not at Definitions, it beginneth either at some other contemplation of his own, and then it is still called Opinion; Or it beginneth at some saying of another, of whose ability to know the truth, and of whose honesty in not deceiving, he doubteth not; and then the Discourse is not so much concerning the Thing, as the Person; And the Resolution is called ^Beleefe^, and ^Faith^: _Faith, in_ the man; _Beleefe_, both#_Beliefe. Faith._# _of_ the man, and _of_ the truth of what he sayes. So that in Beleefe are two opinions; one of the saying of the man; the other of his vertue. To _have faith in_, or _trust to_, or _beleeve a man_, signifie the same thing; namely, an opinion of the veracity of the man: But to _beleeve what is said_, signifieth onely an opinion of the truth of the saying. But wee are to observe that this Phrase, _I beleeve in_; as also the Latine, _Credo in_; and the Greek, πιστέυω are never used but in the writings of Divines. In stead of them, in other writings are put, _I beleeve him; I trust him: I have faith in him; I rely on him_; and in Latin, _Credo illi; fido illi_: and in Greek, πιστέυω ἀυτὠ: and that this singularity of the Ecclesiastique use of the word hath raised many disputes about the right object of the Christian Faith.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But by _Beleeving in_, as it is in the Creed, is meant, not trust in the Person; but Confession and acknowledgement of the Doctrine. For not onely Christians, but all manner of men do so believe in God, as to hold all for truth they heare him say, whether they understand it, or not; which is all the Faith and trust can possibly be had in any person whatsoever: But they do not all believe the Doctrine of the Creed.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From whence we may inferre, that when wee believe any saying whatsoever it be, to be true, from arguments taken, not from the thing it selfe, or from the principles of naturall Reason, but from the Authority, and good opinion wee have, of him that hath sayd it; then is the speaker, or person we believe in, or trust in, and whose word we take, the object of our Faith; and the Honour done in Believing, is done to him onely. And consequently, when wee Believe that the Scriptures are the word of God, having no immediate revelation from God himselfe, our Beleefe, Faith, and Trust is in the Church; whose word we take, and acquiesce therein. And they that believe that which a Prophet relates unto them in the name of God, take the word of the Prophet, do honour to him, and in him trust, and believe, touching the truth of what he relateth, whether he be a true, or a false Prophet. And so it is also with all other History. For if I should not believe all that is written by Historians, of the glorious acts of _Alexander_, or _C{ae}sar_; I do not think the Ghost of _Alexander_, or _C{ae}sar_, had any just cause to be offended; or any body else, but the Historian. If _Livy_ say the Gods made once a Cow speak, and we believe it not; wee distrust not God therein, but _Livy_. So that it is evident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other reason, then what is drawn from authority of men onely, and their writings; whether they be sent from God or not, is Faith in men onely.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.1.7.7"}]}
