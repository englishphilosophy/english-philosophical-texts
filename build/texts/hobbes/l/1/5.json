And though in some things, (as in numbers,) besides _Adding_ and _Substracting_, men name other operations, as _Multiplying_ and _Dividing_; yet they are the same; for Multiplication, is but Adding together of things equall; and Division, but Substracting of one thing, as often as we can. These operations are not incident to Numbers onely, but to all manner of things that can be added together, and taken one out of another. For as Arithmeticians teach to adde and substract in _numbers_; so the Geometricians teach the same in _lines, figures_ (solid and superficiall,) _angles, proportions, times_, degrees of _swiftnesse, force, power_, and the like; The Logicians teach the same in _Consequences of words_; adding together _two Names_, to make an _Affirmation_; and _two Affirmations_, to make a _Syllogisme_; and _many Syllogismes_ to make a _Demonstration_; and from the _summe_, or _Conclusion_ of a _Syllogisme_, they substract one _Proposition_, to finde the other. Writers of Politiques, adde together _Pactions_, to find mens _duties_; and Lawyers, _Lawes_, and _facts_, to find what is _right_ and _wrong_ in the actions of private men. In summe, in what matter soever there is place for _addition_ and _substraction_, there also is place for _Reason_; and where these have no place, there _Reason_ has nothing at all to do.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,#_Resaon defined._#) what that is, which is meant by this word _Reason_, when wee reckon it amongst the Faculties of the mind. For ^Reason^, in this sense, is nothing but _Reckoning_ (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the Consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the _marking_ and _signifying_ of our thoughts; I say _marking_ them, when we reckon by our selves; and _signifying_, when we demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other men.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And as in Arithmetique, unpractised men must, and#_Right reason where_# Professors themselves may often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other subject of Reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men, may deceive themselves, and inferre false Conclusions; Not but that Reason it selfe is alwayes Right Reason, as well as Arithmetique is a certain and infallible Art: But no one mans Reason, nor the Reason of any one number of men, makes the certaintie; no more than an account is therefore well cast up, because a great many men have unanimously approved it. And therefore, as when there is a controversy in an account, the parties must by their own accord, set up for right Reason, the Reason of some Arbitrator, or Judge, to whose sentence they will both stand, or their controversie must either come to blowes, or be undecided, for want of a right Reason constituted by Nature; so is it also in all debates of what kind soever: And when men that think themselves wiser than all others, clamor and demand right Reason for judge; yet seek no more, but that things should be determined, by no other mens reason but their own, it is as intolerable in the society of men, as it is in play after trump is turned, to use for trump on every occasion, that suite whereof they have most in their hand. For they do nothing els, that will have every of their passions, as it comes to bear sway in them, to be taken for right Reason, and that in their own controversies: bewraying their want of right Reason, by the claym they lay to it.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_The use of Reason._# The Use and End of Reason, is not the finding of the summe, and truth of one, or a few consequences, remote from the first definitions, and settled significations of names; but to begin at these; and proceed from one consequence to another. For there can be no certainty of the last Conclusion, without a certainty of all those Affirmations and Negations, on which it was grounded, and inferred. As when a master of a family, in taking an account, casteth up the summs of all the bills of expence, into one sum; and not regarding how each bill is summed up, by those that give them in account; nor what it is he payes for; he advantages himself no more, than if he allowed the account in grosse, trusting to every of the accountants skill and honesty: so also in Reasoning of all other things, he that takes up conclusions on the trust of Authors, and doth not fetch them from the first Items in every Reckoning, (which are the significations of names settled by definitions), loses his labour; and does not know any thing; but onely beleeveth.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"#_Of Error and Absurdity._# When a man reckons without the use of words, which may be done in particular things, (as when upon the sight of any one thing, wee conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow upon it;) if that which he thought likely to follow, followes not; or that which he thought likely to have preceded it, hath not preceded it, this is called ^Error^; to which even the most prudent men are subject. But when we Reason in Words of generall signification, and fall upon a generall inference which is false; though it be commonly called _Error_, it is indeed an ^Absurdity^, or senslesse Speech. For Error is but a deception, in presuming that somewhat is past, or to come; of which, though it were not past, or not to come; yet there was no impossibility discoverable. But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is unconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call _Absurd, Insignificant_, and _Non-sense_. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a _round Quadrangle_; or _accidents of Bread in Cheese_; or _Immateriall Substances_; or of _A free Subject_; _A free-Will_; or any _Free_, but free from being hindred by opposition, I should not say he were in an Errour; but that his words were without meaning; that is to say, Absurd.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have said before, (in the second chapter,) that a Man did excell all other Animals in this faculty, that when he conceived any thing whatsoever, he was apt to enquire the consequences of it, and what effects he could do with it. And now I adde this other degree of the same excellence, that he can by words reduce the consequences he findes to generall Rules, called _Theoremes_, or _Aphorismes_; that is, he can Reason, or reckon, not onely in number; but in all other things, whereof one may be added unto, or substracted from another.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But this priviledge, is allayed by another; and that is, by the priviledge of Absurdity; to which no living creature is subject, but man onely. And of men, those are of all most subject to it, that professe Philosophy. For it is most true that _Cicero_ sayth of them somewhere; that there can be nothing so absurd, but may be found in the books of Philosophers. And the reason is manifest. For there is not one of them that begins his ratiocination from the Definitions, or Explications of the names they are to use; which is a method that hath been used onely in Geometry; whose Conclusions have thereby been made indisputable.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The first cause of Absurd conclusions I ascribe to the#_Causes of absurditie I._# want of Method; in that they begin not their Ratiocination from Definitions; that is, from settled significations of their words: as if they could cast account, without knowing the value of the numerall words, _one, two_, and _three_.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And whereas all bodies enter into account upon divers considerations, (which I have mentioned in the precedent chapter;) these considerations being diversly named, divers absurdities proceed from the confusion, and unfit connexion of their names into assertions.

And whereas Sense and Memory are but knowledge of Fact, which is a thing past, and irrevocable; _Science_ is the knowledge of Consequences, and dependance of one fact upon another: by which, out of that we can presently do, we know how to do something else when we will, or the like, another time: Because when we see how any thing comes about, upon what causes, and by what manner; when the like causes come into our power, wee see how to make it produce the like effects.","subId":"17","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Children therefore are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained the use of Speech: but are called Reasonable Creatures, for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come.

For as for _Science_, or certain rules of their actions, they are so farre from it, that they know not what it is. Geometry they have thought Conjuring: But for other Sciences, they who have not been taught the beginnings, and some progresse in them, that they may see how they be acquired and generated, are in this point like children, that having no thought of generation, are made believe by the women, that their brothers and sisters are not born, but found in the garden.","subId":"18","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But yet they that have no _Science_, are in better, and nobler condition with their naturall Prudence; than men, that by mis-reasoning, or by trusting them that reason wrong, fall upon false and absurd generall rules.

For though wee usually have one name of Wisedome for them both; yet the Latines did alwayes distinguish between _Prudentia_ and _Sapientia_; ascribing the former to Experience, the later to Science. But to make their difference appeare more cleerly, let us suppose one man endued with an excellent naturall use, and dexterity in handling his armes; and another to have added to that dexterity, an acquired Science, of where he can offend, or be offended by his adversarie, in every possible posture, or guard: The ability of the former, would be to the ability of the later, as Prudence to Sapience; both usefull; but the later infallible.

Signes of prudence are all uncertain; because to observe by experience, and remember all circumstances that may alter the successe, is impossible. But in any businesse, whereof a man has not infallible Science to proceed by; to forsake his own naturall judgement, and be guided by generall sentences read in Authors, and subject to many exceptions, is a signe of folly, and generally scorned by the name of Pedantry. And even of those men themselves, that in Councells of the Common-wealth, love to shew their reading of Politiques and History, very few do it in their domestique affaires, where their particular interest is concerned; having Prudence enough for their private affaires: but in publique they study more the reputation of their owne wit, than the successe of anothers businesse.","subId":"22","id":"Hobbes.L.1.5.22"}]}
