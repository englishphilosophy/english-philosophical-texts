It was then translated from the Latin back into English, and published in 1692 in London. As the original manuscript sadly does not survive, we have no option but to take this third-hand 1692 version as our copytext. Our general principle on this site is to include only works originally published in the author’s own English, but the unusual history of this work seemed to merit making an exception.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A34395.0001.001/1:5.1?rgn=div2;view=fulltext","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£1 CHAP.

IN God is an _Idea,_ which is the Image of himself, or a Word existing within him; which in Substance or Essence is one and the same with him, by which he knows not only himself, but all other things, and according to which, yea by which _Idea_ or Word, all things were made and created.","subId":"6","id":"Conway.PAM.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\\S. 7. BY the like Reason in God is a Spirit or Will which proceeds from him, and yet as to Substance or Essence is something one with him, by which Creatures receive their Being and Activity: For Creatures have their Being and Existence simply and alone from him, because God would have them to be, whose Will is according to Knowledge most infinite. And thus Wisdom and Will in God, are not a certain Substance or Being distinct from him; but only distinct Manners or Properties of one and the same Substance; and seeing this is that which some of the Wisest and most Judicious Christians understand by the Word Trinity. If now we should neglect that; Phrase of Three distinct Persons, which is a Stone of Offence to _Jews_ as well as _Turks,_ and other People, and indeed in it self hath no sound Reason, nor can be any where found in Scripture; yet all would easily agree in this point: For they cannot deny that God hath Wisdom, and an Essential _Idea,_ and such a Word in himself by which he knows all things; and when they grant he giveth all Things their Being, they will be necessarily forced to acknowledge that there is a Will in him, by which he can accomplish and bring that into Act which was hid in the _Idea,_ that is, can produce it, and from thence make a distinct Essential Substance; and this alone is to create, _viz._ the Essence of a Creature: Nevertheless the _Idea_ alone doth not give being to the Creature; but the Will join'd with the _Idea,_ as when a Master-Builder conceives in his Mind the _Idea_ of an House, he doth not build that House by the _Idea_ alone, but the Will is joined with the _Idea,_ and co-operates therewith.","subId":"7","id":"Conway.PAM.1.7"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Conway","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":1692,"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","texts":[{"id":"Conway.PAM","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","title":"The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true}]},{"id":"Conway.PAM","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","title":"The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true}],"prev":{"id":"Conway.PAM","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","title":"The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true},"next":{"id":"Conway.PAM.Ann","imported":true,"title":"Annotations on Chapter 1","breadcrumb":"Annotations on Chapter 1","published":[1690]}}
