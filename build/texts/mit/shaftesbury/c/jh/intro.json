Accordingly we are to understand, that it is not merely the Shape or Dimension of a Cloth, or Board, which denominates the _Piece_ or _Tablature;_ since a Work of this kind may be compos'd of any colour'd Substance, as it may of any Form; whether square, oval or round. But 'tis then that in Painting we may give to any particular Work the Name of _Tablature,_ when the Work is in reality \"_a Single Piece,_ comprehended in one _View,_ and form'd according to _one single_ Intelligence, Meaning, or Design; which constitutes a _real_ ^Whole^, by a mutual and necessary Relation of its Parts, the same as of the Members in a natural Body.\" So that one may say of a Picture compos'd of any number of Figures differently rang'd, and without any regard to this Correspondency or Union describ'd, That it is no more a real _Piece_ or _Tablature,_ than a Picture wou'd be a Man's _Picture,_ or proper _Portraiture,_ which represented on the same Cloth, in different places, the Legs, Arms, Nose, and Eyes of such a Person, without adjusting them according to the true Proportion, Air, and Character which belong'd to him.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.Intro.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(3.) This Regulation has place even in the inferior degrees of Painting; since the mere Flower-Painter is, we see, oblig'd to study the Form of _Festons,_ and to make use of a peculiar Order, or Architecture of _Vases, Jars, Cannisters, Pedestals,_ and other Inventions, which serve as _Machines,_ to frame a certain proportionate Assemblage, or united Mass; according to the Rules of Perspective; and with regard as well to the different shapes and sizes of his several Flowers, as to the harmony of Colours resulting from the whole: this being the only thing capable of rendering his Work worthy the name of a _Composition_ or _real Piece._","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.Intro.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.) So much the more, therefore, is this Regulation applicable to _History-Painting,_ where not only _Men,_ but _Manners,_ and human Passions are represented. Here _the Unity of Design_ must with more particular exactness be preserv'd, according to the just Rules of poetick Art; that in the Representation of any Event, or remarkable Fact, the _Probability,_ or _seeming Truth,_ which is the _real Truth_ of Art, may with the highest advantage be supported and advanc'd: as we shall better understand in the Argument which follows on the historical _Tablature_ of _The Judgment of_ ^Hercules^; who being young, and retir'd to a solitary place in order to deliberate on the Choice he was to make of the different ways of Life, was accosted (as our Historian relates) by the two Goddesses, ^Virtue^ and ^Pleasure^. 'Tis on the issue of the Controversy between these _Two,_ that the Character of ^Hercules^ depends. So that we may naturally give to this Piece and History, as well the Title of _The Education,_ as _the Choice_ or _Judgment of_ ^Hercules^.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.Intro.4"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Shaftesbury","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Lord Shaftesbury","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":1699,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Characteristicks"},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LMU","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Several Letters Written by a Noble Lord to a Young Man at the University","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1716],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Letters to a Man at the University"},{"id":"Shaftesbury.LM","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"The Late Earl of Shaftesbury's Letters to the Right Honourable the Lord Molesworth","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1721],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Letters to Molesworth"}]},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Ashley Cooper","title":"Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times","birth":1671,"death":1713,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Characteristicks"},{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH","imported":true,"title":"A Notion of the Historical Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules","breadcrumb":"Judgment of Hercules","published":[1714]}],"prev":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH","imported":true,"title":"A Notion of the Historical Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules","breadcrumb":"Judgment of Hercules","published":[1714]},"next":{"id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.1","imported":true,"title":"Chapter I.
