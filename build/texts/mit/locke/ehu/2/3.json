The copytext for this version is the 4th edition of 1700, which is the last edition to be printed in Locke’s lifetime, and contains several changes and additions. The text is derived from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP. Several changes are being made to this source, to bring the text in line with the 1700 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A48874.0001.001/1:7.3?rgn=div2;view=fulltext","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"£1 CHAP. III. £1 £2 _Of _Ideas_ of one Sense._ £2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THE better to conceive the _Ideas,_ we receive from Sensation, it may not be amiss for us to consider them, in reference to the different ways, whereby they make their Approaches to our Minds, and make themselves perceivable by us. _First_ then, There are some, which come into our Minds _by one Sense_ only. _Secondly,_ There are others, that convey themselves into the Mind _by more Senses than one._ _Thirdly,_ Others that are had from _Reflection_ only. _Fourthly,_ There are some that make themselves way, and are suggested to the Mind _by all the ways of Sensation and Reflection._ We shall consider them apart under these several Heads: _First,_ There are _some_ Ideas, _which have admittance only through one Sense,_ which is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus Light and Colours, as white, red, yellow, blue; with their several Degrees or Shades, and Mixtures, as Green, Scarlet, Purple, Sea-green, and the rest, come in only by the Eyes: All kinds of Noises, Sounds, and Tones only by the Ears: The several Tastes and Smells, by the Nose and Palate. And if these Organs, or the Nerves which are the Conduits, to convey them from without to their Audience in the Brain, the Mind's Presence-Room (as I may so call it) are any of them so disordered, as not to perform their Functions, they have no Postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the Understanding. The most considerable of those, belonging to the Touch, are Heat and Cold, and Solidity; all the rest, consisting almost wholly in the sensible Configuration, as smooth and rough; or else more, or less firm adhesion of the Parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious enough.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I think, it will be needless to enumerate all the particular _simple Ideas,_ belonging to each Sense: Nor indeed is it possible, if we would, there being a great many _more_ of them belonging to most of the Senses, _than we have Names for._ The variety of Smells, which are as many almost, if not more than Species of Bodies in the World, do most of them want Names. _Sweet_ and _Stinking_ commonly serve our turn for these _Ideas,_ which in effect, is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing; though the smell of a Rose, and Violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct _Ideas._ Nor are the different Tastes that are in Nature, much better provided with Names. Sweet, Bitter and Sowre, Harsh and Salt, are almost all we have to denominate all the variety of Relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of Creatures, but in the different Parts of the same Plant or Animal. The same may be said of Colour and Sound. I shall therefore in the account of simple _Ideas,_ I am here giving, content my self to set down only such, as are most material to our present Purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the Ingredients of our complex _Ideas,_ amongst which, I think, I may well account Solidity; which therefore I shall treat of in the next Chapter.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.3.2"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Locke","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":1689,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Locke.LT1","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"First Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"First Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TG","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Two Treatises of Government","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Two Treatises of Government"},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.LT2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.LT3","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1692],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TCE","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Some Thoughts Concerning Education","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1693],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Thoughts Concerning Education"},{"id":"Locke.RC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VRC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity from Mr. Edwards's Reflections","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VC2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Second Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1697],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Vindication of Christianity"}]},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.EHU.2","imported":true,"title":"Book 2.
