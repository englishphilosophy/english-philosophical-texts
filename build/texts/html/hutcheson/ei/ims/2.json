That upon comparing two <em>Ideas</em> there arises a <em>relative Idea,</em> generally when the two Ideas compared have in them any <em>Modes of the same simple Idea,</em> is also obvious. Thus every <em>extended Being</em> may be compared to any other of the same <em>Kinds of Dimensions;</em> and <em>relative Ideas</em> be formed of <em>greater, less, equal, double, triple, subduple,</em> &amp;c. with infinite variety. This may let us see that Relations are not <em>real Qualities</em> inherent in external Natures, but only <em>Ideas</em> necessarily accompanying our <em>Perception</em> of two Objects at once, and comparing them. <em>Relative Ideas</em> do continue, when the external Objects do not exist, provided we retain the <em>two Ideas.</em> But what the <em>eternal Relations</em> in the Natures of Things do mean, is not so easy perhaps to be conceived.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Three sorts of Relationsconsidered.</span>To shew particularly how far <em>Morality</em> can be concerned in <em>Relations,</em> we may consider them under these Three Classes. 1.

The <em>Relations of inanimate Objects to rational Agents, as to their active or passive Powers.</em> 3.

Now let us examine what <em>Fitnesses</em> or <em>Unfitnesses</em> arise from any of these <em>sorts of Relations,</em> in which the <em>Morality</em> of Actions may consist; and whether we can place <em>Morality</em> in them, without presupposing a <em>moral Sense.</em> 'Tis plain, that ingenious Author says nothing against the Supposition of a <em>moral Sense:</em> But many do imagine, that his Account of moral Ideas is independent upon a moral Sense, and therefore are less willing to allow that we have such an immediate Perception, or Sense of Virtue and Vice. What follows is not intended to oppose his Scheme, but rather to suggest what seems a necessary Explication of it; by shewing that it is no otherwise intelligible, but upon Supposition of a <em>moral Sense.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">None of them explain Morality without a Sense.</span> Relations <em>of inanimate Objects</em> being known, puts it in the Power of a rational Agent often to <em>diversify</em> them, to <em>change their Forms, Motions,</em> or <em>Qualities</em> of any kind, at his pleasure: but no body apprehends any <em>Virtue</em> or <em>Vice</em> in such Actions, where no <em>Relation</em> is apprehended to a <em>rational Agent's Happiness</em> or <em>Misery;</em> otherwise we should have got into the Class of Virtues all the practical <em>Mathematicks,</em> and the Operations of <em>Chymistry.</em>","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the <em>Relations of inanimate Objects to rational Agents;</em> the Knowledge of them equally puts it in one's Power to <em>destroy Mankind,</em> as to preserve them.
