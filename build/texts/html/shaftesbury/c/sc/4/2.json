Let the <em>solemn</em> Reprovers of Vice proceed in the manner most sutable to their Genius and Character. I am ready to congratulate with 'em on the Success of their Labours, in that authoritative way which is allow'd 'em. I know not, in the mean while, why others may not be allow'd to <em>ridicule</em> Folly, and recommend Wisdom and Virtue (if possibly they can) in a way of Pleasantry and Mirth. I know not why Poets, or such as write chiefly for the Entertainment of themselves and others, may not be allow'd this Privilege. And if it be the Complaint of our <em>standing Reformers,</em> that they are not heard so well by <em>the Gentlemen of Fashion;</em> if they exclaim against those airy Wits who fly to <em>Ridicule</em> as a Protection, and make successful Sallys from that Quarter; why shou'd it be deny'd one, who is only <em>a Volunteer</em> in this Cause, to engage the Adversary on his own terms, and expose himself willingly to such Attacks, on the single condition of being allow'd <em>fair Play</em> in the same kind?","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By <em>Gentlemen of Fashion,</em> I understand those to whom a natural good Genius, or the Force of good Education, has given a <em>Sense</em> of what is <em>naturally graceful</em> and <em>becoming.</em> Some by mere Nature, others by Art and Practice, are Masters of an Ear in Musick, an Eye in Painting, a Fancy in the ordinary things of Ornament and Grace, a Judgment in Proportions of all kinds, and a general good Taste in most of those Subjects which make the Amusement and Delight of the ingenious People of the World. Let such Gentlemen as these be as extravagant as they please, or as irregular in their Morals; they must at the same time discover their Inconsistency, live at variance with themselves, and in contradiction to that Principle, on which they ground their highest Pleasure and Entertainment.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of all other Beautys which <em>Virtuosos</em> pursue, <em>Poets</em> celebrate, <em>Musicians</em> sing, and <em>Architects</em> or <em>Artists,</em> of whatever kind, describe or form; the most delightful, the most engaging and pathetick, is that which is drawn from real <em>Life,</em> and from the <em>Passions.</em> Nothing affects the Heart like that which is purely <em>from it-self,</em> and <em>of its own nature;</em> such as <em>the Beauty of Sentiments,</em> <em>the Grace of Actions, the Turn of Characters,</em> and <em>the Proportions and Features of a human Mind.</em> This Lesson of Philosophy, even a Romance, a Poem, or a Play may teach us; whilst the fabulous Author leads us with such pleasure thro' the Labyrinth of the Affections, and interests us, whether we will or no, in the Passions of his Heroes and Heroines:","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>Like a Mage, he tortures, enrages, soothes, fills us with false terrors.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let Poets, or the Men of Harmony, deny, if they can, this Force of <em>Nature,</em> or withstand this <em>moral Magick.</em> They, for their parts, carry a double portion of this Charm about 'em.

And in the next place, 'tis evident in these Performers, that their chief Theme and Subject, that which raises their Genius the most, and by which they so effectually move others, is purely <em>Manners,</em> and the <em>moral Part.</em> For this is the Effect, and this the Beauty of their Art; <q>in vocal Measures of Syllables, and Sounds, to express the Harmony and Numbers of an inward kind; and represent the Beautys of a human Soul, by proper Foils, and Contrarietys, which serve as Graces in this Limning, and render this Musick of the Passions more powerful and enchanting.</q>","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Admirers of Beauty in the Fair Sex wou'd laugh, perhaps, to hear of a <em>moral Part</em> in their Amours.

Let them settle this matter among themselves; and regulate, as they think fit, the Proportions which these different Beautys hold one to another: They must allow still, there is a Beauty of <em>the Mind;</em> and such as is essential in the Case. Why else is the very <em>Air of Foolishness</em> enough to cloy a Lover, at first sight? Why does an <em>Idiot-Look</em> and <em>Manner</em> destroy the Effect of all those outward Charms, and rob the <em>Fair-One</em> of her Power; tho regularly arm'd, in all the Exactness of Features and Complexion? We may imagine what we please of a substantial solid part of Beauty: but were the Subject to be well criticiz'd, we shou'd find, perhaps, that what we most admir'd, even in the turn of <em>outward</em> Features, was only a mysterious Expression, and a kind of Shadow of something <em>inward</em> in the Temper: and that when we were struck with a <em>majestick</em> Air, a <em>sprightly</em> Look, an <em>Amazon bold</em> Grace, or a contrary <em>soft</em> and <em>gentle</em> one; 'twas chiefly the Fancy of these Characters or Qualitys which wrought on us: our Imagination being busy'd in forming beauteous Shapes and Images of this rational kind, which entertain'd the Mind, and held it in admiration; whilst other Passions of a lower Species were employ'd another way. The preliminary Addresses, the Declarations, the Explanations, Confidences, Clearings; the Dependence on something mutual, something felt by way of return; the <em>Spes animi credula mutui:</em> all these become necessary Ingredients in the Affair of Love, and are authentically establish'd by the Men of Elegance and Art in this way of Passion.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor can the Men of cooler Passions, and more deliberate Pursuits, withstand the Force of <em>Beauty,</em> in other Subjects.

The Models of Houses, Buildings, and their accompanying Ornaments; the Plans of Gardens, and their Compartments; the ordering of Walks, Plantations, Avenues; and a thousand other Symmetrys, will succeed in the room of that happier and higher Symmetry and Order of a Mind.
