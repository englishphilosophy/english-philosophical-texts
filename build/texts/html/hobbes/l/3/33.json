And because all Rules of life, which men are in conscience bound to observe, are Laws; the question of the Scripture, is the question of what is Law throughout all Christendome, both Naturall, and Civill. For though it be not determined in Scripture, what Laws every Christian King shall constitute in his own Dominions; yet it is determined what laws he shall not constitute. Seeing therefore I have already proved, that Soveraigns in their own Dominions are the sole Legislators; those Books only are Canonicall, that is, Law, in every nation, which are established for such by the Soveraign Authority. It is true, that God is the Soveraign of all Soveraigns; and therefore, when he speaks to any Subject, he ought to be obeyed, whatsoever any earthly Potentate command to the contrary. But the question is not of obedience to God, but of <em>when</em>, and <em>what</em> God hath said; which to Subjects that have no supernaturall revelation, cannot be known, but by that naturall reason, which guided them, for the obtaining of Peace and Justice, to obey the authority of their severall Common-wealths; that is to say, of their lawfull Soveraigns. According to this obligation, I can acknowledge no other Books of the Old Testament, to be Holy Scripture, but those which have been commanded to be acknowledged for such, by the Authority of the Church of <em>England</em>. What Books these are, is sufficiently known, without a Catalogue of them here; and they are the same that are acknowledged by St. <em>Jerome</em>, who holdeth the rest, namely, the <em>Wisdome of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias</em>, the first and the second of <em>Maccabees</em>, (though he had seen the first in <em>Hebrew</em>) and the third and fourth of <em>Esdras</em>, for <em>Apocrypha</em>. Of the Canonicall, <em>Josephus</em> a learned <em>Jew</em>, that wrote in the time of the Emperour <em>Domitian</em>, reckoneth <em>twenty two</em>, making the number agree with the <em>Hebrew</em> Alphabet. St. <em>Jerome</em> does the same, though they reckon them in different manner. For <em>Josephus</em> numbers <em>five</em> Books of <em>Moses, thirteen</em> of <em>Prophets</em>, that writ the History of their own times (which how it agrees with the Prophets writings contained in the Bible wee shall see hereafter), and <em>four</em> of <em>Hymnes</em> and Morall Precepts. But St. <em>Jerome</em> reckons <em>five</em> Books of <em>Moses, eight</em> of <em>Prophets</em>, and <em>nine</em> of other Holy writ, which he calls of <em>Hagiographa</em>. The <em>Septuagint</em>, who were 70. learned men of the <em>Jews</em>, sent for by <em>Ptolemy</em> King of <em>Egypt</em>, to translate the <em>Jewish</em> law, out of the <em>Hebrew</em> into the <em>Greek</em>, have left us no other for holy Scripture in the <em>Greek</em> tongue, but the same that are received in the Church of <em>England</em>.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.3.33.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for the Books of the New Testament, they are equally acknowledged for Canon by all Christian Churches, and by all Sects of Christians, that admit any Books at all for Canonicall.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.3.33.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Their Antiquity.</em></span> Who were the originall writers of the severall Books of Holy Scripture, has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History, (which is the only proof of matter of fact); nor can be by any arguments of naturall Reason: for Reason serves only to convince the truth (not of fact, but) of consequence.

And if the Books of <em>Apocrypha</em> (which are recommended to us by the Church, though not for Canonicall, yet for profitable Books for our instruction) may in this point be credited, the Scripture was set forth in the form wee have it in, by <em>Esdras</em>; as may appear by that which he himself saith, in the second book, chapt. 14. verse 21, 22, &amp;c. where speaking to God, he saith thus, <em>Thy law is burnt; therefore no man knoweth the things which thou hast done, or the works that are to begin.

And thus much concerning the time of the writing of the Bookes of the Old Testament.","subId":"19","id":"Hobbes.L.3.33.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Writers of the New Testament lived all in lesse<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>The New Testament.</em></span> then an age after Christs Ascension, and had all of them seen our Saviour, or been his Disciples, except St. <em>Paul</em>, and St. <em>Luke</em>; and consequently whatsoever was written by them, is as ancient as the time of the Apostles. But the time wherein the Books of the New Testament were received, and acknowledged by the Church to be of their writing, is not altogether so ancient. For, as the Bookes of the Old Testament are derived to us, from no higher time then that of <em>Esdras</em>, who by the direction of Gods Spirit retrived them, when they were lost: Those of the New Testament, of which the copies were not many, nor could easily be all in any one private mans hand, cannot bee derived from a higher time, than that wherein the Governours of the Church collected, approved, and recommended them to us, as the writings of those Apostles and Disciples; under whose names they go. The first enumeration of all the Bookes, both of the Old, and New Testament, is in the Canons of the Apostles, supposed to be collected by <em>Clement</em> the first (after St. <em>Peter</em>) Bishop of <em>Rome</em>. But because that is but supposed, and by many questioned, the Councell of <em>Laodicea</em> is the first we know, that recommended the Bible to the then Christian Churches, for the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles: and this Councell was held in the 364. yeer after Christ. At which time, though ambition had so far prevailed on the great Doctors of the Church, as no more to esteem Emperours, though Christian, for the Shepherds of the people, but for Sheep; and Emperours not Christian, for Wolves; and endeavoured to passe their Doctrine, not for Counsell, and Information, as Preachers; but for Laws, as absolute Governours; and thought such frauds as tended to make the people the more obedient to Christian Doctrine, to be pious; yet I am perswaded they did not therefore falsifie the Scriptures, though the copies of the Books of the New Testament, were in the hands only of the Ecclesiasticks; because if they had had an intention so to doe, they would surely have made them more favorable to their power over Christian Princes, and Civill Soveraignty, than they are. I see not therefore any reason to doubt, but that the Old, and New Testament, as we have them now, are the true Registers of those things, which were done and said by the Prophets, and Apostles. And so perhaps are some of those Books which are called Apocrypha, if left out of the Canon, not for inconformity of Doctrine with the rest, but only because they are not found in the Hebrew. For after the conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great, there were few learned Jews, that were not perfect in the Greek tongue. For the seventy Interpreters that converted the Bible into Greek, were all of them Hebrews; and we have extant the works of <em>Philo</em> and <em>Josephus</em> both Jews, written by them eloquently in Greek. But it is not the Writer, but the authority of the Church, that maketh a Book Canonicall. And although these Books were<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Their Scope.</em></span> written by divers men, yet it is manifest the Writers were all indued with one and the same Spirit, in that they conspire to one and the same end, which is the setting forth of the Rights of the Kingdome of <em>God</em>, the <em>Father, Son</em>, and <em>Holy Ghost</em>. For the Book of <em>Genesis</em>, deriveth the Genealogy of Gods people, from the creation of the World, to the going into Egypt: the other four Books of <em>Moses</em>, contain the Election of God for their King, and the Laws which hee prescribed for their Government: The Books of <em>Joshua, Judges, Ruth</em>, and <em>Samuel</em>, to the time of <em>Saul</em>, describe the acts of Gods people, till the time they cast off Gods yoke, and called for a King, after the manner of their neighbour nations: The rest of the History of the Old Testament, derives the succession of the line of <em>David</em>, to the Captivity, out of which line was to spring the restorer of the Kingdome of God, even our blessed Saviour <em>God the Son</em>, whose coming was foretold in the Bookes of the Prophets, after whom the Evangelists writt his life, and actions, and his claim to the Kingdome, whilst he lived on earth: and lastly, the Acts, and Epistles of the Apostles, declare the coming of God, the <em>Holy Ghost</em>, and the Authority he left with them, and their successors, for the direction of the Jews, and for the invitation of the Gentiles. In summe, the Histories and the Prophecies of the old Testament, and the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament, have had one and the same scope, to convert men to the obedience of God; 1. in <em>Moses</em>, and the Priests; 2. in the man <em>Christ</em>; and 3. in the <em>Apostles</em> and the successors to Apostolicall power. For these three at several times did represent the person of God: <em>Moses</em>, and his successors the High Priests, and Kings of Judah, in the Old Testament:<em>Christ</em> himself, in the time he lived on earth: and the <em>Apostles</em>, and their successors, from the day of Pentecost (when the <em>Holy Ghost</em> descended on them) to this day.","subId":"20","id":"Hobbes.L.3.33.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>The question of the Authority of the Scriptures stated.</em></span> It is a question much disputed between the divers sects of Christian Religion, <em>From whence the Scriptures derive their Authority</em>; which question is also propounded sometimes in other terms, as, <em>How wee know them to be the Word of God</em>, or, <em>Why we beleeve them to be so</em>: And the difficulty of resolving it, ariseth chiefly from the impropernesse of the words wherein the question it self is couched.

Again, if it be not the Legislative Authority of the Common-wealth, that giveth them the force of Laws, it must bee some other Authority derived from God, either private, or publique: if private, it obliges onely him, to whom in particular God hath been pleased to reveale it. For if every man should be obliged, to take for Gods Law, what particular men, on pretence of private Inspiration, or Revelation, should obtrude upon him, (in such a number of men, that out of pride, and ignorance, take their own Dreams, and extravagant Fancies, and Madnesse, for testimonies of Gods Spirit; or out of ambition, pretend to such Divine testimonies, falsely, and contrary to their own consciences,) it were impossible that any Divine Law should be acknowledged. If publique, it is the Authority of the <em>Common-wealth</em>, or of the <em>Church</em>. But the Church, if it be one person, is the same thing with a Common-wealth of Christians; called a <em>Common-wealth</em>, because it consisteth of men united in one person, their Soveraign; and a <em>Church</em>, because it consisteth in Christian men, united in one Christian Soveraign. But if the Church be not one person, then it hath no authority at all; it can neither command, nor doe any action at all; nor is capable of having any power, or right to any thing; nor has any Will, Reason, nor Voice; for all these qualities are personall.

So that the question of the Authority of the Scriptures, is reduced to this, <em>Whether Christian Kings, and the Soveraigne Assemblies in Christian Common-wealths, be absolute in their own Territories, immediately under God; or subject to one Vicar of Christ, constituted over the Universall Church; to bee judged, condemned, deposed, and put to death, as hee shall think expedient, or necessary for the common good</em>.","subId":"24","id":"Hobbes.L.3.33.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Which question cannot bee resolved, without a more particular consideration of the Kingdome of God; from whence also, wee are to judge of the Authority of Interpreting the Scripture.
