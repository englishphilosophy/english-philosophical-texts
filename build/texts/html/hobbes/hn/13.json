Of these Signs, <em>some</em> are such as <em>cannot</em> easily be <em>counterfeited</em>; as Actions and Gestures, especially if they be sudden, whereof I have mentioned some; (for Example, look in Chap. 9.) with the several Passions whereof they are Signs: <em>Others</em> there are which <em>may</em> be <em>counterfeited</em>; and those are <em>Words</em> or <em>Speech</em>; of the Use and Effects whereof, I am to speak in this Place.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.13.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The first Use of Language, is the <em>expression</em> of our <em>Conceptions,</em> that is, the begetting in one another the same Conceptions that we have in our selves; and this is called <em>Teaching</em>; wherein, if the <em>Conception</em> of him that teacheth continually accompany his Words, <em>beginning</em> at something true in <em>Experience,</em> then it begetteth the like Evidence in the Hearer that understandeth them, and maketh him to <em>know</em> something, which he is therefore said to <em>learn</em>: but if there be <em>not such Evidence,</em> then such teaching is called <em>Perswasion,</em> and begetteth no more in the Hearer, than what is in the Speakers bare <em>Opinion.</em> And the <em>Signs</em> of two Opinions contradictory one to another; namely, <em>Affirmation</em> and <em>Negation</em> of the same Thing, is called <em>Controversie</em>: but <em>both Affirmations,</em> or <em>both Negations, Consent in Opinion.</em>","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.13.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <em>infallible</em> Sign of <em>teaching exactly,</em> and without errour, is this, that <em>no Man</em> hath <em>ever taught</em> the <em>Contrary:</em> Not that few, how few soever, if any; for commonly Truth is on the side of a few, rather than of the Multitude: But when in Opinions and Questions considered and discussed by many, it happeneth that not any one of the Men that so discuss'd them differ from another, then it may be justly inferred, they know what they teach, and that otherwise they do not. And this appears most manifestly to them that have considered the divers Subjects wherein they have exercised their Pens, and the divers Ways in which they have proceeded, together with the Diversity of the Success thereof: for, those Men who have taken in hand to consider nothing else but the Comparison of <em>Magnitudes, Numbers, Times,</em> and <em>Motions,</em> and how their Proportions are to one another, have thereby been the Authors of all those Excellencies by which we differ from such savage People as now inhabit divers places in <em>America</em>; and as have been the Inhabitants heretofore of those Countries where at this day Arts and Sciences do most flourish: for, from the Studies of these Men, have proceeded whatsoever cometh to us for Ornament by <em>Navigation,</em> and whatsoever we have beneficial to humane Society by the <em>Division, Distinction,</em> and <em>Portraicting the Face of the Earth</em>; whatsoever also we have by the <em>Account of Times,</em> and <em>Foresight of the Course of Heaven</em>; whatsoever by <em>Measuring Distances, Plains,</em> and <em>Solids</em> of all Sorts; and whatsoever either <em>elegant</em> or <em>defensible</em> in <em>Building</em>: All which supposed a Way, what do we differ from the wildest of the <em>Indians</em>? Yet to this day was it never heard of, that there was any <em>Controversie</em> concerning any Conclusion in this Subject; the Science whereof hath nevertheless been continually amplified and enriched by the Conclusions of most difficult and profound Speculation. The <em>Reason</em> whereof is apparent to every Man that looketh into their Writings; for they proceed from most <em>low</em> and <em>humble</em> Principles, evident even to the meanest Capacity; going on <em>slowly,</em> and with most <em>scrupulous Ratiocination</em>; viz. from the Imposition of Names, they inferr the Truth of their <em>first</em> Propositions; and from two of the first, a <em>third</em>; and from any two of the three, a <em>fourth</em>; and so on, according to the Steps of Science, mentioned Chap. 6. Sect. 4. On the other side, those Men who have written concerning the Faculties, Passions, and Manners of Men, that is to say; of <em>Moral Philosophy,</em> and of <em>Policy, Government,</em> and <em>Laws,</em> whereof there be infinite Volumes, have been so <em>far from removing Doubt</em> and Controversie in the Questions they have handled, <em>that</em> they have very much <em>multiplied the same: Nor</em> doth any Man at this day so much as pretend to <em>know</em> more than hath been delivered Two thousand Years ago by <em>Aristotle</em>: and yet every Man thinks that in this Subject he knoweth as much as any other; supposing there needeth thereunto no Study but that accrueth unto them by natural Wit; though they play, or imploy their Mind otherwise in the Purchace of Wealth or Place. The Reason whereof is no other, than that in their Writings and Discourses they take for Principles those Opnions which are already vulgarly received; whether true or false, being for the most part false. There is therefore a great deal of <em>Difference</em> between <em>Teaching</em> and <em>Perswading</em>; the Sign of <em>this</em> being <em>Controversie</em>; the Sign of the <em>former, no Controversie.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.13.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There be <em>two Sorts</em> of Men that commonly be called <em>learned</em>: One is that Sort that proceedeth <em>evidently</em> from humble Principles, as is described in the last Section; and those Men are called <em>Mathematici: The other</em> are they that <em>take up</em> Maxims from their <em>Education,</em> and from the <em>Authority</em> of Men, or of Custom, and <em>take the habitual Discourse of the Tongue for Ratiocination</em>; and these are called <em>Dogmatici.</em> Now seeing in the last Section those we call <em>Mathematici</em> are absolved of the Crime of breeding Controversie, and they that pretend not to Learning cannot be accused, the Fault lieth altogether in the <em>Dogmaticks,</em> that is to say, those that are imperfectly learned, and with Passion press to have their Opinions pass every where for Truth, without any evident Demonstration either from Experience, or from Places of Scripture of uncontroverted Interpretation.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.13.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Expression of those Conceptions which <em>cause</em> in us the <em>Experience</em> of Good while we deliberate, as also of those which cause our Expectation of Evil, is that which we call <em>Counselling,</em> and is the internal Deliberation of the Mind concerning what we our selves are to do or not to do.
