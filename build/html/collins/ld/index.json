A series of public letters between Clarke and Collins followed over the next few years, furthering the debate. They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","blocks":[],"texts":[{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.1","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Letter to Dodwell","published":[1706]},{"id":"Collins.LD.2","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Collins's Letter to Dodwell","published":[1706]},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.3","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's First Defence","published":[1707]},{"id":"Collins.LD.4","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Reply to Mr Clark's Defence of his Letter to Mr. Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Collins's First Reply","published":[1707]},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.5","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Second Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Second Defence","published":[1707]},{"id":"Collins.LD.6","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"Reflections on Mr. Clark's Second Defence of his Letter to Mr. Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Collins's Second Reply","published":[1707]},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.7","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Third Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Third Defence","published":[1708]},{"id":"Collins.LD.8","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"An Answer to Mr. Clark's Third Defence of his Letter to Mr. Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Collins's Third Reply","published":[1708]},{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.9","imported":false,"duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Fourth Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Fourth Defence","published":[1708]}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Collins","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":1707,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Collins.LD","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","breadcrumb":"Letters to Mr Dodwell"},{"id":"Collins.EUR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"An Essay concerning the Use of Reason","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1707],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Essay concerning the Use of Reason"},{"id":"Collins.DFT","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Discourse of Free-Thinking"},{"id":"Collins.FDF","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Farther Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Farther Discourse of Free-Thinking"},{"id":"Collins.IHL","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Philosophical Inquiry concerning Human Liberty","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1717],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Inquiry concerning Human Liberty"},{"id":"Collins.DCR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse on the Grounds and Reason of the Christian Religion","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1724],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Discourse on Christian Religion"},{"id":"Collins.DLN","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Dissertation on Libery and Necessity","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1729],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Dissertation on Libery and Necessity"}]}],"next":{"id":"Collins.EUR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"An Essay concerning the Use of Reason","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1707],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Essay concerning the Use of Reason"}}
