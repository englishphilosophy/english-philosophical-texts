For Example, when I perceive a great Number of intermediate Objects, such as Houses, Fields, Rivers, and the like, which I have experienced to take up a considerable Space, I thence form a Judgment or Conclusion, that the Object I see beyond them is at a great Distance. Again, when an Object appears faint and small, which at a near Distance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large Appearance, I instantly conclude it to be far off: And this, 'tis evident is the result of Experience; without which, from the Faintness and Littleness I should not have inferred any thing concerning the Distance of Objects.","subId":"3","id":"Berkeley.ETV.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But when an Object is placed at so near a Distance, as that the Interval between the Eyes bears any sensible Proportion to it, the Opinion of speculative Men is, that the two Optic Axes (the Fancy that we see only with one Eye at once being exploded) concurring at the Object do there make an Angle, by means of which, according as it is greater or lesser, the Object is perceived to be nearer or farther off.<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>","subId":"4","id":"Berkeley.ETV.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Betwixt which, and the foregoing Manner of estimating Distance, there is this remarkable Difference: That, whereas there was no apparent, necessary Connexion between small Distance and a large and strong Appearance, or between great Distance and a little and faint Appearance, there appears a very necessary Connexion between an obtuse Angle and near Distance, and an acute Angle and farther Distance. It does not in the least depend upon Experience, but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienced it, that the nearer the Concurrence of the Optic Axes, the greater the Angle, and the remoter their Concurrence is, the lesser will be the Angle comprehended by them.","subId":"5","id":"Berkeley.ETV.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is another way mentioned by Optic Writers, whereby they will have us judge of those Distances, in respect of which the Breadth of the Pupil hath any sensible Bigness: And that is the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays, which issuing from the visible Point, do fall on the Pupil: That Point being judged nearest, which is seen by most diverging Rays: and that remoter which is seen by less diverging Rays: And so on, the apparent Distance still increasing, as the Divergency of the Rays decreases, till at length it becomes infinite, when the Rays that fall on the Pupil are to Sense Parallel.

Or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays, which arrive from any Point to his Pupil? Every one is himself the best Judge of what he perceives, and what not.

And <em>First</em>, It is certain by Experience, that when we look at a near Object with both Eyes, according as it approaches, or recedes from us, we alter the Disposition of our Eyes, by lessening or widening the Interval between the Pupils. This Disposition or Turn of the Eyes is attended with a Sensation, which seems to me to be that which in this Case brings the Idea of greater or lesser Distance into the Mind.","subId":"16","id":"Berkeley.ETV.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not that there is any natural or necessary Connexion between the Sensation we perceive by the Turn of the Eyes, and greater or lesser Distance: but because the Mind has by constant Experience found the different Sensations corresponding to the different Dispositions of the Eyes, to be attended each with a different Degree of Distance in the Object; There has grown an Habitual or Customary Connexion between those two sorts of Ideas, so that the Mind no sooner perceives the Sensation arising from the different Turn it gives the Eyes, in order to bring the Pupils nearer, or farther asunder, but it withal perceives the different Idea of Distance which was wont to be connected with that Sensation: Just as upon hearing a certain Sound, the Idea is immediately suggested to the Understanding, which Custom had united with it.","subId":"17","id":"Berkeley.ETV.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor do I see, how I can easily be mistaken in this Matter. I know evidently that Distance is not perceived of it self. That by Consequence, it must be perceived by means of some other Idea which is immediately perceived, and varies with the different Degrees of Distance. I know also that the Sensation arising from the Turn of the Eyes is of it self immediately perceived, and various Degrees thereof are connected with different Distances, which never fail to accompany them into my Mind, when I view an Object distinctly with both Eyes, whose Distance is so small that in respect of it the Interval between the Eyes has any considerable Magnitude.","subId":"18","id":"Berkeley.ETV.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I know it is a received Opinion, that by altering the Disposition of the Eyes, the Mind perceives whether the Angle of the Optic Axes, or the lateral Angles comprehended between the Interval of the Eyes and the Optic Axes, are made greater or lesser; and that accordingly by a kind of Natural Geometry, it judges the Point of their Intersection to be nearer, or farther off. But that this is not true, I am convinced by my own Experience, since I am not conscious, that I make any such use of the Perception I have by the Turn of my Eyes. And for me to make those Judgments, and draw those Conclusions from it, without knowing that I do so, seems altogether incomprehensible.","subId":"19","id":"Berkeley.ETV.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From all which it follows, that the Judgment we make of the Distance of an Object, viewed with both Eyes, is entirely the Result of Experience. If we had not constantly found certain Sensations arising from the various Disposition of the Eyes, attended with certain Degrees of Distance, we should never make those sudden Judgments from them, concerning the Distance of Objects: no more than we would pretend to judge of a Man's Thoughts by his pronouncing Words we had never heard before.","subId":"20","id":"Berkeley.ETV.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly</em>, An Object placed at a certain Distance from the Eye, to which the Breadth of the Pupil bears a considerable Proportion, being made to approach, is seen more confusedly: And the nearer it is brought, the more confused Appearance it makes.

No Man, I believe, will pretend to see or feel those imaginary Angles, that the Rays are supposed to form according to their various Inclinations on his Eye. But he cannot choose Seeing whether the Object appear more or less confused. It is therefore a manifest Consequence from what hath been demonstrated, that instead of the greater, or lesser Divergency of the Rays, the Mind makes use of the greater or lesser Confusedness of the Appearance, thereby to determine the apparent Place of an Object.","subId":"22","id":"Berkeley.ETV.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor doth it avail to say, there is not any necessary Connexion between confused Vision and Distance, great or small.

We are not to think, that Brutes and Children, or even grown reasonable Men, whenever they perceive an Object to approach, or depart from them, do it by virtue of Geometry and Demonstration.","subId":"24","id":"Berkeley.ETV.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That one Idea may suggest another to the Mind, it will suffice that they have been observed to go together, without any Demonstration of the Necessity of their Coexistence, or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist. Of this there are innumerable Instances, of which no one can be ignorant.","subId":"25","id":"Berkeley.ETV.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus, greater Confusion having been constantly attended with nearer Distance, no sooner is the former Idea perceived, but it suggests the latter to our Thoughts. And if it had been the ordinary Course of Nature, that the farther off an Object were placed, the more confused it should appear, it is certain, the very same Perception, that now makes us think an Object approaches, would then have made us to imagine it went farther off. That Perception, abstracting from Custom and Experience, being equally fitted to produce the Idea of great Distance, or small Distance, or no Distance at all.","subId":"26","id":"Berkeley.ETV.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Thirdly</em>, An Object being placed at the Distance above specified, and brought nearer to the Eye, we may nevertheless prevent, at least for some time, the Appearances growing more confused, by straining the Eye. In which Case, that Sensation supplies the place of confused Vision, in aiding the Mind to judge of the Distance of the Object; it being esteemed so much the nearer, by how much the Effort or Straining of the Eye in order to distinct Vision is greater.","subId":"27","id":"Berkeley.ETV.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have here set down those Sensations or Ideas, that seem to be the constant and general Occasions of introducing into the Mind the different Ideas of near Distance.

Concerning which, as well as all other the forementioned Occasions which suggest Distance, I shall only observe, they have none of them, in their own Nature, any Relation or Connexion with it: Nor is it possible, they should ever signify the various Degrees thereof, otherwise than as by Experience they have been found to be connected with them.","subId":"28","id":"Berkeley.ETV.28"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I shall proceed upon these Principles to account for a Phænomenon, which has hitherto strangely puzzled the Writers of Optics, and is so far from being accounted for by any of their Theories of Vision, that it is, by their own Confession, plainly repugnant to them: And of Consequence, if nothing else could be objected, were alone sufficient to bring their Credit in Question. The whole Difficulty I shall lay before you in the Words of the learned Dr. <em>Barrow</em>, with which he concludes his Optic Lectures. <cite>image</cite> <blockquote><span class=\"foreign\">Hæc sunt, quæ circa partem Opticæ præcipue Mathematicam dicenda mihi suggessit meditatio.

Illa, breviter, talis est: Lenti vel Speculo cavo E~B~F exponatur punctum visibile A, ita Distans ut Radii ex A manantes ex inflexione versus axem A~B cogantur. Sitque radiationis Limes (seu puncti A imago, qualem supra passim statuimus) punctum Z. Inter hoc autem &amp; inflectentis verticem B uspiam positus concipiatur Oculus. Quæri jam potest ubi loci debeat punctum A apparere? Retrorsum ad punctum Z videri non fert Natura (cum omnis impressio sensum afficiens proveniat a partibus A) ac experientia reclamat. Nostris autem e placitis consequi videtur, ipsum ad partes anticas apparens ab intervallo longissime dissito, (quod &amp; maximum sensibile quodvis Intervallum quodammodo exsuperet) apparere. Cum enim quo Radiis minus divergentibus attingitur Objectum, eo (seclusis utique prænotionibus &amp; præjudiciis) longius abesse sentiatur; et quod Parallelos ad Oculum Radios projicit, remotissime positum æstimetur. Exigere Ratio videtur, ut quod convergentibus radiis apprehenditur, adhuc magis, si fieri posset, quoad apparentiam elongetur. Quin &amp; circa Casum hunc generatim inquiri possit, quidnam omnino sit, quod apparentem puncti A locum determinet, faciatque quod constanti ratione nunc propius, nunc remotius appareat? Cui itidem dubio, nihil quicquam ex hactenus dictorum Analogia, responderi posse videtur, nisi debere punctum A perpetuo longissime semotum videri. Verum experientia secus attestatur, illud pro diversa Oculi inter puncta B, Z, positione varie distans; nunquam fere (si unquam) longinquius ipso A libere spectato, subinde vero multo propinquius adparere; quinimo, quo oculum appellentes radii magis convergunt eo speciem Objecti propius accedere.

Vobis itaque nodum hunc, utinam feliciore conatu, resolvendum committo.</span></blockquote> In English as follows. <blockquote>I have here delivered what my Thoughts have suggested to me, concerning that part of Optics which is more properly Mathematical. As for the other Parts of that Science (which being rather Physical, do consequently abound with plausible Conjectures instead of certain Principles) there has in them scarce any thing occur'd to my Observation, different from what has been already said by <em>Kepler, Scheinerus, Descartes</em>, and others. And methinks, I had better say nothing at all, than repeat that which has been so often said by others. I think it therefore high time to take my leave of this Subject: But before I quit it for good and all, the fair and ingenuous Dealing that I owe both to You and to Truth, obliges me to acquaint you with a certain untoward Difficulty, which seems directly opposite to the Doctrine I have been hitherto inculcating, at least, admits of no Solution from it. In short it is this. Before the double Convex Glass or Concave Speculum E~B~F, let the Point A be placed, at such a Distance that the Rays proceeding from A, after Refraction or Reflexion, be brought to Unite somewhere in the Ax A~B. And suppose the Point of Union (<em>i.e.</em> the Image of the Point A, as hath been already set forth) to be Z; between which and B, the Vertex of the Glass or Speculum, conceive the Eye to be any where placed. The Question now is, where the Point A ought to appear? Experience shews that it doth not appear behind at the Point Z, and it were contrary to Nature that it should; since all the Impression which affects the Sense comes from towards A. But from our Tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the Eye at a vast Distance off, so great as should in some Sort surpass all sensible Distance. For since if we exclude all Anticipations and Prejudices, every Object appears by so much the farther off, by how much the Rays it sends to the Eye are less diverging. And that Object is thought to be most remote, from which Parallel Rays proceed unto the Eye. Reason would make one think, that Object should appear, at yet a greater Distance, which is seen by converging Rays. Moreover it may in general be asked concerning this Case, what it is that determines the apparent Place of the Point A, and maketh it to appear after a constant manner, sometimes nearer, at other times farther off? To which Doubt, I see nothing that can be answered agreeable to the Principles we have laid down except only that the Point A ought always to appear extremely remote. But on the contrary, we are assured by Experience that the Point A appears variously distant, according to the different Situations of the Eye between the Points B and Z. And that it doth almost never (if at all) seem farther off, than it would if it were beheld by the naked Eye, but on the contrary, it doth sometimes appear much nearer. Nay, it is even certain, that by how much the Rays falling on the Eye do more converge, by so much the nearer doth the Object seem to approach. For the Eye being placed close to the Point B, the Object A appears nearly in its own natural Place, if the Point B is taken in the Glass, or at the same Distance, if in the Speculum. The Eye being brought back to O, the Object seems to draw near: and being come to P it beholds it still nearer. And so on by little and little, till at length the Eye being placed somewhere, suppose at Q, the Object appearing extremely near, begins to vanish into mere Confusion. All which doth seem repugnant to our Principles, at least, not rightly to agree with them. Nor is our Tenet alone struck at by this Experiment, but likewise all others that ever came to my Knowledge are, every whit as much, endangered by it. The ancient one especially (which is most commonly received, and comes nearest to mine) seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby, that the most learned <em>Tacquet</em> has been forced to reject that Principle, as false and uncertain, on which alone he had built almost his whole Catoptrics; and consequently by taking away the Foundation, hath himself pulled down the Superstructure he had raised on it. Which, nevertheless, I do not believe he would have done, had he but considered the whole Matter more thoroughly, and examined the Difficulty to the Bottom. But as for me, neither this, nor any other Difficulty shall have so great an Influence on me, as to make me renounce that which I know to be manifestly agreeable to Reason: Especially when, as it here falls out, the Difficulty is founded in the peculiar Nature of a certain odd and particular Case. For in the present Case something peculiar lies hid, which being involved in the Subtilty of Nature will, perhaps, hardly be discovered till such time, as the Manner of Vision is more perfectly made known. Concerning which, I must own, I have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least shew of Probability, not to mention Certainty. I shall, therefore, leave this Knot to be untied by you, wishing you may have better Success in it than I have had.</blockquote>","subId":"29","id":"Berkeley.ETV.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The ancient and received Principle, which Dr. <em>Barrow</em> here mentions as the main Foundation of <em>Tacquet</em>'s Catoptrics, is that <em>every visible Point seen by Reflexion from a Speculum, shall appear placed at the Intersection of the reflected Ray, and the Perpendicular of Incidence</em>. Which Intersection in the present Case, happening to be behind the Eye, it greatly shakes the Authority of that Principle, whereon the aforementioned Author proceeds throughout his whole Catoptrics, in determining the apparent Place of Objects seen by Reflexion from any kind of Speculum.","subId":"30","id":"Berkeley.ETV.30"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let us now see how this Phænomenon agrees with our Tenets. The Eye the nearer it is placed to the Point B in the foregoing Figures, the more distinct is the Appearance of the Object; but as it recedes to O, the Appearance grows more confused; and at P it sees the Object yet more confused; and so on till the Eye being brought back to Z, sees the Object in the greatest Confusion of all. Wherefore by Sect. XXI. the Object should seem to approach the Eye gradually, as it recedes from the Point B, that is at O it should (in Consequence of the Principle I have laid down in the aforesaid Section) seem nearer than it did at B, and at P nearer than at O, and at Q nearer than at P; and so on, till it quite vanishes at Z.

The <em>Englishman</em> would not fail to make a wrong Judgment, of the Ideas annexed to those Sounds, in the Mind of him that used them. Just so, in the present Case the Object speaks (if I may so say) with Words that the Eye is well acquainted with, that is, Confusions of Appearance; but whereas heretofore the greater Confusions were always wont to signify nearer Distances, they have in this Case a direct, contrary Signification, being connected with the greater Distances. Whence it follows, that the Eye must unavoidably be mistaken, since it will take the Confusions in the Sense it has been used to, which is directly opposed to the True.","subId":"32","id":"Berkeley.ETV.32"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Phænomenon as it entirely subverts the Opinion of those, who will have us judge of Distance by Lines and Angles, on which Supposition it is altogether inexplicable, so it seems to me no small Confirmation, of the Truth of that Principle whereby it is explained. But in order to a more full Explication of this Point, and to shew how far the Hypothesis of the Mind's judging by the various Divergency of Rays, may be of use in determining the apparent Place of an Object, it will be necessary to premise some few things, which are already well known to those who have any Skill in Dioptrics.","subId":"33","id":"Berkeley.ETV.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>First</em>, Any radiating Point is then distinctly seen when the Rays proceeding from it are, by the Refractive Power of the Crystalline, accurately reunited in the Retina or Fund of the Eye: But if they are reunited, either before they arrive at the Retina, or after they have past it, then there is confused Vision. <cite>image</cite>","subId":"34","id":"Berkeley.ETV.34"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly</em>, Suppose in the adjacent Figures N~P represent an Eye duly framed, and retaining its natural Figure. In Fig. 1. the Rays falling nearly Parallel on the Eye, are by the Crystalline A~B refracted, so as their Focus or Point of Union F falls exactly on the Retina: But if the Rays fall sensibly diverging on the Eye, as in Fig. 2. then their Focus falls beyond the Retina: Or if the Rays are made to converge by the Lens Q~S, before they come at the Eye, as in Fig. 3. their Focus F will fall before the Retina. In which two last Cases, it is evident from the foregoing Section, that the Appearance of the Point Z is confused. And by how much the greater is the Convergency, or Divergency of the Rays falling on the Pupil, by so much the farther will the Point of their Reunion be from the Retina, either before or behind it, and consequently the Point Z will appear, by so much the more confused. And this, by the bye, may shew us the Difference between confused, and faint Vision. Confused Vision is, when the Rays proceeding from each distinct Point of the Object are not accurately recollected in one corresponding Point on the Retina, but take up some Space thereon: So that Rays from different Points become mixed, and confused together. This is opposed to a distinct Vision, and attends near Objects. Faint Vision is, when by reason of the Distance of the Object or Grossness of the interjacent Medium few Rays arrive from the Object to the Eye. This is opposed to vigorous or clear Vision, and attends remote Objects.

Whence it follows, that the Eye viewing the Object Z through the Glass Q~S (which by Refraction causeth the Rays Z~Q, Z~S, <em>&amp;c.</em> to converge) should judge it to be at such a Nearness, at which if it were placed, it would radiate on the Eye with Rays diverging to that Degree, as would produce the same Confusion, which is now produced by converging Rays, <em>i. e.</em> would cover a Portion of the Retina equal to D~C. <em>vid.

Thus the Mind judging of the Distance of an Object, by the Confusedness of its Appearance, and this Confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked Eye, according as the Object is seen by Rays more or less diverging, it follows, that a Man may make use of the Divergency of the Rays in computing the apparent Distance, though not for its own sake, yet on account of the Confusion with which it is connected. But, so it is, the Confusion it self is entirely neglected by Mathematicians, as having no necessary Relation with Distance, such as the greater or lesser Angles of Divergency are conceived to have. And these (especially for that they fall under Mathematical Computation) are alone regarded, in determining the apparent Places of Objects, as though they were the sole and immediate Cause of the Judgments the Mind makes of Distance. Whereas, in Truth, they should not at all be regarded in themselves, or any otherwise, than as they are supposed to be the Cause of confused Vision.","subId":"38","id":"Berkeley.ETV.38"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing Oversight.

It having been observed, that the most diverging Rays brought into the Mind the Idea of nearest Distance, and that still, as the Divergency decreased, the Distance increased: and it being thought, the Connexion between the various Degrees of Divergency and Distance, was immediate; this naturally leads one to conclude, from an ill grounded Analogy, that converging Rays shall make an Object appear at an immense Distance: And that, as the Convergency increases, the Distance (if it were possible) should do so likewise. That this was the Cause of Dr. <em>Barrow</em>'s Mistake, is evident from his own Words which we have quoted. Whereas had the learned Doctor observed, that diverging and converging Rays, how opposite soever they may seem, do nevertheless agree in producing the same Effect, to wit, Confusedness of Vision, greater Degrees whereof are produced indifferently, either as the Divergency or Convergency of the Rays increaseth. And that it is by this Effect, which is the same in both, that either the Divergency or Convergency is perceived by the Eye; I say, had he but consider'd this, it is certain he would have made a quite contrary Judgment, and rightly concluded, that those Rays which fall on the Eye with greater Degrees of Convergency should make the Object from whence they proceed, appear by so much the nearer. But it is plain, it was impossible for any Man to attain to a right Notion of this Matter, so long as he had regard only to Lines and Angles, and did not apprehend the true Nature of Vision, and how far it was of Mathematical Consideration.","subId":"39","id":"Berkeley.ETV.39"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Before we dismiss this Subject, it is fit we take notice of a Query relating thereto, proposed by the ingenious Mr. <em>Molyneux</em>, in his Treatise of Dioptrics,<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> where speaking of this Difficulty, he has these Words: <q>And so he (<em>i. e.</em> Dr. <em>Barrow</em>) leaves this Difficulty to the Solution of others, which I (after so great an Example) shall do likewise; but with the Resolution of the same admirable Author of not quitting the evident Doctrine which we have before laid down, for determining the <em>Locus Objecti</em>, on account of being press'd by one Difficulty, which seems inexplicable till a more intimate Knowledge of the Visive Faculty be obtained by Mortals.

If therefore Mr. <em>Molyneux</em>'s Conjecture held good, it wou'd follow that the Eye should see the Object, twice as far off as it really is; and in other Cases at three or four times its due Distance, or more.

When from a Distance we behold great Objects, the Particles of the intermediate Air and Vapours, which are themselves unperceivable, do interrupt the Rays of Light, and thereby render the Appearance less strong and vivid: now, Faintness of Appearance caused in this Sort, hath been experienced to coexist with great Magnitude. But when it is caused by the Interposition of an opaque sensible Body, this Circumstance alters the Case, so that a faint Appearance this way caused, doth not suggest greater Magnitude, because it hath not been experienced to coexist with it.","subId":"72","id":"Berkeley.ETV.72"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Faintness, as well as all other Ideas or Perceptions which suggest Magnitude or Distance, doth it in the same way that Words suggest the Notions to which they are annexed. Now, it is known, a Word pronounced with certain Circumstances, or in a certain Context with other Words, hath not always the same Import and Signification, that it hath when pronounced in some other Circumstances, or different Context of Words. The very same Visible Appearance as to Faintness and all other Respects, if placed on high, shall not suggest the same Magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal Distance, on a level with the Eye. The Reason whereof is, that we are rarely accustomed to view Objects at a great Height; our Concerns lie among things situated rather before than above us; and accordingly our Eyes are not placed on the top of our Heads, but in such a Position, as is most convenient for us to see distant Objects standing in our way. And this Situation of them being a Circumstance, which usually attends the Vision of distant Objects, we may from hence account for (what is commonly observed) an Object's appearing of different Magnitude, even with respect to its Horizontal Extension, on the top of a Steeple, for example, an hundred Feet high to one standing below, from what it would if placed at an hundred Feet distance on a level with his Eye. For it hath been shewn, that the Judgment we make on the Magnitude of a thing, depends not on the visible Appearance alone, but also on divers other Circumstances, any one of which being omitted or varied may suffice to make some Alteration in our Judgment. Hence, the Circumstance of viewing a distant Object in such a Situation as is usual, and suits with the ordinary Posture of the Head and Eyes being omitted, and instead thereof a different Situation of the Object, which requires a different Posture of the Head taking place, it is not to be wondered at, if the Magnitude be judged different: but it will be demanded, why an high Object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low Object of the same Dimensions, for so it is observed to be: it may indeed be granted that the Variation of some Circumstances may vary the Judgment, made on the Magnitude of high Objects, which we are less used to look at: But it does not hence appear, why they should be judged less rather than greater? I answer, that in case the Magnitude of distant Objects was suggested by the Extent of their visible Appearance alone, and thought proportional thereto, it is certain they would then be judged much less than now they seem to be, <em>Vide</em> Sect. LXXIX. But, several Circumstances concurring to form the Judgment we make on the Magnitude of distant Objects, by means of which they appear far larger than others, whose visible Appearance hath an equal or even greater Extension; it follows, that upon the Change or Omission of any of those Circumstances, which are wont to attend the Vision of distant Objects, and so come to influence the Judgments made on their Magnitude, they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would. For any of those things that caused an Object to be thought greater, than in proportion to its visible Extension, being either omitted or applied without the usual Circumstances, the Judgment depends more intirely on the visible Extension, and consequently the Object must be judged less. Thus in the present Case, the Situation of the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those Objects we have occasion to view, and whose Magnitude we observe, it follows, that the very same Object, being an hundred Feet high, should seem less than if it was an hundred Feet off on (or nearly on) a level with the Eye.

How comes it therefore, to seem greater in one Situation than the other? What is it can put this Cheat on the Understanding? It has no other Perception of the Moon, than what it gets by Sight: And that which is seen, is of the same Extent, I say, the visible Appearance hath the same, or rather a less Magnitude when the Moon is viewed in the Horizontal, than when in the Meridional Position: And yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the latter. Herein consists the difficulty, which doth vanish and admit of a most easy Solution, if we consider that as the visible Moon is not greater in the Horizon than in the Meridian, so neither is it thought to be so. It hath been already shewn, that in any act of Vision, the visible Object absolutely, or in it self, is little taken notice of, the Mind still carrying its View from that to some tangible Ideas, which have been observed to be connected with it, and by that means come to be suggested by it. So that when a thing is said to appear great or small, or whatever Estimate be made of the Magnitude of any thing, this is meant not of the visible, but of the tangible Object. This duly considered, it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming Contradiction there is, that the Moon should appear of a different Bigness, the visible Magnitude thereof remaining still the same. For by Sect. LVI. the very same visible Extension, with a different Faintness, shall suggest a different tangible Extension. When therefore the horizontal Moon is said to appear greater than the meridional Moon, this must be understood not of a greater visible Extension, but of a greater tangible or real Extension, which by reason of the more than ordinary Faintness of the visible Appearance, is suggested to the Mind along with it.","subId":"74","id":"Berkeley.ETV.74"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Many Attempts have been made by Learned Men, to account for this Appearance. <em>Gassendus, Descartes, Hobbes</em>, and several others, have employed their Thoughts on that Subject; but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their Endeavours have been, is sufficiently shewn in <em>The Philosophical Transactions</em>,<a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> where you may see their several Opinions at large set forth and confuted, not without some Surprize at the gross Blunders that ingenious Men have been forced into, by endeavouring to reconcile this Appearance with the ordinary Principles of Optics.

Now, one way whereby we estimate the Distance of any thing, is by the Number and Extent of the intermediate Objects: When therefore the Moon is seen in the Horizon, the Variety of Fields, Houses, <em>&amp;c.</em> together with the large Prospect of the wide extended Land or Sea, that lies between the Eye and the utmost Limb of the Horizon, suggest unto the Mind the Idea of greater Distance, and consequently magnify the Appearance.

For in that Case, the Wall interposing cuts off all that Prospect of Sea and Land, <em>&amp;c.</em> which might otherwise increase the apparent Distance, and thereby the apparent Magnitude of the Moon. Nor will it suffice to say, the Memory doth even then suggest all that Extent of Land, <em>&amp;c.</em> which lies within the Horizon; which Suggestion occasions a sudden Judgment of Sense, that the Moon is farther off and larger than usual. For ask any Man, who from such a Station beholding the horizontal Moon, shall think her greater than usual, whether he hath at that time in his Mind any Idea of the intermediate Objects, or long Tract of Land that lies between his Eye and the extreme Edge of the Horizon? And whether it be that Idea which is the Cause of his making the aforementioned Judgment? He will, I suppose, reply in the Negative, and declare the horizontal Moon shall appear greater than the meridional, though he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it. <em>Secondly</em>, It seems impossible by this Hypothesis, to account for the Moon's appearing in the very same Situation, at one time greater than at another; which nevertheless has been shewn to be very agreeable to the Principles we have laid down, and receives a most easy and natural Explication from them. For the further clearing up of this Point, it is to be observed that what we immediately and properly see are only Lights and Colours in sundry Situations and Shades, and Degrees of Faintness and Clearness, Confusion and Distinctness. All which visible Objects are only in the Mind, nor do they suggest ought external, whether Distance or Magnitude, otherwise than by habitual Connexion as Words do Things.

Now, as these customary, experimental means of suggesting Distance, do likewise suggest Magnitude, so they suggest the one as immediately as the other. I say, they do not (<em>Vide</em> Sect.

There is, at this Day, no one Ignorant, that the Pictures of external Objects are painted on the <em>Retina</em>, or Fund of the Eye. That we can see nothing which is not so painted: And that, according as the Picture is more distinct or confused, so also is the Perception we have of the Object: But then in this Explication of Vision, there occurs one mighty Difficulty.

It is customary to call written Words, and the Things they signify, by the same Name: For Words not being regarded in their own Nature, or otherwise than as they are Marks of Things, it had been superfluous, and beside the design of Language, to have given them Names distinct from those of the Things marked by them. The same Reason holds here also. Visible Figures are the Marks of tangible Figures, and from Sect.

The Square perceived by Touch, hath four distinct, equal Sides, so also hath it four distinct, equal Angles. It is therefore necessary, that the visible Figure which shall be most proper to mark it, contain four distinct equal Parts corresponding to the four Sides of the tangible Square; as likewise four other distinct and equal Parts, whereby to denote the four equal Angles of the tangible Square.

Now, in this respect, Words are not arbitrary, it not being indifferent, what written Word stands for any Sound: But it is requisite, that each Word contain in it so many distinct Characters, as there are Variations in the Sound it stands for. Thus the single Letter <em>a</em> is proper to mark one simple uniform Sound; and the word <em>Adultery</em> is accommodated to represent the Sound annexed to it, in the Formation whereof, there being eight different Collisions, or Modifications of the Air by the Organs of Speech, each of which produces a difference of Sound, it was fit the Word representing it should consist of as many distinct Characters, thereby to mark each particular Difference or Part of the whole Sound: And yet no Body, I presume, will say, the single Letter <em>a</em>, or the Word <em>Adultery</em> are like unto, or of the same Species with the respective Sounds by them represented.
