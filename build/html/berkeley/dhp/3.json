This makes you dream of those unknown Natures in every thing. It is this occasions your distinguishing between the Reality and sensible Appearance of Things. It is to this you are indebted for being ignorant of what every Body else knows perfectly well. Nor is this all: You are not only ignorant of the true Nature of every Thing, but you know not whether any thing really exists, or whether there are any true Natures at all; forasmuch as you attribute to your material Beings an absolute or external Existence, wherein you suppose their Reality consists. And as you are forced in the end to acknowledge such an Existence means either a direct Repugnancy, or nothing at all, it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own Hypothesis of material Substance, and positively to deny the real Existence of any Part of the Universe.

I will no longer spend my Breath in defence of it. But whatever Hypothesis you advance, or whatsoever Scheme of Things you introduce in its stead, I doubt not it will appear every whit as false: Let me but be allowed to question you upon it. This is, suffer me to serve you in your own kind, and I warrant it shall conduct you through as many Perplexities and Contradictions, to the very same State of Scepticism that I my self am in at present.","subId":"20","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.20","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I assure you, <em>Hylas</em>, I do not pretend to frame any Hypothesis at all. I am of a vulgar Cast, simple enough to believe my Senses, and leave Things as I find them. To be plain, it is my Opinion, that the real Things are those very Things I see and feel, and perceive by my Senses. These I know, and finding they answer all the Necessities and Purposes of Life, have no reason to be solicitous about any other unknown Beings. A Piece of sensible Bread, for Instance, would stay my Stomach better than ten thousand times as much of that insensible, unintelligible, real Bread you speak of. It is likewise my Opinion, that Colours and other sensible Qualities are on the Objects. I cannot for my Life help thinking that Snow is white, and Fire hot. You indeed, who by <em>Snow</em> and <em>Fire</em> mean certain external, unperceived, unperceiving Substances, are in the right to deny Whiteness or Heat to be Affections inherent in them. But I, who understand by those Words the Things I see and feel, am obliged to think like other Folks. And as I am no Sceptic with regard to the Nature of Things, so neither am I as to their Existence. That a thing should be really perceived by my Senses, and at the same time not really exist, is to me a plain Contradiction; since I cannot prescind or abstract, even in Thought, the Existence of a sensible Thing from its being perceived. Wood, Stones, Fire, Water, Flesh, Iron, and the like Things, which I name and discourse of, are Things that I know. And I should not have known them, but that I perceived them by my Senses; and Things perceived by the Senses are immediately perceived; and Things immediately perceived are Ideas; and Ideas cannot exist without the Mind; their Existence therefore consists in being perceived; when therefore they are actually perceived, there can be no doubt of their Existence. Away then with all that Scepticism, all those ridiculous philosophical Doubts. What a Jest is it for a Philosopher to question the Existence of sensible Things, till he hath it proved to him from the Veracity of God: Or to pretend our Knowledge in this Point falls short of Intuition or Demonstration? I might as well doubt of my own Being, as of the Being of those Things I actually see and feel.","subId":"21","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.21","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Not so fast, <em>Philonous</em>: you say you cannot conceive how sensible Things should exist without the Mind.

When I deny sensible Things an Existence out of the Mind, I do not mean my Mind in particular, but all Minds. Now it is plain they have an Existence exterior to my Mind, since I find them by Experience to be independent of it. There is therefore some other Mind wherein they exist, during the Intervals between the Times of my perceiving them: As likewise they did before my Birth, and would do after my supposed Annihilation. And as the same is true, with regard to all other finite created Spirits; it necessarily follows, there is an <em>Omnipresent Eternal Mind</em>, which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our View in such a manner, and according to such Rules as He Himself hath ordained, and are by us termed the <em>Laws of Nature</em>.","subId":"25","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.25","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Answer me, <em>Philonous</em>.

I do nevertheless know, that I who am a Spirit or thinking Substance, exist as certainly, as I know my Ideas exist. Farther, I know what I mean by the terms <em>I</em> and <em>Myself</em>; and I know this immediately, or intuitively, though I do not perceive it as I perceive a Triangle, a Colour, or a Sound. The Mind, Spirit or Soul, is that indivisible unextended Thing, which thinks, acts, and perceives. I say <em>indivisible</em>, because unextended; and <em>unextended</em>, because extended, figured, moveable Things, are Ideas; and that which perceives Ideas, which thinks and wills, is plainly it self no Idea, nor like an Idea. Ideas are Things inactive, and perceived: And Spirits a sort of Beings altogether different from them. I do not therefore say my Soul is an Idea, or like an Idea. However, taking the Word <em>Idea</em> in a large Sense, my Soul can be said to furnish me with an Idea, that is, an Image, or Likeness of God, though indeed extremely inadequate. For all the Notion I have of God, is obtained by reflecting on my own Soul heightning its Powers, and removing its Imperfections. I have therefore, though not an inactive Idea, yet in my self some sort of an active thinking Image of the Deity. And though I perceive Him not by Sense, yet I have a Notion of Him, or know him by Reflexion and Reasoning. My own Mind and my own Ideas I have an immediate Knowledge of; and by the help of these, do mediately apprehend the Possibility of the Existence of other Spirits and Ideas. Farther, from my own Being, and from the Dependency I find in my self and my Ideas, I do by an Act of Reason, necessarily infer the Existence of a God, and all created Things in the Mind of God. So much for your first Question. For the second: I suppose by this time you can answer it your self. For you neither perceive Matter objectively, as you do an inactive Being or Idea, nor know it, as you do your self by a reflex Act: Neither do you mediately apprehend it by Similitude of the one or the other: Nor yet collect it by Reasoning from that which you know immediately. All which makes the Case of <em>Matter</em> widely different from that of the <em>Deity</em>.","subId":"33","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.33","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"You say your own Soul supplies you with some sort of an Idea or Image of God. But at the same time you acknowledge you have, properly speaking, no Idea of your own Soul. You even affirm that Spirits are a sort of Beings altogether different from Ideas. Consequently that no Idea can be like a Spirit. We have therefore no Idea of any Spirit. You admit nevertheless that there is spiritual Substance, although you have no Idea of it; while you deny there can be such a thing as material Substance, because you have no Notion or Idea of it. Is this fair Dealing? To act consistently, you must either admit Matter or reject Spirit. What say you to this?","subId":"34","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.34","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I say in the first place, that I do not deny the Existence of material Substance, merely because I have no Notion of it, but because the Notion of it is inconsistent, or in other words, because it is repugnant that there should be a Notion of it. Many things, for ought I know, may exist, whereof neither I nor any other Man hath or can have any Idea or Notion whatsoever. But then those things must be possible, that is, nothing inconsistent must be included in their Definition. I say secondly, that although we believe things to exist which we do not perceive; yet we may not believe that any particular thing exists, without some reason for such Belief: But I have no reason for believing the Existence of Matter. I have no immediate Intuition thereof: neither can I immediately from my Sensations, Ideas, Notions, Actions or Passions, infer an unthinking, unperceiving, inactive Substance, either by probable Deduction, or necessary Consequence. Whereas the Being of my self, that is, my own Soul, Mind or thinking Principle, I evidently know by Reflexion. You will forgive me if I repeat the same things in answer to the same Objections. In the very Notion or Definition of material Substance, there is included a manifest Repugnance and Inconsistency. But this cannot be said of the Notion of Spirit. That Ideas should exist in what doth not perceive, or be produced by what doth not act, is repugnant. But it is no Repugnancy to say, that a perceiving Thing should be the Subject of Ideas, or an active Thing the Cause of them. It is granted we have neither an immediate Evidence nor a demonstrative Knowledge of the Existence of other finite Spirits; but it will not thence follow that such Spirits are on a foot with material Substances: if to suppose the one to be inconsistent, and it be not inconsistent to suppose the other; if the one can be inferred by no Argument, and there is a Probability for the other; if we see Signs and Effects indicating distinct finite Agents like our selves, and see no Sign or Symptom whatever that leads to a rational Belief of Matter. I say lastly, that I have a Notion of Spirit, though I have not, strictly speaking, an Idea of it. I do not perceive it as an Idea or by Means of an Idea, but know it by Reflexion.","subId":"35","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.35","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Notwithstanding all you have said, to me it seems, that according to your own way of thinking, and in consequence of your own Principles, it should follow that you are only a System of floating Ideas, without any Substance to support them. Words are not to be used without a meaning.

I know that I, one and the same self, perceive both Colours and Sounds: that a Colour cannot perceive a Sound, nor a Sound a Colour: That I am therefore one individual Principle, distinct from Colour and Sound; and, for the same reason, from all other sensible things and inert Ideas. But I am not in like manner conscious either of the Existence or Essence of Matter. On the contrary, I know that nothing inconsistent can exist, and that the Existence of Matter implies an Inconsistency. Farther, I know what I mean, when I affirm that there is a spiritual Substance or Support of Ideas, that is, That a Spirit knows and perceives Ideas. But I do not know what is meant, when it is said, that an unperceiving Substance hath inherent in it and supports either Ideas or the Archetypes of Ideas. There is therefore upon the whole no parity of case between Spirit and Matter.","subId":"37","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.37","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I own my self satisfied in this point.

But then to a Christian it cannot surely be shocking to say, The real Tree existing without his Mind is truly known and comprehended by (that is, <em>exists in</em>) the infinite Mind of God. Probably he may not at first glance be aware of the direct and immediate Proof there is of this, inasmuch as the very Being of a Tree, or any other sensible Thing, implies a Mind wherein it is. But the Point it self he cannot deny. The Question between the Materialists and me is not, whether Things have a real Existence out of the Mind of this or that Person, but whether they have an absolute Existence, distinct from being perceived by God, and exterior to all Minds. This indeed some Heathens and Philosophers have affirmed, but whoever entertains Notions of the Deity suitable to the Holy Scriptures, will be of another Opinion.","subId":"43","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.43","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But according to your Notions, what Difference is there between real Things, and Chimeras formed by the Imagination, or the Visions of a Dream, since they are all equally in the Mind?","subId":"44","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.44","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Ideas formed by the Imagination are faint and indistinct; they have besides an intire Dependence on the Will. But the Ideas perceived by Sense, that is, real Things, are more vivid and clear, and being imprinted on the Mind by a Spirit distinct from us, have not the like Dependence on our Will. There is therefore no Danger of confounding these with the foregoing: and there is as little of confounding them with the Visions of a Dream, which are dim, irregular, and confused. And though they should happen to be never so lively and natural, yet by their not being connected, and of a piece with the preceding and subsequent Transactions of our Lives, they might easily be distinguished from Realities. In short, by whatever Method you distinguish <em>Things</em> from <em>Chimeras</em> on your own Scheme, the same, it is evident, will hold also upon mine. For it must be, I presume, by some perceived Difference, and I am not for depriving you of any one thing that you perceive.","subId":"45","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.45","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But still, <em>Philonous</em>, you hold, there is nothing in the World but Spirits and Ideas.

My Reason for using it was, because a necessary Relation to the Mind is understood to be implied by that Term; and it is now commonly used by Philosophers, to denote the immediate Objects of the Understanding. But however odly the Proposition may sound in Words, yet it includes nothing so very strange or shocking in its Sense, which in effect amounts to no more than this, to wit, that there are only Things perceiving, and Things perceived; or that every unthinking Being is necessarily, and from the very Nature of its Existence, perceived by some Mind; if not by a finite created Mind, yet certainly by the infinite Mind of God, in whom <em>we live, and move, and have our Being</em>. Is this as strange as to say, The sensible Qualities are not on the Objects: Or, That we cannot be sure of the Existence of Things, or know any thing of their real Natures, though we both see and feel them, and perceive them by all our Senses?","subId":"47","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.47","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And in Consequence of this, must we not think there are no such Things as Physical or Corporeal Causes; but that a Spirit is the immediate Cause of all the <em>Ph&aelig;nomena</em> in Nature?

Besides, that which to you, I know not for what Reason, seems so extravagant, is no more than the Holy Scriptures assert in a hundred Places. In them God is represented as the sole and immediate Author of all those Effects, which some Heathens and Philosophers are wont to ascribe to Nature, Matter, Fate, or the like unthinking Principle. This is so much the constant Language of Scripture, that it were needless to confirm it by Citations.","subId":"49","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.49","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"You are not aware, <em>Philonous</em>, that in making God the immediate Author of all the Motions in Nature, you make him the Author of Murder, Sacrilege, Adultery, and the like heinous Sins.","subId":"50","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.50","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In Answer to that, I observe first, that the Imputation of Guilt is the same, whether a Person commits an Action with or without an Instrument. In case therefore you suppose God to act by the Mediation of an Instrument, or Occasion, called <em>Matter</em>, you as truly make Him the Author of Sin as I, who think Him the immediate Agent in all those Operations vulgarly ascribed to Nature. I farther observe, that Sin or moral Turpitude doth not consist in the outward Physical Action or Motion, but in the internal Deviation of the Will from the Laws of Reason and Religion. This is plain, in that the killing an Enemy in a Battle, or putting a Criminal legally to Death, is not thought sinful, though the outward Act be the very same with that in the Case of Murder. Since therefore Sin doth not consist in the Physical Action, the making God an immediate Cause of all such Actions, is not making him the Author of Sin. Lastly, I have no where said that God is the only Agent who produces all the Motions in Bodies. It is true, I have denied there are any other Agents besides Spirits: But this is very consistent with allowing to Thinking Rational Beings, in the Production of Motions, the Use of limited Powers, ultimately indeed derived from God, but immediately under the Direction of their own Wills, which is sufficient to intitle them to all the Guilt of their Actions.","subId":"51","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.51","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the denying Matter, Philonous, or corporeal Substance; there is the Point. You can never persuade me that this is not repugnant to the universal Sense of Mankind. Were our Dispute to be determined by most Voices, I am confident you would give up the Point, without gathering the Votes.","subId":"52","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.52","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I wish both our Opinions were fairly stated and submitted to the Judgment of Men who had plain common Sense, without the Prejudices of a learned Education. Let me be represented as one who trusts his Senses, who thinks he knows the Things he sees and feels, and entertains no Doubts, of their Existence; and you fairly set forth with all your Doubts, your Paradoxes, and your Scepticism about you, and I shall willingly acquiesce in the Determination of any indifferent Person. That there is no Substance wherein Ideas can exist beside Spirit, is to me evident. And that the Objects immediately perceived are Ideas, is on all Hands agreed. And that sensible Qualities are Objects immediately perceived, no one can deny. It is evident there can be no <em>Substratum</em> of those Qualities but Spirit, in which they exist, not by way of Mode or Property, but as a thing perceived in that which perceives it. I deny therefore that there is any unthinking <em>Substratum</em> of the Objects of Sense, and in that Acceptation that there is any material Substance. But if by <em>material Substance</em> is meant only sensible Body, that which is seen and felt, (and the unphilosophical Part of the World, I dare say, mean no more) then I am more certain of Matter's Existence than you, or any other Philosopher, pretend to be. If there be any thing which makes the Generality of Mankind averse from the Notions I espouse, it is a Misapprehension that I deny the Reality of sensible Things: But as it is you who are guilty of that and not I, it follows that in truth their Aversion is against your Notions, and not mine. I do therefore assert that I am as certain as of my own Being, that there are Bodies or corporeal Substances, (meaning the Things I perceive by my Senses) and that granting this, the Bulk of Mankind will take no Thought about, nor think themselves at all concerned in the Fate of those unknown Natures, and Philosophical Quiddities, which some Men are so fond of.","subId":"53","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.53","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What say you to this? Since, according to you, Men judge of the Reality of Things by their Senses, how can a Man be mistaken in thinking the Moon a plain lucid Surface, about a Foot in Diameter; or a square Tower, seen at a distance, round; or an Oar, with one End in the Water, crooked?","subId":"54","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.54","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"He is not mistaken with regard to the Ideas he actually perceives; but in the Inferences he makes from his present Perceptions. Thus in the Case of the Oar, what he immediately perceives by Sight is certainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence conclude, that on taking the Oar out of the Water he shall perceive the same Crookedness; or that it would affect his Touch, as crooked things are wont to do: In that he is mistaken. In like manner, if he shall conclude from what he perceives in one Station, that in case he advances toward the Moon or Tower, he should still be affected with the like Ideas, he is mistaken.

We are chained to a Body, that is to say, our Perceptions are connected with corporeal Motions. By the Law of our Nature we are affected upon every Alteration in the nervous Parts of our sensible Body: Which sensible Body rightly considered, is nothing but a Complexion of such Qualities or Ideas, as have no Existence distinct from being perceived by a Mind: So that this Connexion of Sensations with corporeal Motions, means no more than a Correspondence in the Order of Nature between two Sets of Ideas, or Things immediately perceivable.

Therefore to avoid this as well as other Inconveniences which are obvious upon a little Thought, Men combine together several Ideas, apprehended by divers Senses, or by the same Sense at different times, or in different Circumstances, but observed however to have some Connexion in Nature, either with respect to Coexistence or Succession; all which they refer to one Name, and consider as one Thing.

When I say the Being of a <em>God</em>, I do not mean an obscure general Cause of Things, whereof we have no Conception, but <em>God</em>, in the strict and proper Sense of the Word. A Being whose Spirituality, Omnipresence, Providence, Omniscience, Infinite Power and Goodness, are as conspicuous as the Existence of sensible Things, of which (notwithstanding the fallacious Pretences and affected Scruples of <em>Scepticks</em>) there is no more reason to doubt, than of our own Being. Then with relation to Humane Sciences; in Natural Philosophy, what Intricacies, what Obscurities, what Contradictions, hath the Belief of Matter led Men into! To say nothing of the numberless Disputes about its Extent, Continuity, Homogeneity, Gravity, Divisibility, <em>&amp;c.</em> do they not pretend to explain all things by Bodies operating on Bodies, according to the Laws of Motion? and yet, are they able to comprehend how one Body should move another? Nay, admitting there was no Difficulty in reconciling the Notion of an inert Being with a Cause; or in conceiving how an Accident might pass from one Body to another; yet by all their strained Thoughts and extravagant Suppositions, have they been able to reach the mechanical Production of any one Animal or Vegetable Body? Can they account by the Laws of Motion, for Sounds, Tastes, Smells, or Colours, or for the regular Course of Things? Have they accounted by Physical Principles for the Aptitude and Contrivance, even of the most inconsiderable Parts of the Universe? But laying aside Matter and corporeal Causes, and admitting only the Efficiency of an All-perfect Mind, are not all the Effects of Nature easy and intelligible? If the <em>Ph&aelig;nomema</em> are nothing else but <em>Ideas</em>; God is a <em>Spirit</em>, but Matter an unintelligent, unperceiving Being. If they demonstrate an unlimited Power in their Cause; God is Active and Omnipotent, but Matter an inert Mass. If the Order, Regularity, and Usefulness of them, can never be sufficiently admired; God is infinitely Wise and Provident, but Matter destitute of all Contrivance and Design. These surely are great Advantages in <em>Physics</em>. Not to mention that the Apprehension of a distant Deity, naturally disposes Men to a Negligence in their <em>moral</em> Actions, which they would be more cautious of, in case they thought Him immediately present, and acting on their Minds without the Interposition of Matter, or unthinking Second Causes. Then in <em>Metaphysics</em>; what Difficulties concerning Entity in Abstract, Substantial Forms, Hylarchic Principles, Plastic Natures, Substance and Accident, Principle of Individuation, Possibility of Matter's thinking, Origin of Ideas, the Manner how two independent Substances, so widely different as <em>Spirit</em> and <em>Matter</em>, should mutually operate on each other? What Difficulties, I say, and endless Disquisitions concerning these and innumerable other the like Points, do we escape by supposing only Spirits and Ideas? Even the <em>Mathematicks</em> themselves, if we take away the absolute Existence of extended Things, become much more clear and easy; the most shocking Paradoxes and intricate Speculations in those Sciences, depending on the infinite Divisibility of finite Extension, which depends on that Supposition.

Or can you produce so much as one Argument against the Reality of corporeal Things, or in behalf of that avowed utter Ignorance of their Natures, which doth not suppose their Reality to consist in an external absolute Existence?

And in Philosophical Discourses it seems the best way to leave it quite out; since there is not perhaps any one thing that hath more favoured and strengthned the depraved Bent of the Mind towards <em>Atheism</em>, than the Use of that general confused Term.","subId":"177","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.177","speaker":"Phil"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Well but, <em>Philonous</em>, since I am content to give up the Notion of an unthinking Substance exterior to the Mind, I think you ought not to deny me the Privilege of using the Word <em>Matter</em> as I please, and annexing it to a Collection of sensible Qualities subsisting only in the Mind. I freely own there is no other Substance in a strict Sense, than <em>Spirit</em>. But I have been so long accustomed to the Term <em>Matter</em>, that I know not how to part with it. To say, There is no <em>Matter</em> in the World, is still shocking to me. Whereas to say, There is no <em>Matter</em>, if by that Term be meant an unthinking Substance existing without the Mind: But if by <em>Matter</em> is meant some sensible Thing, whose Existence consists in being perceived, then there is <em>Matter</em>: This Distinction gives it quite another Turn: And Men will come into your Notions with small Difficulty, when they are proposed in that manner. For after all, the Controversy about <em>Matter</em> in the strict Acceptation of it, lies altogether between you and the Philosophers; whose Principles, I acknowledge, are not near so natural, or so agreeable to the common Sense of Mankind, and Holy Scripture, as yours. There is nothing we either desire or shun, but as it makes, or is apprehended to make some Part of our Happiness or Misery. But what hath Happiness or Misery, Joy or Grief, Pleasure or Pain, to do with absolute Existence, or with unknown Entities, abstracted from all Relation to us? It is evident, Things regard us only as they are pleasing or displeasing: And they can please or displease, only so far forth as they are perceived. Farther therefore we are not concerned; and thus far you leave things as you found them. Yet still there is something new in this Doctrine. It is plain, I do not now think with the Philosophers, nor yet altogether with the Vulgar. I would know how the Case stands in that respect: Precisely, what you have added to, or altered in my former Notions.","subId":"178","id":"Berkeley.DHP.3.178","speaker":"Hyl"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I do not pretend to be a Setter-up of <em>New Notions</em>. My Endeavours tend only to unite and place in a clearer Light that Truth, which was before shared between the Vulgar and the Philosophers: the former being of Opinion, that <em>those Things they immediately perceive are the real Things</em>; and the latter, that <em>the Things immediately perceived, are Ideas which exist only in the Mind</em>.
