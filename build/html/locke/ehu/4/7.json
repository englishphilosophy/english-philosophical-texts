It may however be worth while, to enquire into the reason of their evidence, and see whether it be peculiar to them alone; and also examine how far they influence and govern our other Knowledge.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Knowledge,</em> as has been shewn, consists in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of <em>Ideas</em>: Now <em>where</em> that <em>agreement or disagreement is perceived immediately by it self, without the intervention</em> or help <em>of any other, there our Knowledge is self-evident.</em> This will appear to be so to any one, who will but consider any of these Propositions, which, without any proof, he assents to at first sight: for in all these he will find, that the reason of his Assent, is from that agreement or disagreement the Mind, by an immediate comparing them, finds in those <em>Ideas</em> answering the Affirmation or Negation in the Proposition.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This being so, in the next place let us consider, whether this Self-evident be peculiar only to these Propositions, which are received for Maxims, and have the dignity of Axioms allowed them; and here 'tis plain, that several other Truths, not allow'd to be Axioms, partake equally with them in this Self-evidence. This we shall see, if we go over these several sorts of agreement or disagreement of <em>Ideas,</em> which I have above mentioned, <em>viz.</em> Identity, Relation, Co-existence, and real Existence; which will discover to us, that <em>not only</em> those few Propositions, which have had the credit of <em>Maxims, are self-evident, but a great many,</em> even almost an infinite number of <em>other Propositions</em> are such.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For, <em>First,</em> the immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of <em>Identity,</em> being founded in the Mind's having distinct <em>Ideas,</em> this affords us as many self-evident Propositions, as we have distinct <em>Ideas.</em> Every one that has any Knowledge at all, has, as the foundation of it, various and distinct <em>Ideas</em>: And it is the first act of the Mind, (without which, it can never be capable of any Knowledge,) to know every one of its <em>Ideas</em> by it self, and distinguish it from others. This is that which every one finds in himself, that the <em>Ideas</em> he has knows; he knows also when any one is in his Understanding, and what it is: And when more than one are there, he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another: Which always being so, (it being impossible but that he should perceive what he perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any <em>Idea</em> is in his Mind, that it is there, and is that <em>Idea</em> it is; and that two distinct <em>Ideas,</em> when they are in his Mind, are there, and are not one and the same <em>Idea.</em> So that all such Affirmations, and Negations, are made without any possibility of doubt, uncertainty, or hesitation, and must necessarily be assented to, as soon as understood; that is, as soon as we have, in our Minds, the <em>Ideas</em> clear and distinct, which the Terms in the Proposition stand for. It is not therefore alone to these two general Propositions, <em>Whatsoever is, is</em>; and, <em>It is impossible for the same Thing to be, and not to be,</em> that this Self-evidence belongs by any peculiar right. The perception of being, or not being, belongs no more no these vague <em>Ideas,</em> signified by the terms <em>Whatsoever,</em> and <em>Thing,</em> than it does to any other <em>Ideas.</em> The Mind, without the help of any proof, perceives as clearly, and knows as certainly, that the <em>Idea</em> of <em>White,</em> is the <em>Idea</em> of White, and not the <em>Idea</em> of Blue; and that the <em>Idea</em> of White, when it is in the Mind, is there, and is not absent; and so a <em>Triangle, Motion,</em> a <em>Man,</em> or any other <em>Ideas</em> whatsoever. So that in respect of Identity, our intuitive Knowledge reaches as far as our <em>Ideas</em>: And so we are capable of making as many self-evident Propositions, as we have names for distinct <em>Ideas.</em> And I appeal to ever one's own Mind, whether this Proposition, <em>A Circle is a Circle,</em> be not as self-evident a Proposition, as that consisting of more general terms, <em>Whatsoever is, is</em>: And again, whether this Proposition, <em>Blue is not Red,</em> be not a Proposition that the Mind can no more doubt of, as soon as it understands the Words, than it does of that Axiom, <em>It is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be?</em> and so of all the like.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly,</em> As to <em>Co-existence,</em> or such a necessary connexion between two <em>Ideas,</em> that in the Subject where one of them is supposed, there the other must necessarily be also: Of such agreement, or disagreement as this, the Mind has an immediate perception but in very few of them. And therefore in this sort, we have but very little intuitive Knowledge: nor are there to be found very many Propositions that are self-evident, though some there are; <em>v. g.</em> the <em>Idea</em> of filling of a place equal to the Contents of its superficies, being annexed to our <em>Idea</em> of Body, I think it is a self-evident Proposition, <em>That two Bodies cannot be in the same place.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Thirdly,</em> As to the <em>Relations</em> of Modes, Mathematicians have framed many Axioms concerning that one Relation of Equality. As Equals taken from Equals, the remainder will be Equals; which, with the rest of that kind, however they are received for Maxims by the Mathematicians, and are unquestionable Truths; yet, I think, that any one who considers them, will not find, that they have a clearer self-evidence than these, that one and one, are equal to two; that if you take from the five Fingers of one Hand two, and from the five Fingers of the other Hand two, the remaining number will be equal. These, and a thousand other such Propositions, may be found in Numbers, which, at very first hearing, force the assent, and carry with them an equal, if not greater clearness, than those mathematical Axioms.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Fourthly,</em> As to <em>real Existence,</em> since that has no connexion with any other of our <em>Ideas,</em> but that of our selves, and of a first Being, we have in that, concerning the real existence of all other Beings, not so much as demonstrative, much less a self-evident Knowledge: And therefore concerning those there are no Maxims,","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the next place let us consider, <em>what influence those received Maxims have, upon the other parts of our Knowledge.</em> The Rules established in the Schools, that all Reasonings are <em>ex praecognitis, &amp; prac incessis,</em> seem to lay the foundation of all other Knowledge, in these Maxims, and to suppose them to be <em>praecognita</em>; whereby, I think, is meant these two things: First, That these Axioms, are those Truths that are first known to the Mind; and, secondly, That upon them, the other parts of our Knowledge depend.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>First,</em> That they are not the <em>Truths first known</em> to the Mind, is evident to Experience. Who perceives not, that a Child certainly knows, that a Stranger is not its Mother; that its Sucking-bottle is not the Rod, long before he knows, that <em>'tis impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be.</em> And how many Truths are there about Numbers, which it is obvious to observe, that the Mind is perfectly acquainted with, and ully convinced of, before it ever thought on these general Maxims, to which Mathematicians, in their Arguings, do sometimes refer them? Whereof the reason is very plain: For that which makes the Mind assent to such Propositions, being nothing else but the perception it has of the agreement, or disagreement of its <em>Ideas,</em> according as it finds them affirmed or denied one of another, in Words it understands; and every <em>Idea</em> being known to be what it is, and every two distinct <em>Ideas</em> not to be same, it must necessarily follow, that such self-evident Truths, must be first known, which consist of <em>Ideas</em> that are first in the Mind: and the <em>Ideas</em> first in the Mind, 'tis evident, are those of particuliar Things, from whence, by slow degrees, the Understanding proceeds to some few general ones; which being taken from the ordinary and familiar Objects of Sense, are setled in the Mind, with general Names to them. Thus particular <em>Ideas</em> are first received and distinguished, and so Knowledge got about them: and next to them, the less general, or specifick, which are next to particular. For abstract <em>Ideas</em> are not so obvious or easie to Children, or the yet unexercised Mind, as particular ones. If they seem so to grown Men, 'tis only because by constant and familiar use they are made so: For when we necely reflect upon them, we shall find, that general <em>Ideas</em> are Fictions and Contrivances of the Mind, that carry difficulty with them, and do not so easily offer themselves, as we are apt to imagine. For example, Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general <em>Idea</em> of a Triangle, (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive, and difficult,) for it must be neither Oblique, nor Rectangle, neither Equilateral, Equicrural, nor Scalenon; but all and none of these at once. In effect, it is something imperfect, that cannot exist; an <em>Idea</em> wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent <em>Ideas</em> are put together. 'Tis true, the Mind in this imperfect state, has need of such <em>Ideas,</em> and makes all the haste to them it can, for the conveniency of Communication, and Enlargement of Knowledge; to both which, it is naturally very much enclined. But yet one has reason to suspect such <em>Ideas</em> are marks of our Imperfection; at least, this is enough to shew, that the most abstract and general <em>Ideas,</em> are not those that the Mind is first and most easily acquainted with, nor such as its earliest Knowledge is conversant about.","subId":"9","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly,</em> From what has been said, it plainly follows, that <em>these</em> magnified <em>Maxims, are not the Principles and Foundations of all our other Knowledge.</em> For if there be a great many other Truths, which have as much self-evidence as they, and a great many that we know before them, it is impossible they should be the Principles, from which we deduce all other Truths. Is it impossible to know that <em>One</em> and <em>Two</em> are equal to <em>Three,</em> but by virtue of this, or some such Axiom, <em>viz.</em> the Whole is equal to all its Parts taken together? Many a one knows that <em>One</em> and <em>Two</em> are equal to <em>Three,</em> without having heard, or thought on that, or any other Axiom, by which it might be proved; and knows it as certainly as any other Man knows, that the Whole is equal to all its Parts, or any other Maxim, and all from the same Reason of self-evidence; the Equality of those <em>Ideas,</em> being as visible and certain to him without that, or any other Axiom, as with it, it needing no proof to make it perceived. Nor after the Knowledge, <em>That the Whole is equal to all its Parts,</em> does he know that one and two are equal to three, better, or more certainly than he did before. For if there be any odds in those <em>Ideas,</em> the Whole and Parts are more obscure, or at least more difficult to be setled in the Mind, than those of <em>One, Two,</em> and <em>Three.</em> And indeed, I think, I may ask these Men, who will needs have all Knowledge besides those general principles themselves, to depend on general, innate, and self-evident Principles, What Principle is requisite to prove, that <em>One</em> and <em>One</em> are <em>Two,</em> that <em>Two</em> and <em>Two</em> are <em>Four,</em> that <em>Three</em> times <em>Two</em> are <em>Six</em>? which being known without any proof, do evince, That either all Knowledge does not depend on certain <em>Praecognita</em> or general Maxims, called Principles; or else that these are Principles: and if these are to be counted Principles, a great part of Numeration will be so. To which if we add all the self-evident Propositions, may be made about all our distinct <em>Ideas,</em> Principles will be almost infinite, at least innumerable, which Men arrive to the Knowledge of, at different Ages; and a great many of these innate Principles, they never come to know all their Lives. But whether they come in view of the Mind, earlier or later, this is true of them, that they are all known by their native Evidence, are wholly independent, receive no Light, nor are capable of any proof one from another; much less the more particular, from the more general; or the more simple, from the more compounded: the more simple, and less abstract, being the most familiar, and the easier and earlier apprehended. But whichever be the clearest <em>Ideas,</em> the Evidence and Certainty of all such Propositions is in this, That a Man sees the same <em>Idea</em> to be the same <em>Idea,</em> and infallibly perceives two different <em>Ideas</em> to be different <em>Ideas.</em> For when a Man has in his Understanding, the <em>Ideas</em> of one and of two, the <em>Idea</em> of Yellow and the <em>Idea</em> of Blue, he cannot but certainly know, that the <em>Idea</em> of One is the <em>Idea</em> of One, and not the <em>Idea</em> of Two; and that the <em>Idea</em> of Yellow is the <em>Idea</em> of Yellow, and not the <em>Idea</em> of Blue. For a Man cannot confound the <em>Ideas</em> in his Mind, which he has distinct: That would be to have them confused and distinct at the same time, which is a contradiction: And to have none distinct, is to have no use of our Faculties, to have no Knowledge at all. And therefore what <em>Idea</em> soever is affirmed of it self; or whatsoever two entire distinct <em>Ideas</em> are denied one of another, the Mind cannot but assent to such a Proposition, as infallibly true, as soon as it understands the Terms, without Hesititation or need of Proof, or regarding those made in more general Terms, and called Maxims.","subId":"10","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What shall we then say, Are these <em>general Maxims</em> of no use? Yes, they <em>are of</em> great <em>Use</em> in Disputes, <em>to stop the Mouths of Wranglers</em>; but not of much Use to the discovery of unknown Truths, or to help the Mind forwards, in its search after Knowledge. For whoever began to build his Knowledge on this general Proposition, <em>What is, is</em>: or <em>it is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be</em>; and from either of these, as from a Principle of Science, deduced a System of useful Knowledge? Wrong Opinions, often involving Contradictions, one of these Maxims, as a Touch-stone, may serve well to shew whither they lead: But yet, however fit, to lay open the Absurdity or Mistake of a Man's Reasoning or Opinion, they are of very little Use for enlightning the Understanding: And it will not be found, that the Mind receives much help from them in its Progress in Knowledge; which would be neither less, nor less certain, were these two general Propositions never thought on. 'Tis true, as I have said, they sometimes serve in Argumentation to stop a Wrangler's Mouth, by shewing the Absurdity of his Opinion. But it is one thing, to shew a Man that he is in an Error; and another, to put him in possession of Truth: and I would fain know what Truths these Propositions are able to teach; and by their Influence make us know, which we did not know before, or could not know without them. Let us reason from them, as well as we can, they are only about identical Predications, and influence, if any at all, none but such. Each particular Proposition concerning Identity or Diversity, is as clearly and certainly known in it self, if attended to, as either of these general ones: and there is nothing more certain, than that by these Maxims alone we cannot evidence to our selves the Truth of any one thing really existing. As to other less general Maxims, many of them are no more than bare verbal Propositions, and teach us nothing but the Respect and Import of Names one to another. <em>The Whole is equal to all its Parts,</em> What real Truth I beseech you does it teach us? What more is contained in that Maxim, than what the Signification of the Word <em>Totum,</em> or the Whole, does of it self import? And he that knows that the Word <em>Whole,</em> stands for what is made up of all its Parts, knows very little less, than that the <em>Whole</em> is equal to all its Parts. And upon the same ground, I think that this Proposition, <em>A Hill is higher than a Valley,</em> and several the like, may also pass for Maxims. But yet Mathematicians do not without Reason place this, and some other such, amongst their Maxims, that their Scholars, having in the entrance perfectly acquainted their Thoughts with these Propositions, made in such general Terms, may have them ready to apply to all particular Cases: not that if they be equally weighed, they are more clear and evident than the particular Instances they are brought to confirm; but that being more familiar to the Mind, the very naming them is enough to satisfie the Understanding. But this, I say, is more from our Custom of using them, than the different Evidence of the Things. But before Custom has setled Methods of Thinking and Reasoning in our Minds, I am apt to imagine it is quite otherwise: and that the Child, when a part of his Apple is taken away, knows it better in that particular Instance, than by that general Proposition, <em>The Whole is equal to all its Parts</em>; and that if one of these have need to be confirmed to him by the other, the general has more need to be let into his Mind by the particular, than the particular by the general. For in particulars, our Knowledge begins, and so spreads it self, by degrees, to generals. Though afterwards, the Mind takes the quite contrary Course, and having drawn its Knowledge into as general Propositions as it can, makes those familiar to its Thoughts, and accustoms it self to have recourse to them, as to the Standards of Truth and Falshood: by which familiar use of them, as Rules to measure the Truth of other Propositions, it comes in time to be thought, that more particular Propositions have their Truth and Evidence from their conformity to these more general ones, which in Discourse and Argumentation, are so frequently urged, and constantly admitted. And this I think to be the reason why amongst so many self-evident Propositions, the most general only have had the Title of Maxims.","subId":"11","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One thing farther, I think, it may not be amiss to observe concerning these general Maxims, That they are so far from improving or establishing our Minds in true Knowledge, that <em>if our Notions be wrong, loose, or unsteady,</em> and we resign up our Thoughts rather to the sound of Words, than to setled, clear, distinct <em>Ideas</em> of Things: I say, these <em>general Maxims, will serve to confirm us in Mistakes</em>; and in such a way of use of Words, which is most common, will serve to prove Contradictions: <em>v. g.</em> He that, with <em>Cartes,</em> shall frame in his Mind an <em>Idea</em> of what he calls <em>Body,</em> to be nothing but Extension, may easily demonstrate, that there is no <em>Vacuum; i. e.</em> no Space void of Body, by this Maxim, <em>What is, is.</em> For the <em>Idea</em> to which he annexes the name <em>Body,</em> being bare Extension, his Knowledge, that Space cannot be without Body, is certain. For he knows his own <em>Idea</em> of Extension clearly and distinctly, and knows that it is <em>what it is,</em> and not another <em>Idea,</em> though it be called by these three names, Extension, Body, Space; which three Words standing for one and the same <em>Idea,</em> may, no doubt, with the same evidence and certainty, be affirmed one of another, as each of it self: And it is as certain, that whilst I use them all to stand for one and the same <em>Idea,</em> this predication is as true and identical in its signification, that <em>Space is Body,</em> as this predication is true and identical, <em>that Body is Body,</em> both in signification and sound.","subId":"12","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But if another shall come and make to himself another <em>Idea</em> different from <em>Cartes,</em> of the thing, which yet, with <em>Cartes,</em> he calls by the same name <em>Body,</em> and make his <em>Idea,</em> which he expresses by the word <em>Body,</em> to consist of <em>Extension</em> and <em>Solidity</em> together, he will as easily demonstrate, that there may be a <em>Vacuum,</em> or Space, without a Body, as <em>Cartes</em> demonstrated the contrary, because the <em>Idea</em> to which he gives the name <em>Space,</em> being bare Extension, and the <em>Idea</em> to which he gives the name <em>Body,</em> being the complex <em>Idea</em> of Extension and Resistibility, or Solidity together; these two <em>Ideas</em> are not exactly one and the same, but in the Understanding as distinct as the <em>Ideas</em> of One and Two, White and Black, or as of <em>Corporeity</em> and <em>Humanity,</em> if I may use those barbarous terms: And therefore the predication of them in our Minds, or in Words standing for them is not identical, but the negation of them one of another, as certain and evident, as <em>that it is impossible for the same thing to be, and not to be.</em>","subId":"13","id":"Locke.EHU.4.7.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But yet though both these Propositions (as you see) may be equally demonstrated, <em>viz.</em> That there may be a <em>Vacuum,</em> and that there cannot be a <em>Vacuum,</em> by these two certain Principles, <em>(viz.)
