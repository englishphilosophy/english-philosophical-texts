X.</h1> <h2><em>Of the Abuse of Words.</em></h2> ","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"BEsides the imperfection that is naturally in Language, and the obscurity and confusion that is so hard to be avoided in the Use of Words, there are several <em>wilful Faults and Neglects,</em> which Men are guilty of, in this way of Communication, whereby they render these signs less clear and distinct in their signification, than naturally they need to be.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>First,</em> In this kind, the first and most palpable abuse is, the using of Words, without clear and distinct <em>Ideas</em>; or, which is worse, signs without any thing signified. Of these there are two sorts: I. One may observe, in all Languages, certain Words, that if they be examined, will be found, in their first Original, and their appropriated Use, not to stand for any clear and distinct <em>Ideas.</em> These, for the most part, the several <em>Sects</em> of Philosophy and Religion have introduced. For their Authors, or Promoters, either affecting something singular, and out of the way of common apprehensions, or to support some strange Opinions, or cover some Weakness of their Hypothesis, seldom fail to <em>coin</em> new Words, and such as, when they come to be examined, may justly be called <em>insignificant Terms.</em> For having either had no determinable Collection of <em>Ideas</em> annexed to them, when they were first invented; or at least such as, if well examined, will be found inconsistent, 'tis no wonder if afterwards, in the vulgar use of the same party, they remain empty Sounds, with little or no signification, amongst those who think it enough to have them often in their mouths, as the distinguishing Characters of their Church, or School, without much troubling their heads to examine, what are the precise <em>Ideas</em> they stand for. I shall not need here to heap up instances, every one's reading and conversation will sufficiently furnish him: Or if he wants to be better stored, the great Mint-Masters of these kind of Terms, I mean the Schoolmen and Metaphysicians, (under which, I think, the disputing natural and moral Philosophers of these latter Ages, may be comprehended,) have wherewithal abundantly to content him.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"II. Others there be, who extend this abuse yet farther, who take so little care to lay by Words, which in their primary notation have scarce any clear and distinct <em>Ideas</em> they are annexed to, that by an unpardonable negligence, they familiarly <em>use Words,</em> which the Propriety of Language has affixed to very important <em>Ideas,</em> they use them, I say, <em>without any distinct meaning</em> at all. <em>Wisdom, Glory, Grace,</em> &amp;c. are Words frequent enough in every Man's mouth; but if a great many of those who use them, should be asked, What they mean by them? they would be at a stand, and not know what to answer: A plain proof, that though they have learned those Sounds, and have them ready at their Tongues ends, yet there are no clear and distinct <em>Ideas</em> laid up in their Minds, which are to be expressed to others by them.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Men,</em> having been <em>accustomed</em> from their Cradles <em>to learn Words,</em> which are easily got and retained, <em>before they knew,</em> or had framed <em>the complex Ideas,</em> to which they were annexed, or which were to be found in the things <em>they</em> were thought to <em>stand</em> for, they <em>usually continue to do so</em> all their Lives, and without taking the pains necessary to settle in their Minds clear and distinct <em>Ideas,</em> they use their Words for such unsteady and confused Notions as they have, contenting themselves with the same Words other People use; as if their very sound, necessarily carried with it constantly the same meaning. This though Men make a shift with, in their ordinary Occurrences of Life, where they find it necessary to be understood, and therefore they make signs till they are so: Yet this insignificancy in their Words, when they come to Reason, concerning either their Tenents or Interest, manifestly fills their Discourse with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jargon, especially in moral Matters, where the Words, for the most part, standing for arbitrary and numerous Collections of <em>Ideas,</em> not regularly and permanently united in Nature, their bare Sounds are often only thought on, or at least very obscure and uncertain Notions annexed to them. Men take the Words they find in use amongst their Neighbours; and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for, use them confidently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning: Whereby, besides the ease of it, they obtain this advantage, That as in such Discourses they seldom are in the right, so they are as seldom to be convinced, that they are in the wrong; it being all one to go about to draw those Men out of their Mistakes, who have no setled Notions, as to dispossess a Vagrant of his Habitation, who has no setled abode: This I guess to be so; and every one may observe in himself and others, whether it be, or no.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly,</em> Another great abuse of Words is, <em>Inconstancy</em> in the use of them. It is hard to find a Discourse written of any Subject, especially of Controversie, wherein one shall not observe, if he read with attention, the same Words (and those commonly the most material in the Discourse, and upon which the Argument turns) used sometimes for one Collection of simple <em>Ideas,</em> and sometimes for another, which is a perfect abuse of Language. Words being intended for signs of my <em>Ideas,</em> to make them known to others, not by any natural signification, but by a voluntary imposition, 'tis plain cheat and abuse, when I make them stand sometimes for one thing, and sometimes for another; the wilful doing whereof, can be imputed to nothing but great folly, or greater dishonesty. And a Man, in his Accompts with another, may, with as much fairness, make the Characters of Numbers stand sometimes for one, and sometimes for another Collection of Unites: <em>v. g.</em> this Character 3, stands sometimes for three, sometimes for four, and sometimes for eight; as in his Discourse, or Reasoning, make the same Words stand for different Collections of simple <em>Ideas.</em> If Men should do so in their Reckonings, I wonder who would have to do with them? One who should speak thus, in the Affairs and Business in the World, and call 8 sometimes seven, sometimes nine, as best served his advantage, would presently have clapp'd upon him one of the two Names Men constantly are disgusted with; and yet in Arguings, and learned Contests, the same sort of proceeding passes commonly for Wit and Learning: But yet, to me, it appears a greater dishonesty, than the misplacing of Counters, in the casting up a Debt, and the cheat the greater, by how much Truth is of greater concernment and value, than Money.","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Thirdly,</em> Another abuse of Language is, an <em>affected Obscurity,</em> by either applying old Words, to new and unusual Significations; or introducing new and ambiguous Terms, without defining either; or else putting them so together, as may confound their ordinary meaning. Though the Peripatetick Philosophy has been most eminent in this way, yet other Sects have not been wholly clear of it. There is scarce any of them, that are not cumbred with some Difficulties, (such is the imperfection of Humane Knowledge,) which they have been fain to cover with Obscurity of Terms, and to confound the Signification of Words, which, like a mist before Peoples Eyes, might hinder their weak parts from being discovered. That Body and Extension, in common use, stand for two distinct <em>Ideas,</em> is plain to any one that will but reflect a little: For were their Signification precisely the same, it would be as proper, and as intelligible to say, the Body of an Extension, as the Extension of a Body; and yet there are those who find it necessary to confound their Signification. To this abuse, and the mischiefs of confounding the Signification of Words, Logick, and the liberal Sciences, as they have been handled in the Schools, have given Reputation; and the admired Art of Disputing, hath added much to the natural imperfection of Languages, whilst it has been made use of, and fitted to perplex the signification of Words, more than to discover the Knowledge and Truth of Things: And he that will look into that sort of learned Writings, will find the Words there much more obscure, uncertain, and undetermined in their Meaning, than they are in ordinary Conversation.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is unavoidably to be so, where Mens Parts and Learning, are estimated by their Skill in <em>Disputing.</em> And if Reputation and Reward shall attend these Conquests, which depend mostly on the fineness and niceties of Words, 'tis no wonder if the Wit of Man so employ'd, should perplex, involve, and subtilize the signification of Sounds, so as never to want something to say, in opposing or defending any Question; the Victory being adjusted not to him who had Truth on his side, but the last word in the Dispute.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This, though a very useless Skill, and that which I think the direct opposite to the ways of Knowledge, hath yet passed hitherto under the laudable and esteemed Names of <em>Subtility</em> and Acuteness, and has had the applause of the Schools, and encouragement of one part of the learned Men of the World; and no wonder, since the Philosophers of old, (the disputing and wrangling Philosophers I mean, such as <em>Lucian</em> wittily, and with Reason taxes,) and the Schoolmen since, aiming at Glory and Esteem, for their great and universal Knowledge, easier a great deal to be pretended to, than really acquired, found this a good Expedient to cover their Ignorance, with a curious and unexplicable Web of perplexed Words, and procure to themselves the admiration of others, by unintelligible terms; the apter to produce wonder, because they could not be understood: whilst it appears in all History, that these profound Doctors, were no wiser, nor more useful, than their Neighbours; and brought but small advantage to humane Life, or the Societies, wherein they lived: Unless the coining of new Words, where they produced no new Things to apply them to, or the perplexing or obscuring the signification of old ones, and so bringing all Things into question and dispute, were a thing profitable to the Life of Man, or worthy Commendation and Reward.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For, notwithstanding these learned Disputants, these all knowing Doctors, it was to the unscholastick Statesman, that the Governments of the World owed their Peace, Defence, and Liberties; and from the illiterate and contemned Mechanick, (a Name of Disgrace,) that they received the improvemnts of useful Arts. Nevertheless, this artificial Ignorance, and <em>learned Gibberish,</em> prevailed mightily in these last Ages, by the Interest and Artifice of those, who found no easier way to that pitch of Authority and Dominion they have attained, than by amusing the Men of Business, and Ignorant, with hard Words, or employing the Ingenious and Idle in intricate Disputes, about unintelligible Terms, and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless Labyrinth. Besides, there is no such way to gain admittance, or give defence to strange and absurd Doctrines, as to guard them round about with Legions of obscure, doubtful, and undefined Words. Which yet make these Retreats, more like the Dens of Robbers, or Holes of Foxes, than the Fortresses of fair Warriours: which if it be hard to get them out of, it is not for the strength that is in them, but the Briars and Thorns, and the Obscurity of the Thickets they are beset with.

For we see, that other well-meaning and wise Men, whose Education and Parts had not attained that accuteness, could intelligibly express themselves to one another; and in its plain use, make a benefit of Language. But though unlearned Men well enough understood the Words <em>White</em> and <em>Black, &amp;c.</em> and had constant Notions of the <em>Ideas</em> signified by those Words; yet there were Philosophers found, who had learning and subtilty enough to prove, that <em>Snow</em> was <em>black</em>; (<em>i. e.</em> to prove, that White was Black;) whereby they had the advantage to destroy the Instruments and Means of Discourse, Conversation, Instruction, and Society; whilst with great Art and Subtility, they did no more but perplex and confound the Signification of Words, and thereby render Language less useful, than the real Defects of it had made it, a Gift, which the illiterate had not attained to.","subId":"10","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These learned Men did equally instruct Mens Understandings, and profit their Lives, as he who should alter the signification of known Characters, and, by a subtile Device of Learning, far surpassing the Capacity of the Illiterate, Dull, and Vulgar, should, in his Writing, shew, that he could put <em>A.</em> for <em>B.</em> and <em>D.</em> for <em>E. &amp;c.</em> to the no small admiration and benefit of his Reader; it being as sensless to put <em>Black,</em> which is a Word agreed on to stand for one sensible <em>Idea,</em> to put it, I say, for another, or the contrary <em>Idea, i. e.</em> to call <em>Snow Black,</em> as to put this mark <em>A.</em> which is a Character agreed on to stand for one modification of Sound, made by a certain motion of the Organs of Speech, for <em>B.</em> which is agreed on to stand for another modification of Sound, made by another certain motion of the Organs of Speech.","subId":"11","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor hath this mischief stopped in logical Niceties, or curious empty Speculations; it hath invaded the great Concernments of Humane Life and Society; obscured and perplexed the material Truths of Law and Divinity; brought Confusion, Disorder, and Uncertainty into the Affairs of Mankind; and if not destroyed, yet in great measure rendred useless, those two great Rules, Religion and Justice. What have the greatest part of the Comments and Disputes, upon the Laws of GOD and Man served for, but to make the meaning more doubtful, and perplex the sense? What have been the effect of those multiplied curious Distinctions, and accute Niceties, but Obscurity and Uncertainty, leaving the Words more unintelligible, and the Reader more at a loss? How else comes it to pass, that Princes, speaking or writing to their Servants, in their ordinary Commands, are easily understood; speaking to their People, in their Laws, are not so? And, as I remarked before, doth it not often happen, that a Man of an ordinary Capacity, very well understands a Text, or a Law, that he reads, till he consults an Expositor, or goes to Council; who by that time he hath done explaining them, makes the Words signifie either nothing at all, or what he pleases.","subId":"12","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whether any by Interests of these Professions have occasioned this, I will not here examine; but I leave it to be considered, whether it would not be well for Mankind, whose concernment it is to know Things as they are, and to do what they ought; and not to spend their Lives in talking about them, or tossing Words to and fro: Whether it would not be well, I say, that the Use of Words were made plain, and direct; and that Language, which was given us for the improvement of Knowledge, and bond of Society, should not be employ'd to darken Truth, and unsettle Peoples Rights; to raise Mists, and render unintelligible both Morality and Religion?

Who is there, that has been bred up in the Peripatetick Philosophy, who does not think the Ten Names, under which are ranked the Ten Predicaments, to be exactly conformable to the Nature of Things? Who is there, of that School, that is not persuaded, that <em>substantial forms, vegetative Souls, abhorrence of a Vacuum, intentional Species,</em> &amp;c. are something real? These Words Men have learned from their very entrance upon Knowledge, and have found their Masters and Systems lay great stress upon them; and therefore they cannot quit the Opinion, that they are conformable to Nature, and are the Representations of something that really exists. The <em>Platonists</em> have their <em>Soul of the World,</em> and the <em>Epicureans</em> their <em>endeavour towards Motion,</em> in their Atoms, when at rest. There is scarce any Sect in Philosophy has not a distinct set of Terms, that others understand not. But yet this Gibberish, which in the weakness of Humane Understanding, serves so well to palliate Mens Ignorance, and cover their Errours, comes by familiar use amongst those of the same Tribe, to seem the most important part of Language, and of all others the Terms the most significant: And should <em>Aërial</em> and <em>AEtherial Vehicles</em> come once, by the prevalency of that Doctrine, to be generally received any where, no doubt those Terms would make impressions on Mens Minds, so as to establish them in the persuasion of the reality of such Things, as much as that peripatetick Forms have heretofore done.","subId":"14","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How much <em>names taken for Things,</em> are apt to <em>mislead the Understanding,</em> the attentive Reading of philosophical Writers would abundantly discover; and that, perhaps, in Words little suspected of any such misuse. I shall instance in one only, and that a very familiar one. How many intricate Disputes have there been about <em>Matter,</em> as if there were some such thing really in Nature, distinct from <em>Body,</em> as 'tis evident, the Word <em>Matter</em> stands for an <em>Idea</em> distinct from the <em>Idea</em> of Body. For if the <em>Ideas</em> these two Terms stood for, were precisely the same, they might indifferently in all Places be put one for the other: but we see, that tho' it be proper to say, There is <em>one Matter of all Bodies,</em> one cannot say, There is <em>one Body of all Matters.</em> we familiarly say, one <em>Body</em> is bigger than another, but it sounds harsh (and I think is never used) to say, one <em>Matter</em> is bigger than another. Whence comes this then? <em>Viz.</em> from hence, that though <em>Matter</em> and <em>Body</em> be not really distinct; but where-ever there is one, there is the other: Yet <em>Matter</em> and <em>Body,</em> stand for two different Conceptions, whereof the one is incomplete, and but a part of the other. For <em>Body</em> stands for a solid extended figured Substance, whereof Matter is but a partial, and more confused Conception, it seeming to me to be used for the Substance and Solidity of Body, without taking in its Extension and Figure: And therefore it is that speaking of <em>Matter,</em> we speak of it always as one, because in Truth, it expresly contains nothing but the <em>Idea</em> of a solid Substance, which is every where the same, every where uniform: And therefore we no more conceive, or speak of different Matters in the World, than we do of different Solidities; though we both conceive, and speak of different Bodies, because Extension and Figure are capable of variation. But since Solidity cannot exist without Extension, and Figure, the taking Matter to be the name of something really existing under that Precision, has no doubt produced those obscure and unintelligible Discourses and Disputes, which have filled the Heads and Books of Philosophers concerning <em>Materia Prima</em>; which Imperfection or Abuse, how far it may concern a great many other general Terms, I leave to be considered. This, I think, I may at least say, that we should have a great many fewer Disputes in the World, if Words were taken for what they are, the signs of our <em>Ideas</em> only, and not for Things themselves. For when we argue about <em>Matter,</em> or any the like Term, we truly argue only about the <em>Idea</em> we express by that Sound, whether that precise <em>Idea</em> agree to any thing really existing in Nature, or no. And if Men would tell, what <em>Ideas</em> they make their Words stand for, there could not be half that Obscurity or Wrangling, in the search or support of Truth, that there is.","subId":"15","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But whatever inconvenience follows from this mistake of Words, this, I am sure, that by constant and familiar use, they charm Men into Notions far remote from the Truth of Things. 'Twould be a hard Matter, to persuade any one, that the Words which his Father or School-Master, the Parson of the Parish, or such a Revend Doctor used, signified nothing that really existed in Nature: Which, perhaps, is <em>none of the least Causes, that Men are so hardly drawn to quit their Mistakes,</em> even in Opinions purely philosophical, and where they have no other Interest but Truth. For the Words, they have a long time been used to, remaining firm in their Minds, 'tis no wonder, that the wrong Notions annexed to them, should not be removed.","subId":"16","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Fifthly,</em> Another <em>Abuse of Words, is the setting them in the place of Things, which they do or can by no means signifie.</em> We may observe, that in the general names of Substances, whereof the nominal Essences are only known to us, when we put them into Propositions, and affirm or deny any thing about them, we do most commonly tacitly suppose, or intend, they should stand for the real Essence of a certain sort of Substances. For when a Man says Gold is malleable, he means, and would insinuate something more than this, that what I call Gold is malleable, (though truly it amounts to no more,) but would have this understood, <em>viz.</em> that Gold; <em>i. e.</em> what has the real Essence of Gold is malleable, which amounts to thus much, that Malleableness depends on, and is inseparable from the real Essence of Gold. But a Man, not knowing wherein that real Essence consists, the connexion in his Mind of Malleableness, is not truly with an Essence he knows not, but only with the sound Gold he puts for it. Thus when we say, that <em>Animal rationale</em> is, and <em>Animal implume bibes latis unguibus</em> is not a good definition of a Man; 'tis plain, we suppose the Name <em>Man</em> in this case to stand for the real Essence of a Species, and would signifie, that a <em>rational Animal</em> better described that real Essence, than <em>a two-leg'd Animal with broad Nails, and without Feathers.</em> For else, why might not <em>Plato</em> as properly make the Word, <span class=\"foreign\"><cite>greek text</cite></span>, or <em>Man,</em> stand for his complex <em>Idea,</em> made up of the <em>Ideas</em> of a Body, distinguished from others, by a certain shape and other outward appearances, as <em>Aristotle,</em> make the complex <em>Idea,</em> to which he gave the Name <span class=\"foreign\"><cite>greek text</cite></span>, or <em>Man,</em> of Body, and the Faculty of reasoning join'd together, unless the name <span class=\"foreign\"><cite>greek text</cite></span>, or <em>Man,</em> were supposed to stand for something else, than what it signifies, and the <em>Idea</em> a Man professes he would express by it?","subId":"17","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis true, the names of Substances would be much more useful, and Propositions made in them much more certain, were the real Essences of Substances, the <em>Ideas</em> in our Minds, which those Words signified. And 'tis for want of those real Essences, that our Words convey so little Knowledge or Certainty in our Discourses about them: And therefore the Mind, to remove that Imperfection as much as it can, makes them, by a secret supposition, to stand for a thing, having that real Essence, as if thereby it made some nearer approaches to it. For though the Word <em>Man</em> or <em>Gold,</em> signifie nothing truly but a complex <em>Idea</em> of Properties, united together in one sort of Substances: Yet there is scarce any Body in the use of these Words, but often supposes each of those names to stand for a thing having the real Essence, on which those Properties depend; which is so far from diminishing the Imperfection of our Words, that by a plain Abuse, it adds to it: when we would make them stand for something, which not being in our complex <em>Idea,</em> the name we use, can no ways be the sign of.","subId":"18","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This shews us the Reason, <em>Why in mixed Modes any of the</em> Ideas <em>that make the Composition of the complex one, being left out, or changed, it is allowed to be another thing,</em> i. e. <em>to be of another Species,</em> as is plain in Chance-medly, Man-slaughter, Murther, Parricide, <em>&amp;c.</em> the Reason whereof is, because the complex <em>Idea</em> signified by that name, is the real, as well as nominal Essence; and there is no secret reference of that name to any other Essence, but that. But <em>in Substances,</em> it is <em>not</em> so. For though in that called Gold, one puts into his complex <em>Idea,</em> what another leaves out; and <em>Vice Versâ</em>: yet Men do not usually think, that therefore the Species is changed: Because they secretly in their Minds refer that name, and suppose it annexed to a real immutable Essence of a thing existing, on which those Properties depend. He that adds to his complex <em>Idea</em> of Gold, that of Fixedness, or Solubility in <em>aq. regia,</em> which he put not in it before, is not thought to have changed the Species; but only to have a more perfect <em>Idea,</em> by adding another, which is always in <em>rerum natura,</em> joined with those other, of which his former complex <em>Idea</em> consisted. But this reference of the name, to a thing whereof we have not the <em>Idea,</em> is so far from helping at all, that it only serves the more to involve us in Difficulties. For by this tacit reference to the real Essence of that Species of Bodies, the Word Gold (which by standing for a more or less perfect Collection of simple <em>Ideas,</em> serves to design that sort of Body well enough in civil Discourse) comes to have no Signification at all, being put for somewhat whereof we have no <em>Idea</em> at all; and so can signifie nothing at all, when the Body it self is away. For however it may be thought all one; yet, if well considered, it will be found a quite different thing, to argue about Gold in name, and about a parcel of the Body it self, <em>v. g.</em> a piece of Leaf-Gold laid before us; though in Discourse, we are fain to substitute the name for the thing.","subId":"19","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That which, I think, very much disposes Men to substitute their names for the real Essences of Species, is the supposition before mentioned, that Nature works regularly in the Production of Things, and sets the Boundaries to each of those Species, by giving exactly the same real internal Constitution to each individual, which we rank under one general name. Whereas any one who observes their different Qualities, can hardly doubt that many of the Individuals, called by the same name, are in their internal Constitution, as different one from another, as several of those which are ranked under different specifick Names. <em>This supposition,</em> however <em>that the same precise internal Constitution goes always with the same specifick name, makes Men forward to take</em> those <em>names for the Representatives</em> of those <em>real Essences,</em> though indeed they signifie nothing but the complex <em>Ideas</em> they have in their Minds, when they use them. So that, if I may so say, signifying one thing, and being supposed for, or put in the place of another, they cannot but, in such a kind of use, cause a great deal of Uncertainty in Men's Discourses; especially in those who have throughly imbibed the Doctrine of substantial Forms, whereby they firmly imagine the several Species of Things to be determined and distinguished.","subId":"20","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But however preposterous and absurd it be, to make our names stand for <em>Ideas</em> we have not, or (which is all one) Essences that we know not, it being in effect, to make our Words the signs of nothing; yet tis evident to any one, whoever so little reflects on the use Men make of their Words, that there is nothing more familiar. When a Man asks, whether this or that thing he sees, let it be a Drill, or a monstrous <em>Foetus,</em> be a <em>Man,</em> or no; 'tis evident, the Question is not, Whether that particular thing agree to his complex <em>Idea,</em> expressed by the name <em>Man</em>: But whether it has in it the real Essence of a Species of Things, which he supposes his name Man to stand for. <em>In which way of using the names of Substances, there are these false suppositions</em> contained. <em>First,</em> That there are certain precise Essences, according to which Nature makes all particular Things, and by which they are distinguished into Species. That every thing has a real Constitution, whereby it is what it is, and on which its sensible Qualities depend, is past doubt: But I think it has been proved, that this makes not the distinction of Species, as we rank them; nor the boundaries of their names. <em>Secondly,</em> This tacitly also insinuates, as if we had <em>Ideas</em> of these proposed Essences. For to what purpose else is it, to enquire whether this or that thing have the real Essence of the Species Man, if we did not suppose that there were such a specifick Essence known? Which yet is utterly false: And therefore such Application of names, as would make them stand for <em>Ideas</em> we have not, must needs cause great disorder in Discourses and Reasonings about them, and be a great inconvenience in our Communication by Words.","subId":"21","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Sixthly,</em> There remains yet another more general, though, perhaps, less observed <em>Abuse of Words</em>; and that is, that Men having by a long and familiar use annexed to them certain <em>Ideas,</em> they are apt <em>to imagine so near and necessary a connexion between the names and the signification</em> they use in them, that they forwardly suppose one cannot but understand what their meaning is: and therefore one ought to acquiesce in the Words delivered, as if it were past doubt, that in the use of those common received sounds, the Speaker and Hearer had necessarily the same precise <em>Ideas.</em> Whence presuming, that when they have in Discourse used any Term, they have thereby, as it were, set before others the very thing they talk of. And so likewise taking the Words of others, as naturally standing for just what they themselves have been accustomed to apply them to, they never trouble themselves to explain their own, or understand clearly others meaning. From whence commonly proceeds Noise, and Wrangling, without Improvement or Information; whilst Men take Words to be the constant regular marks of agreed Notions, which in truth, are no more but the voluntary and unsteady signs of their own <em>Ideas.</em> And yet Men think it strange, if in Discourse, or (where it is often absolutely necessary) in Dispute, one sometimes asks the meaning of their Terms: Though the Arguings, one may every day observe in Conversation, make it evident, that there are few names of complex <em>Ideas,</em> which any two Men use for the same just precise Collection. 'Tis hard to name a Word, which will not be a clear instance of this. <em>Life</em> is a Term, none more familiar. Any one almost would take it for an Affront, to be asked what he meant by it. And yet if it comes in Question, whether a Plant, that lies ready formed in the Seed, have Life; whether the Embrio in an Egg before Incubation, or a Man in a Swound without Sense or Motion, be alive or no, it is easie to perceive, that a clear distinct settled <em>Idea</em> does not always accompany the Use of so known a Word, as that of <em>Life</em> is. Some gross and confused Conceptions Men indeed ordinarily have, to which they apply the common Words of their Language, and that serves them well enough in their ordinary Discourses and Affairs: but this is not sufficient for philosophical Enquiries. Knowledge and Reasoning require precise determinate <em>Ideas.</em> And though Men will not not be so importunately dull, as not to understand what others say, without demanding an explication of their Terms; nor so troublesomely critical, as to correct others in the use of the Words they receive from them; yet where Truth and Knowledge are concerned in the Case, I know not what Fault it can be to desire the explication of Words, whose Sense seems dubious: Or why a Man should be ashamed to own his Ignorance, in what Sense another Man uses his Words, since he has no other way of certainly knowing it, but by being informed. This Abuse of taking Words upon Trust, has no where spread so far, nor with so ill Effects, as amongst Men of Letters. The multiplication and obstinacy of Disputes, which has so laid waste the intellectual World, is owing to nothing more, than to this ill use of Words. For though it be generally believed, that there is great diversity of Opinions in the Volumes and Variety of Controversies, the World is distracted with; yet the most I can find, that the contending learned Men of different Parties do, in their Arguings one with another, is, that they speak different Languages. For I am apt to imagine, that when any of them quitting Terms, think upon Things, and know what they think, they think all the same. Though perhaps, what they would have, be different.","subId":"22","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To conclude this Consideration of the Imperfection, and Abuse of Language; the <em>ends of Language in our Discourse with others,</em> being chiefly these three: <em>First, To make known</em> one Man's Thoughts or <em>Ideas</em> to another. <em>Secondly,</em> To do it <em>with</em> as much ease and <em>quickness,</em> as is possible; and <em>Thirdly,</em> Thereby <em>to convey</em> the <em>Knowledge</em> of Things.

I may have <em>Ideas,</em> and not know the Names that belong to them; <em>v. g.</em> I may have the <em>Idea</em> of a Man's drinking till his Colour and Humour be altered, till his Tongue trips, and his Eyes look red, and his Feet fail him; and yet not know, that it is to be called <em>Drunkenness.</em> 3.

But the mistake is commonly in my giving a wrong name to my Conceptions; and so using Words in a different sense from other People, I am not understood, but am thought to have wrong <em>Ideas</em> of them, when I give wrong Names to them. Only if I put in my <em>Ideas</em> of mixed Modes or Relations, any inconsistent <em>Ideas</em> together, I fill my Head also with <em>Chimaeras</em>; since such <em>Ideas,</em> if well examined, cannot so much as exist in the Mind, much less any real Being, be ever denominated from them.","subId":"33","id":"Locke.EHU.3.10.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Since Wit and Fancy finds easier entertainment in the World, than dry Truth and real Knowledge, <em>figurative Speeches,</em> and allusion in Language, will hardly be admitted, as <em>an</em> imperfection or <em>abuse</em> of it.

What, and how various they are, I shall not trouble my self to take notice; the Books of Rhetorick which abound in the World, will inform those who want to be informed: Only I cannot but observe, how little the preservation and improvement of Truth and Knowledge, is the Care and Concern of Mankind; since the Arts of Fallacy are endow'd and preferred; and 'tis plain how much Men love to deceive, and be deceived, since the great Art of Deceit and Errour, Rhetorick I mean, has its established Professors, is publickly taught, and has always been had in great Reputation.
