Those <em>Modifications of any one simple</em> Idea (which as has been said, <em>I call simple Modes</em>) are as perfectly different and distinct <em>Ideas</em> in the Mind, as those of the greatest distance or contrariety. For the <em>Idea</em> of <em>Two,</em> is as distinct from <em>Three,</em> as <em>Blueness</em> from <em>Heat,</em> or either of them from any Number; and yet they are made up only of that simple <em>Idea</em> of an Unite repeated; and these Repetitions joined together, make those distinct <em>simple Modes,</em> of a <em>Dozen,</em> a <em>Gross,</em> a <em>Million.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I shall begin with the <em>simple Idea of Space.</em> I have shewed above, <em>c.</em> 4. that we get the <em>Idea</em> of Space, both by our Sight, and Touch; which, I think, is so evident, that it would be as needless, to go to prove, that Men perceive by their Sight, a distance between Bodies of different Colours, or between the parts of the same Body; as that they see Colours themselves: Nor is it less obvious, that they can do so in the Dark by Feeling and Touch.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Space considered barely in length between any two Beings, without considering any thing else between them, is called <em>distance</em>: If considered in Length, Breadth, and Thickness, I think, it may be called <em>Capacity</em>: When considered between the extremities of Matter, which fills the Capacity of Space with something solid, tangible, and movable, it is properly called <em>Extension.</em> And so Extension is an <em>Idea</em> belonging to Body only; but <em>Space</em> may, as is evident, be considered without it. At least, I think it most intelligible, and the best way to avoid Confusion, if we use the Word <em>Extension</em> for an Affection of Matter, or the distance of the Extremities of particular solid Bodies; and <em>Space</em> in the more general Signification for distance, with or without solid Matter possessing it.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Each different distance is a different Modification of Space, and <em>each</em> Idea <em>of any different distance, or Space, is a simple Mode of this</em> Idea. Men having by accustoming themselves to stated lengths of Space, which they use for measuring of other distances, as <em>a Foot, a Yard, or a Fathom, a League, or Diametre of the Earth,</em> made those <em>Ideas</em> familiar to their Thoughts, can in their Minds repeat them as often as they will, without mixing or joining to them the <em>Idea</em> of Body, or any thing else; and frame to themselves the <em>Ideas</em> of long, square, or cubick, Feet, Yards, or Fathoms, here amongst the Bodies of the Universe, or else beyond the utmost Bounds of all Bodies; and by adding these still one to another, enlarge their <em>Idea</em> of Space as much as they please. This Power of repeating, or doubling any <em>Idea</em> we have of any distance, and adding it to the former as often as we will, without being ever able to come to any stop or stint, let us enlarge it as much as we will, is that which gives us the <em>Idea</em> of <em>Immensity.</em>","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is another Modification of this <em>Idea</em> of Space, which is nothing but the Relation of the Parts of the Termination of Capacity, or Extension amongst themselves.

For besides the vast Number of different Figures, that do really exist in the coherent masses of Matter, the Stock, that the Mind has in its Power, by varying the <em>Idea</em> of Space; and thereby making still new Compositions, by repeating its own <em>Ideas,</em> and joining them as it pleases, is perfectly inexhaustible: And so it can multiply Figures <em>in&nbsp;infinitum.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For the Mind, having a Power to repeat the <em>Idea</em> of any length directly stretched out, and join it to another in the same Direction, which is to double the length of that streight Line; or else join it to another with what Inclination it thinks fit, and so make what sort of Angle it pleases: And being able also to shorten any Line it imagines, by taking from it ½ or ¼, or what part it pleases, without being able to come to an end of any such Divisions, it can make an Angle of any bigness: So also the Lines that are its sides of what length it pleases, which joining again to other Lines of different lengths, and at different Angles, till it has wholly inclosed any Space, it is evident that it can multiply <em>Figures</em> both in their Shape, and Capacity, <em>in&nbsp;infinitum,</em> all which are but so many different <em>simple Modes of Space.</em> The same that it can do with streight Lines, it can do also with crooked, or crooked and streight together; and the same it can do in Lines, it can also in Superficies, by which we may be led into farther Thoughts of the endless Variety of <em>Figures,</em> that the Mind has a Power to make, and thereby to multiply the <em>simple Modes</em> of Space.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Another <em>Idea</em> coming under this Head, and belonging to this Tribe, is that we call <em>Place.</em> As in simple Space, we consider the relation of Distance between any two Bodies, or Points; so in our <em>Idea</em> of <em>Place,</em> we consider the relation of Distance betwixt any thing, and any two or more Points, which are considered, as keeping the same distance one with another, and so considered as at rest; for when we find any thing at the same distance now, which it was Yesterday from any two or more Points, which have not since changed their distance one with another, and with which we then compared it, we say it hath kept the same <em>Place:</em> But if it hath sensibly altered its distance with either of those Points, we say it hath changed its Place: Though vulgarly speaking in the common Notion of <em>Place,</em> we do not always exactly observe the distance from precise Points; but larger Portions of sensible Objects, to which we consider the thing placed to bear Relation, and its distance, from which we have some Reason to observe.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus a Company of Chess-men, standing on the same squares of the Chess-board, where we left them, we say they are all in the <em>same Place,</em> or unmoved; though, perhaps, the Chess-board hath been in the mean time carried out of one Room into another, because we compared them only to the Parts of the Chess-board, which keep the same distance one with another. The Chess-board, we also say, is in the <em>same Place</em> it was, if it remain in the same part of the Cabin, though, perhaps, the Ship it is in, sails all the while: and the Ship is said to be in the <em>same Place,</em> supposing it kept the same distance with the Parts of the neighbouring Land; though, perhaps, the Earth hath turned round; and so both Chess-men, and Board, and Ship, have every one <em>changed Place</em> in respect of remoter Bodies, which have kept the same distance one with another. But yet the distance from certain Parts of the Board, being that which determines the place of the Chess-men; and the distance from the fixed parts of the Cabin (with which we made the Comparison) being that which determined the Place of the Chess-board; and the fixed parts of the Earth, that by which we determined the Place of the Ship, these things may be said properly to be in the <em>same Place,</em> in those respects: Though their distance from some other things, which in this matter we did not consider, being varied, they have undoubtedly <em>changed Place</em> in that respect; and we our selves shall think so, when we have occasion to compare them with those other.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But this Modification of Distance, we call <em>Place,</em> being made by Men, for their common use, that by it they might be able to design the particular Position of Things, where they had occasion for such Designation, Men consider and determine of this <em>Place,</em> by reference to those adjacent things, which best served to their present Purpose, without considering other things, which to another Purpose would better <em>determine the Place</em> of the same thing. Thus in the Chess-board, the use of the <em>Designation of</em> the <em>Place</em> of each Chess-men, being determined only within that chequer'd piece of Wood, 'twould cross that Purpose, to measure it by any thing else: But when these very Chess-men are put up in a Bag, if any one should ask, where the black King is, it would be proper to <em>determine the Place</em> by the parts of the Room it was in, and not by the Chess-board; there being another use of <em>designing the Place</em> it is now in, than when in Play it was on the Chess-board, and so must be determined by other Bodies. So if any one should ask, in what Place are the Verses, which report the Story of <em>Nisus</em> and <em>Eurialus,</em> 'twould be very improper to determine this Place, by saying, they were in such a part of the Earth, or in <em>Bodley</em>'s Library: But the right Designation of the place, would be by the parts of <em>Virgil</em>'s Works; and the proper Answer would be, That these Verses were about the middle of the Ninth Book of his <em>AEneides</em>; And that they have been always constantly in the same Place ever since <em>Virgil</em> was printed: Which is true, though the Book it self hath moved a Thousand times, the use of the <em>Idea</em> of Place here, being to know only, in what part of the Book that Story is; that so upon occasion, we may know where to find it, and have recourse to it for our use.","subId":"9","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That our <em>Idea</em> of Place, is nothing else, but such a relative Position of any thing, as I have before mentioned, I think, is plain, and will be easily admitted, when we consider, that we can have no <em>Idea</em> of the place of the Universe, though we can of all the parts of it; because beyond that, we have not the <em>Idea</em> of any fixed, distinct, particular Beings, in reference to which, we can imagine it to have any relation of distance; but all beyond it is one uniform Space or Expansion, wherein the Mind finds no variety, no marks. For to say that the World is somewhere, means no more, but that it does exist; this though a Phrase, borrowed from Place, signifying only its Existence, not Location; and when one can find out, and frame in his Mind clearly and distinctly the Place of the Universe, he will be able to tell us, whether it moves or stands still in the undistinguishable Inane of infinite Space; tho' it be true, that the Word Place, has sometimes a more confused Sense, and stands for that Space, which any Body takes up; and so the Universe is in a Place","subId":"10","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <em>Idea</em> therefore of <em>Place,</em> we have by the same means, that we get the <em>Idea</em> of Space, (whereof this is but a particular limited Consideration, <em>viz.</em> by our Sight and Touch; by either of which we receive into our Minds the <em>Ideas</em> of Extension or Distance.","subId":"11","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are some that would persuade us, that <em>Body and Extension are the same thing</em>; who either change the Signification of Words, which I would not suspect them of, they having so severely condemned the Philosophy of others, because it hath been too much placed in the uncertain meaning, or deceitful obscurity of doubtful, or insignificant Terms. It therefore they mean by <em>Body and Extension the same,</em> that other People do, <em>viz.</em> by <em>Body</em> something that is solid, and extended, whose parts are separable and movable different ways; and by Extension, only the Space that lies between the Extremities of those solid coherent Parts, and which is possessed by them, they confound very different <em>Ideas</em> one with another. For I appeal to every Man's own Thoughts, whether the <em>Idea</em> of Space be not as distinct from that of Solidity, as it is from the <em>Idea</em> of Scarlet-Colour? 'Tis true, Solidity cannot exist without Extension, neither can Scarlet Colour exist without Extension; but this hinders not, but that they are distinct <em>Ideas.</em> Many <em>Ideas</em> require others, as necessary to their Existence or Conception, which yet are very distinct <em>Ideas.</em> Motion can neither be, nor be conceived without Space; and yet Motion is not Space, nor Space Motion; Space can exist without it, and they are very distinct <em>Ideas</em>; and so, I think, are those of Space and Solidity. Solidity is so inseparable an <em>Idea</em> from Body, that upon that depends its filling of Space, its Contact, Impulse, and Communication of Motion upon Impulse. And if it be a Reason to prove, that Spirit is different from Body, because Thinking includes not the <em>Idea</em> of Extension in it; the same Reason will be as valid, I suppose, to prove, that <em>Space is not Body,</em> because it includes not the <em>Idea</em> of Solidity in it; <em>Space and Solidity</em> being <em>as distinct Ideas,</em> as Thinking and Extension, and as wholly separable in the Mind one from another: <em>Body</em> then and <em>Extension,</em> 'tis evident, are two distinct <em>Ideas</em>; for First, <em>Extension</em> includes no Solidity, nor resistence to the Motion of <em>Body,</em> as Body does. Secondly, The Parts of pure Space are inseparable one from the other; so that the Continuity cannot be separated, neither really, nor mentally. For I demand of any one, to remove any part of it from another, with which it is continued, even so much as in Thought. To divide and separate actually is, as I think, by removing the parts one from another, to make two Superficies, where before there was a Continuity: And to divide mentally, is to make in the Mind two Superficies, where before there was a Continuity, and consider them as removed one from the other; which can only be done in things considered by the Mind, as capable of being separated; and by separation, of acquiring new distinct Superficies, which they then have not, but are capable of: But neither of these ways of Separation, whether real or mental, is, as I think, compatible to pure <em>Space.</em>","subId":"12","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis true, a Man may consider so much of such a <em>Space,</em> as is answerable or commensurate to a Foot, without considering the rest; which is indeed a partial Consideration, but not so much as mental Separation, or Division; since a Man can no more mentally divide, without considering two Superficies, separate one from the other, than he can actually divide, without making two Superficies disjoin'd one from the other: But a partial consideration is not separating. A Man may consider Light in the Sun, without its Heat; or Mobility in Body without its Extension, without thinking of their separation.

If the name <em>Substance,</em> stands for three several distinct <em>Ideas,</em> they would do well to make known those distinct <em>Ideas,</em> or at least to give three distinct names to them, to prevent in so important a Notion, the Confusion and Errors, that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of so doubtful a term; which is so far from being suspected to have three distinct, that it has scarce one clear distinct signification: And if they can thus make three distinct <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Substance,</em> what hinders why another may not make a fourth?","subId":"18","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"They who first ran into the Notion of <em>Accidents,</em> as a sort of real Beings, that needed something to inhere in, were forced to find out the word <em>Substance,</em> to support them.

If he could, then he would put his Arm, where there was before <em>Space</em> without <em>Body</em>; and if there he spread his Fingers, there would still be <em>Space</em> between them without <em>Body</em>: If he could not stretch out his Hand, it must be because of some external hindrance; (for we suppose him alive, with such a power of moving the parts of his Body, that he hath now, which is not in it self impossible, if God so pleased to have it;) or at least it is not impossible for God so to move him: And then I ask, Whether that which hinders his Hand from moving outwards, be Substance or Accident, Something or Nothing?

For pure <em>Space</em> between, is sufficient to take away the necessity of mutual Contact; but bare <em>Space</em> in the way, is not sufficient to stop Motion. The truth is, these Men must either own, that they think Body infinite, though they are loth to speak it out, or else affirm, that <em>Space</em> is not <em>Body.</em> For I would fain meet with that thinking Man, that can, in his Thoughts, set any bounds to Space, more than he can to Duration; or by thinking, hope to arrive at the end of either: And therefore if his <em>Idea</em> of Eternity be infinite, so is his <em>Idea</em> of Immensity; they are both finite or infinite alike.","subId":"21","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Farther, those who assert the impossibility of <em>Space</em> existing without <em>Matter,</em> must not only make Body infinite, but must also deny a power in God to annihilate any part of Matter. No one, I suppose, will deny, that God can put an end to all motion that is in Matter, and fix all the Bodies of the Universe in a perfect quiet and rest, and continue them so as long as he pleases. Whoever then will allow, that God can, during such a general rest, annihilate either this Book, or the Body of him that reads it, must necessarily admit the possibility of a <em>Vacuum.</em> For it is evident, that the Space that was filled by the parts of the annihilated Body, will still remain, and be a Space without Body. For the circumambient Bodies being in perfect rest, are a Wall of Adamant, and in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other Body to get into that Space. And indeed the necessary motion of one Particle of Matter, into the place from whence another Particle of Matter is removed, is but a consequence from the supposition of Plenitude; which will therefore need some better proof, than a supposed matter of fact, which Experiment can never make out; our own clear and distinct <em>Ideas</em> plainly satisfying us, that there is no necessary connexion between <em>Space</em> and <em>Solidity,</em> since we can conceive the one without the other.

For they who so much alter the signification of Words, as to call <em>Extension Body,</em> and consequently make the whole Essence of Body, to be nothing but pure Extension without Solidity, must talk absurdly, whenever they speak of <em>Vacuum,</em> since it is impossible for Extension to be without Extension.

For there is not any Object of Sensation or Reflection, which does not carry with it the <em>Idea</em> of one: But the weakness of this kind of Argument, we have already shewn sufficiently.","subId":"26","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To conclude, whatever Men shall think concerning the existence of a <em>Vacuum,</em> this is plain to me, That we have as clear an <em>Idea of Space distinct from Solidity,</em> as we have of Solidity distinct from Motion, or Motion from Space. We have not any two more distinct <em>Ideas,</em> and we can as easily conceive Space without Solidity, as we can conceive Body without Motion, though it be never so certain, that neither Body nor Motion can exist without Space. But whether any one will take Space to be only a relation resulting from the Existence of other Beings at a distance; or whether they will think the Words of the most knowing King <em>Solomon, The Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens, cannot contain Thee</em>; or those more emphatical ones of the inspired Philosopher St. <em>Paul, In Him we live, move, and have our Being,</em> are to be understood in a literal sense, I leave every one to consider; only our <em>Idea</em> of <em>Space</em> is, I think, such as I have mentioned, and distinct from that of <em>Body.</em> For whether we consider in matter it self, the distance of its coherent solid parts, and call it, in respect of those solid parts, <em>Extension</em>; or whether considering it, as lying between the extremities of any Body in its several dimensions, we call it <em>Length, Breadth,</em> and <em>Thickness</em>; or else considering it as lying between any two Bodies, or positive Beings, without any consideration, whether there be any Matter or no between, we call it <em>Distance.</em> However named or considered, it is always the same uniform simple <em>Idea</em> of <em>Space,</em> taken from Objects, about which our Senses have been conversant, whereof having setled <em>Ideas</em> in our Minds, we can revive, repeat, and add them one to another as often as we will, and consider the Space or Distance so imagined, either as filled with solid parts, so that another Body cannot come there, without displacing and thrusting out the Body that was there before; or else as void of Solidity, so that a Body of equal dimensions to that empty or pure Space, may be placed in it without the removing or expulsion of any thing that was there.","subId":"27","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The knowing precisely what our Words stand for, would, I imagine, in this, as well as a great many other cases, quickly end the dispute. For I am apt to think, that Men, when they come to examine them, find their simple <em>Ideas</em> all generally to agree, though in discourse with one another, they perhaps confound one another with different Names. I¦magine, that <em>Men</em> who abstract their Thoughts, and do well examine the <em>Ideas</em> of their own Minds, <em>cannot much differ in thinking</em>; however, they may perplex themselves with words, according to the way of speaking of the several Schools, or Sects they have been bred up in: Though amongst unthinking Men, who examine not scrupulously and carefully their own <em>Ideas,</em> and strip them not from the marks Men use for them, but confound them with words, there must be endless dispute, wrangling, and jargon; especially if they be learned bookish Men, devoted to some Sect, and accustomed to the Language of it, and have learned to talk after others. But if it should happen, that any two thinking Men should really have different <em>Ideas,</em> different Notions, I do not see how they could discourse, or argue one with another. Here I must not be mistaken, to think that every floating Imagination in Mens Brains, is presently of that sort of <em>Ideas</em> I speak of. 'Tis not easie for the Mind to put off those confused Notions and Prejudices it has imbibed from Custom, Inadvertency, and common Conversation: it requires pains and assiduity to examine its <em>Ideas,</em> till it resolves them into those clear and distinct simple ones, out of which they are compounded; and to see which, amongst its simple ones, have or have not a necessary connexion and dependence one upon another: Till a Man doth this in the primary and original Notions of Things, he builds upon floating and uncertain Principles, and will often find himself at a loss.","subId":"28","id":"Locke.EHU.2.13.28"}]}
