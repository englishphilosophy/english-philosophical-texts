The text is derived from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP.

II.</h1> <h2><em>Of Simple </em>Ideas<em>.</em></h2> ","id":"Locke.EHU.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THE better to understand the Nature, Manner, and Extent of our Knowledge, one thing is carefully to be observed, concerning the <em>Ideas</em> we have; and that is, That <em>some</em> of them are <em>simple,</em> and <em>some complex.</em> Though the Qualities that affect our Senses, are, in the things themselves, so united and blended, that there is no separation, no distance between them; yet 'tis plain, the <em>Ideas</em> they produce in the Mind, enter by the Senses simple and unmixed. For though the Sight and Touch often take in from the same Object, at the same time, different <em>Ideas</em>; as a Man sees at once Motion and Colour; the Hand feels Softness and Warmth in the same piece of Wax: Yet the simple <em>Ideas</em> thus united in the same Subject, are as perfectly distinct, as those that come in by different Senses. The coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of <em>Ice,</em> being as distinct <em>Ideas</em> in the Mind, as the Smell and Whiteness of a Lily; or as the taste of Sugar, and smell of a Rose: And there is nothing can be plainer to a Man, than the clear and distinct Perception he has of those simple <em>Ideas</em>; which being each in it self uncompounded, contains in it nothing but <em>one uniform Appearance,</em> or Conception in the Mind, and is not distinguishable into different <em>Ideas.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These simple <em>Ideas,</em> the Materials of all our Knowledge, are suggested and furnished to the Mind, only by those two ways above mentioned, <em>viz. Sensation</em> and <em>Reflection.</em> When the Understanding is once stored with these simple <em>Ideas,</em> it has the Power to repeat, compare, and unite them even to an almost infinite Variety, and so can make at Pleasure new complex <em>Ideas.</em> But it is not in the Power of the most exalted Wit, or enlarged Understanding, by any quickness or variety of Thought, to <em>invent or frame one new simple</em> Idea in the Mind, not taken in by the ways before mentioned: nor can any Force of the Understanding, <em>destroy</em> those that are there. The Dominion of Man in this little World of his own Understanding, being much what the same, as it is in the great World of visible things; wherein his Power, however managed by Art and Skill, reaches no farther, than to compound and divide the Materials that are made to his Hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least Particle of new Matter, or destroying one Atome of what is already in Being. The same inability, will every one find in himself, who shall go about to fashion in his Understanding any simple <em>Idea,</em> not received in by his Senses, from external Objects, or from the Operations of his own Mind about them. I would have any one try to phansie any Taste, which had never affected his Palate; or frame the <em>Idea</em> of a Scent, he had never smelt: And when he can do this, I will also conclude, that a blind Man hath <em>Ideas</em> of Colours, and a deaf Man true distinct Notions of sounds.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is the Reason why, though we cannot believe it impossible to God, to make a Creature with other Organs, and more ways to convey into the Understanding the notice of Corporeal things, than those five, as they are usually counted, which he has given to Man: Yet I think, it is <em>not possible,</em> for any one <em>to imagine</em> any other <em>Qualities</em> in Bodies, howsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides Sounds, Tastes, Smells, visible and tangible Qualities. And had Mankind been made with but four Senses, the Qualities then, which are the Object of the Fifth Sense, had been as far from our notice, Imagination, and Conception, as now any <em>belonging to a Sixth, Seventh, or Eighth Sense,</em> can possibly be; which, whether yet some other Creatures, in some other Parts of this vast, and stupendious Universe, may not have, will be a great Presumption to deny. He that will not set himself proudly at the top of all things; but will consider the Immensity of this Fabrick, and the great variety, that is to be found in this little and inconsiderable part of it, which he has to do with, may be apt to think, that in other Mansions of it, there may be other, and different intelligent Beings, of whose Faculties, he has as little Knowledge or Apprehension, as a worm shut up in one drawer of a Cabinet, hath of the Senses or Understanding of a Man; Such Variety and Excellency, being suitable to the Wisdom and Power of the Maker. I have here followed the common Opinion of Man's having but five Senses; though, perhaps, there may be justly counted more; but either Supposition serves equally to my present Purpose.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.2.3"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Locke","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":1689,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Locke.LT1","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"First Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"First Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TG","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Two Treatises of Government","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Two Treatises of Government"},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.LT2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.LT3","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1692],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Third Letter Concerning Toleration"},{"id":"Locke.TCE","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"Some Thoughts Concerning Education","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1693],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Thoughts Concerning Education"},{"id":"Locke.RC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VRC","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity from Mr. Edwards's Reflections","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity"},{"id":"Locke.VC2","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"A Second Vindication of The Reasonableness of Christianity","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1697],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Second Vindication of Christianity"}]},{"id":"Locke.EHU","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","title":"An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding","birth":1632,"death":1704,"published":[1689],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Concerning Humane Understanding"},{"id":"Locke.EHU.2","imported":true,"title":"Book 2.
