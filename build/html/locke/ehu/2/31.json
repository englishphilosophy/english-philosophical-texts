XXXI.</h1> <h2><em>Of Adequate and Inadequate Ideas.</em></h2> ","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"OF our real <em>Ideas,</em> some are Adequate, and some are Inadequate. Those I call <em>Adequate,</em> which perfectly represent those Archetypes, which the Mind supposes them taken from; which it intends them to stand for; and to which it refers them. <em>Inadequate Ideas</em> are such, which are but a partial, or incompleat representation of those Archetypes to which they are referred. Upon which account it is plain,","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>First,</em> That <em>all our simple Ideas are adequate.</em> Because being nothing but the effects of certain Powers in Things, fitted and ordained by GOD, to produce such Sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent, and adequate to those Powers: And we are sure they agree to the reality of Things. For if Sugar produce in us the <em>Ideas</em> which we call Whiteness, and Sweetness, we are sure there is a power in Sugar to produce those <em>Ideas</em> in our Minds, or else they could not have been produced. And so each Sensation answering the Power that operates on any of our Senses, the <em>Idea</em> so produced, is a real <em>Idea,</em> (and not a fiction of the Mind,) which has no power to produce any simple <em>Idea</em>; and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple <em>Ideas</em> are adequate. 'Tis true, the Things producing in us these simple <em>Ideas,</em> are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the causes of them; but as if those <em>Ideas</em> were real Beings in them. For though Fire be call'd painful to the Touch, whereby it signified the power of producing in us the <em>Idea</em> of Pain: yet it is denominated also Light, and Hot; as if Light, and Heat, were really something in the Fire, more than a power to excite these <em>Ideas</em> in us; and therefore are called Qualities: in, or of the Fire. But these being nothing, in truth, but powers to excite such <em>Ideas</em> in us, I must, in that sense, be understood, when I speak of secundary Qualities, as being in Things; or of their <em>Ideas,</em> as being in the Objects, that excite them in us. Such ways of speaking, though accommodated to the vulgar Notions, without which, one cannot be well understood; yet truly signifie nothing, but those Powers, which are in Things, to excite certain Sensations or <em>Ideas</em> in us. Since were there no fit Organs to receive the impressions Fire makes on the Sight and Touch; nor a Mind joined to those Organs, to receive the <em>Ideas</em> of Light and Heat, by those impressions from the Fire, or the Sun, there would yet be no more Light, or Heat in the World, than there would be Pain, if there were no sensible Creature to feel it, though the Sun should continue just as it is now, and Mount <em>AEtna</em> flame higher than ever it did. Solidity, and Extension, and the termination of it, Figure, with Motion and Rest, whereof we have the <em>Ideas,</em> would be really in the World as they are, whether there were any sensible Being to perceive them, or no: And therefore those we have reason to look on, as the real modifications of Matter; and such as are the exciting Causes of all our various Sensations from Bodies. But this being an Enquiry not belonging to this place, I shall enter no farther into it, but proceed to shew what complex <em>Ideas</em> are adequate, and what not.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly,</em> Our <em>complex Ideas of Modes,</em> being voluntary Collections of simple <em>Ideas,</em> which the Mind puts together, without reference to any real Archetypes, or standing Patterns, existing any where, <em>are,</em> and cannot but be <em>adequate Ideas.</em> Because they not being intended for Copies of Things really existing, but for Archetypes made by the Mind, to rank and denominate Things by, cannot want any thing; they having each of them that combination of <em>Ideas,</em> and thereby that perfection the Mind intended they should: So that the Mind acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus by having the <em>Idea</em> of a Figure, with three sides, meeting at three Angles, I have a compleat <em>Idea,</em> wherein I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the Mind is satisfied with the perfection of this its <em>Idea,</em> is plain, in that it doe; not conceive, that any Understanding hath, or can have a more compleat or perfect <em>Idea</em> of that thing it signifies by the word Triangle, supposing it to exist, than it self has in that complex <em>Idea</em> of three Sides, and three Angles: in which is contained all that is, or can be essential to it, or necessary to compleat it, where-ever or howe-ever it exists. But in our <em>Ideas</em> of Substances, it is otherwise. For there desiring to copy Things, as they really do exist; and to represent to our selves that Constitution, on which all their Properties depend, we perceive our <em>Ideas</em> attain not that Perfection we intend: We find they still want something we should be glad were in them; and so are all inadequate. But mixed Modes and Relations, being Archetypes without Patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves, cannot but be adequate, every thing being so to it self. He that as first put together the <em>Idea</em> of Danger perceived, absence of disorder from Fear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be done, and executing of that without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger of it, had certainly in his Mind that complex <em>Idea</em> made up of that Combination: and intending it to be nothing else, but what it is; nor to have in it any other simple <em>Ideas,</em> but what it hath, it could not also but be an adequate <em>Idea</em>: and laying this up in his Memory, with the name <em>Courage</em> annexed to it, to signifie it to others, and denominate from thence any Action he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a Standard to measure and denominate Actions by, as they agreed to it. This <em>Idea</em> thus made, and laid up for a Pattern, must necessarily be adequate, being referred to nothing else but it self, nor made by any other Original, but the Good-liking and Will of him, that first made this Combination.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Indeed, another coming after, and in Conversation learning from him the word <em>Courage,</em> may make an <em>Idea,</em> to which he gives that name <em>Courage,</em> different from what the first Author applied it to, and has in his Mind, when he uses it. And in this case, if he designs, that his <em>Idea</em> in Thinking, should be conformable to the other's <em>Idea,</em> as the Name he uses in speaking, is conformable in sound to his, from whom he learned it, his <em>Idea</em> may be very wrong, and inadequate. Because in this case, making the other Man's <em>Idea</em> the pattern of his <em>Idea</em> in thinking, as the other Man's Word, or Sound, is the pattern of his in speaking, his <em>Idea</em> is so far defective and inadequate, as it is distant from the Archetype and Pattern he refers it to, and intends to express and signifie by the name he uses for it: which name he would have to be a sign of the other Man's <em>Idea,</em> (to which, in its proper use, it is primarily annexed,) and of his own, as agreeing to it: to which if his own does not exactly correspond, it is faulty and inadequate.","subId":"4","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Therefore these <em>complex Ideas of Modes,</em> when they are referred by the Mind, and intended to correspond to the <em>Ideas</em> in the Mind of some other intelligent Being, expressed by the Names, we apply to them, they <em>may be</em> very deficient, wrong, and <em>inadequate.</em> Because they agree not to that, which the Mind designs to be their Archetype, and Pattern: In which respect only, any <em>Idea</em> of Modes can be wrong, imperfect, or inadequate. And on this account, our <em>Ideas</em> of mixed Modes are the most liable to be faulty of any other: but this refers more to proper Speaking than Knowing right.","subId":"5","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Thirdly,</em> What <em>Ideas we have of Substances,</em> I have above shewed: Now those <em>Ideas</em> have in the Mind a double reference: 1. Sometimes they are referred to a supposed real Essence of each Species of Things. 2. Sometimes they are only design'd to be Pictures and Representations in the Mind, of Things that do exist, by <em>Ideas</em> that are discoverable in them. In both which ways, these Copies of their Originals, and Archetypes, <em>are</em> imperfect and <em>inadequate.</em> <em>First,</em> It is usual for Men to make the Names of Substances, stand for Things, as supposed to have certain real Essences, whereby they are of this or that Species: And Names standing for nothing but the <em>Ideas,</em> that are in Men's Minds, they must consequently refer their <em>Ideas</em> to such real Essences, as to their Archetypes. That Men (especially such as have been bred up in the Learning taught in this part of the World) do suppose certain specifick Essences of Substances, which each Individual in its several kind is made conformable to, and partakes of, is so far from needing proof, that it will be thought strange if any one should do otherwise. And thus they ordinarily apply the specifick Names, they rank particular Substances under, to Things, as distinguished by such specifick real Essences. Who is there almost, who would not take it amiss, if it should be doubted, whether he call'd himself Man, with any other meaning than as having the real Essence of a Man? And yet if you demand, what those real Essences are, 'tis plain Men are ignorant, and know them not. From whence it follows, that the <em>Ideas</em> they have in their Minds, being referred to real Essences as Archetypes which are unknown, must be so far from being adequate, that they cannot be supposed to be any representation of them at all. The complex <em>Ideas</em> we have of Substances, are, as has been shewed, certain Collections of simple <em>Ideas,</em> that have been observed or supposed constantly to exist together. But such a complex <em>Idea</em> cannot be the real Essence of any Substance: for then the Properties we discover in that Body, would depend on that complex <em>Idea,</em> and be deducible from it, and their necessary connexion with it be known; as all Properties of a Triangle depend on, and, as far as they are discoverable, are deducible from the complex <em>Idea</em> of three Lines, including a Space. But it is plain, that in our complex <em>Ideas</em> of Substances, are not contained such <em>Ideas,</em> on which all the other Qualities, that are to be found in them, do depend. The common <em>Idea</em> Men have of Iron, is a Body of a certain Colour, Weight, and Hardness; and a Property that they look on as belonging to it, is malleableness. But yet this Property has no necessary connexion with that complex <em>Idea,</em> nor any part of it: and there is no more reason to think, that malleableness depends on that Colour, Weight, and Hardness, than that that Colour, or that Weight, depends on its malleableness. And yet, though we know nothing of these real Essences, there is nothing more ordinary, than that Men should attribute the sorts of Things to such Essences. The particular parcel of Matter which makes the Ring I have on my Finger, is forwardly, by most Men, supposed to have a real Essence, whereby it is Gold; and from whence those Qualities flow, which I find in it, <em>viz.</em> its peculiar, Colour, Weight, Hardness, Fusibility, Fixedness, and change of Colour upon a slight touch of Mercury, <em>&amp;c.</em> This Essence, from which all these Properties flow, when I enquire into it, and search after it, I plainly perceive I cannot discover: the farthest I can go, is only to presume, that it being nothing but Body, its real Essence, or internal Constitution, on which these Qualities depend, can be nothing but the Figure, Size, and Connexion of its solid Parts; of neither of which, I having any distinct perception at all, I can have no <em>Idea</em> of its real Essence, which is the cause that it has that particular shining yellowness; a greater weight than any thing I know of the same bulk; and a fitness to have its Colour changed by the touch of Quicksilver. If any one will say, that the real Essence, and internal Constitution, on which these Properties depend, is not the Figure, Size, and Arangement or Connexion of its solid Parts, but something else, call'd its particular form; I am farther from having any <em>Idea</em> of its real Essence, than I was before. For I have an <em>Idea</em> of Figure, Size, and Situation of solid Parts in general, though I have none of the particular Figure, Size, or putting together of Parts, whereby the Qualities above-mentioned are produced; which Qualities I find in that particular parcel of Matter that is on my Finger, and not in another parcel of Matter with which I cut the Pen I write with. But when I am told, that something besides the Figure, Size, and Posture of the solid Parts of that Body, is its Essence, something called substantial form, of that, I confess, I have no <em>Idea</em> at all, but only of the sound <em>Form</em>: which is far enough from an <em>Idea</em> of its real Essence, or Constitution. The like ignorance as I have of the real Essence of this particular Substance, I have also of the real Essence of all other natural ones: Of which Essences, I confess, I have no distinct <em>Ideas</em> at all; and I am apt to suppose, others, when they examine their own Knowledge, will find in themselves, in this one point, the same sort of ignorance.","subId":"6","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now then, when Men apply to this particular parcel of Matter on my Finger, a general Name already in use, and denominate it <em>Gold,</em> Do they not ordinarily, or are they not understood to give it that Name, as belonging to a particular Species of Bodies, having a real internal Essence; by having of which Essence, this particular Substance comes to be of that Species, and to be called by that Name? If it be so, as it is plain it is, the name by which Things are marked, as having that Essence, must be referred primarily to that Essence; and consequently the <em>Idea</em> to which that name is given, must be referred also to that Essence, and be intended to represent it: which Essence, since they who so use the Names, know not their <em>Ideas of Substances</em> must be <em>all inadequate</em> in that respect, as not containing in them that real Essence, which the Mind intends they should.","subId":"7","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Secondly,</em> Those who, neglecting that useless Supposition of unknown real Essences, whereby they are distinguished, endeavour to copy the Substances, that exist in the World, by putting together the <em>Ideas</em> of those sensible Qualities, which are sound co-existing in them, though they come much nearer a likeness of them, than those who imagine they know not what real specifick Essences: yet they arrive not at perfectly adequate <em>Ideas</em> of those Substances, they would thus copy into their Minds: nor do those Copies, exactly and fully, contain all that is to be found in their Archetypes. Because those Qualities, and Powers, of Substances, whereof we make their complex <em>Ideas,</em> are so many and various, that no Man's complex <em>Idea</em> contains them all. That our abstract <em>Ideas</em> of Substances, do not contain in them all the simple <em>Ideas</em> that are united in the Things themselves, is evident, in that Men do rarely put into their complex <em>Idea</em> of any Substance, all the simple <em>Ideas</em> they do know to exist in it. Because endeavouring to make the signification of their specifick Names, as clear, and as little cumbersome as they can, they make their specifick <em>Ideas</em> of the sorts of Substances, for the most part, of a few of those simple <em>Ideas</em> which are to be found in them: But these having no original precedency, or right to be put in, and make the specifick <em>Idea,</em> more than others that are left out, 'tis plain that both these ways, <em>our Ideas of Substances</em> are deficient, and <em>inadequate.</em> The simple <em>Ideas</em> whereof we make our complex ones of Substances, are all of them (baring only the Figure and Bulk of some sorts) Powers; which being Relations to other Substances, we can never be sure we know all the Powers that are in any one Body, till we have tried what Changes it is fitted to give to, or receive from other Substances, in their several ways of application: which being impossible to be tried upon any one Body, much less upon all, it is impossible we should have adequate <em>Ideas</em> of any Substance, made up of a Collection of all its Properties.","subId":"8","id":"Locke.EHU.2.31.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whosoever first light on a parcel of that sort of Substance, we denote by the word <em>Gold,</em> could not rationally take the Bulk and Figure he observed in that lump, to depend on its real Essence; on its internal Constitution.

Which both are but Powers; the one to affect our Eyes, after such a manner, and to produce in us that <em>Idea</em> we call Yellow; and the other to force upwards any other Body of equal bulk, they being put into a pair of equal Scales, one against another. Another, perhaps, added to these, the <em>Ideas</em> of Fusibility and Fixedness, two other passive Powers, in relation to the operation of Fire upon it: Another, its Ductility and Solubility in <em>Aq. Regia,</em> two other Powers, relating to the operation of other Bodies, in changing its outward Figure, or Separation of it, into sensible Parts.

The changes that that one Body is apt to receive, and make in other Bodies, upon a due application, exceeding far, not only what we know, but what we are apt to imagine.
