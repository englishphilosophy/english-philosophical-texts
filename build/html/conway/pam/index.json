It was then translated from the Latin back into English, and published in 1692 in London. As the original manuscript sadly does not survive, we have no option but to take this third-hand 1692 version as our copytext. Our general principle on this site is to include only works originally published in the author’s own English, but the unusual history of this work seemed to merit making an exception.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A34395.0001.001?view=toc","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"<h4>THE</h4> <h1>PRINCIPLES</h1> <h4>Of the most Ancient and Modern</h4> <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2> <h6>CONCERNING</h6> <em>God</em>, <em>Christ</em>, and the <em>Creatures</em>, viz. of Spirit and Matter in general, whereby may be resolved all those Problems or Difficulties, which neither by the School nor Common Modern Philosophy, nor by the <em>Cartesian</em>, <em>Hobbesian</em>, or <em>Spinosian</em> could be discussed. <h6>BEING</h6> A little Treatise published since the Author's Death, translated out of the <em>English</em> into <em>Latin</em>, with Annotations taken, from the Ancient Philosophy of the <em>Hebrews</em>; and now again made <em>English</em>.","id":"Conway.PAM"}],"texts":[{"id":"Conway.PAM.1","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 1","breadcrumb":"Chapter 1","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.Ann","imported":true,"title":"Annotations on Chapter 1","breadcrumb":"Annotations on Chapter 1","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.2","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 2","breadcrumb":"Chapter 2","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.3","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 3","breadcrumb":"Chapter 3","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.4","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 4","breadcrumb":"Chapter 4","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.5","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 5","breadcrumb":"Chapter 5","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.6","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 6","breadcrumb":"Chapter 6","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.7","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 7","breadcrumb":"Chapter 7","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.8","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 8","breadcrumb":"Chapter 8","published":[1690]},{"id":"Conway.PAM.9","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 9","breadcrumb":"Chapter 9","published":[1690]}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Conway","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":1692,"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","texts":[{"id":"Conway.PAM","forename":"Anne","surname":"Conway","title":"The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy","birth":1631,"death":1679,"published":[1690],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Principles of Ancient and Modern Philosophy"}]}]}
