In 1714, he published the poem again, together with a preface, <em>An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue</em>, and several <em>Remarks</em> on the poem, all under the title of <em>The Fable of the Bees</em>. Our copytext is the 3rd edition of 1724, to which two additional essays were added. The text here derives from F. B.
