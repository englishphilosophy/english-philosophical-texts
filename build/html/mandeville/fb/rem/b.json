To pass by the innumerable Artifices, by which Buyers and Sellers out-wit one another, that are daily allowed of and practised among the fairest of <em>Dealers,</em> shew me the <em>Tradesman</em> that has always discover'd the Defects of his Goods to those that cheapen'd them; nay, where will you find one that has not at one time or other industriously conceal'd them, to the detriment of the <em>Buyer?</em> Where is the Merchant that has never against his Conscience extoll'd his Wares beyond their Worth, to make them go off the better?","subId":"1","id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem.B.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Decio,</em> a Man of great Figure, that had large Commissions for Sugar from several Parts beyond Sea, treats about a considerable parcel of that Commodity with <em>Alcander</em> an eminent <em>West-India</em> Merchant; both understood the Market very well, but could not agree: <em>Decio</em> was a Man of Substance, and thought no body ought to buy cheaper than himself; <em>Alcander</em> was the same, and not wanting Money, stood for his Price. While they were driving their Bargain at a Tavern near the <em>Exchange, Alcander</em>'s Man brought his Master a Letter from the <em>West-Indies,</em> that inform'd him of a much greater quantity of Sugars coming for <em>England</em> than was expected. <em>Alcander</em> now wish'd for nothing more than to sell at <em>Decio</em>'s Price, before the News was publick; but being a cunning Fox, that he might not seem too precipitant, nor yet lose his Customer, he drops the Discourse they were upon, and putting on a Jovial Humour, commends the Agreeableness of the Weather, from whence falling upon the Delight he took in his Gardens, invites <em>Decio</em> to go along with him to his Country-House, that was not above Twelve Miles from <em>London.</em> It was in the Month of <em>May,</em> and, as it happened, upon a <em>Saturday</em> in the Afternoon: <em>Decio,</em> who was a single Man, and would have no Business in Town before <em>Tuesday,</em> accepts of the other's Civility, and away they go in <em>Alcander</em>'s Coach. <em>Decio</em> was splendidly entertain'd that Night and the Day following; the <em>Monday</em> Morning, to get himself an Appetite, he goes to take the Air upon a Pad of <em>Alcander</em>'s, and coming back meets with a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, who tells him News was come the Night before that the <em>Barbadoes</em> Fleet was destroy'd by a Storm, and adds, that before he came out it had been confirm'd at <em>Lloyd</em>'s Coffee-House, where it was thought Sugars would rise 25 <em>per Cent.</em> by Change-time. <em>Decio</em> returns to his Friend, and immediately resumes the Discourse they had broke off at the Tavern: <em>Alcander</em>, who thinking himself sure of his Chap, did not design to have moved it till after Dinner, was very glad to see himself so happily prev-ented ; but how desirous soever he was to sell, the other was yet more eager to buy; yet both of them afraid of one another, for a considerable time counterfeited all the Indifference imaginable; 'till at last <em>Decio</em> fired with what he had heard, thought Delays might prove dangerous, and throwing a Guinea upon the Table, struck the Bargain at <em>Alcander</em>'s Price. The next Day they went to <em>London;</em> the News prov'd true, and <em>Decio</em> got Five Hundred Pounds by his Sugars. <em>Alcander,</em> whilst he had strove to over-reach the other, was paid in his own Coin: yet all this is called fair dealing; but I am sure neither of them would have desired to be done by, as they did to each other.","subId":"2","id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem.B.2"}]}
