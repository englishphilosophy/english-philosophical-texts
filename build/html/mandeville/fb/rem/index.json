In 1714, he published the poem again, together with a preface, <em>An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue</em>, and several <em>Remarks</em> on the poem, all under the title of <em>The Fable of the Bees</em>. Our copytext is the 3rd edition of 1724, to which two additional essays were added. The text here derives from F. B. Kaye's edition (Liberty Fund), as published on the Online Library of Liberty.","sourceUrl":"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/mandeville-the-fable-of-the-bees-or-private-vices-publick-benefits-vol-1","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"<h1>Remarks</h1> ","id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem"}],"texts":[{"id":"Mandeville.FB.Rem.A","imported":true,"title":"(A.)
