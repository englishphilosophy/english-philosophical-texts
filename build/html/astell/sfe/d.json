how vain are their attempts, when they meet such awful goodness as your Husband was master of, whose looks and Character discouraged all appearances of vice, too much to admit a second attack, from those Vultures that are indeed fit for no places but Charnel houses, where all things are as corrupted and rotten as their Principles, and yet these Monsters are too too often received into the noblest Palaces, where that their deformities may not be observed; they take care to render their Proselytes, as odious and infectious as themselves, and so joyn together to spread the dreadful Contagion, as far as their acquaintance reaches; had your dear Husband fall'n a prey to them, he had been lost for ever to you, and to himself; but now, tho his change must of necessity give you a very great trouble, for being deprived of the best Companion, and the truest Friend that ever any woman was made happy by, yet after a due debt paid to his memory, which I know can be diverted by nothing upon Earth, I hope that trouble will find the most comfortable allay in the consideration, that this parting is to his unexpressable advantage, and has removed him from a transitory and imperfect, to an Everlasting happiness, whither I doubt not you are daily preparing to follow him; and since it has pleased God to deny you the further assistance of such an Example and Counsellor, to strengthen you in your Travel, he will abundantly recompense that loss, by allowing you a greater measure of his, to carry you thorough the tryals and temptations to which you are exposed by the way, unless you neglect to implore his help by giving up your self to a Melancholy, that must needs discompose all your faculties at the same time, weakning your body, and unhinging your mind; which fruitless grief, if the Saints in Heaven have a sense of what passes here below, would be more disapproved by him, whose disease is the occasion of it, then by any of your surviving friends; and were it possible by your tears to recal him for one minute, from that Scene of Glory, which he is now (as we reasonably imagin) translated into, he must regard you as his bitterest Enemy, to interrupt him in that state of Joy, which tongue cannot express, nor can it enter into the heart of Man to conceive; but if he is capable of making any wishes concerning you, we may conclude from his last words, that they all tend only to your attaining a firmer Title, to the Love and Knowledge of our Creator, that you may injoy a settled peace in your mind, and so resign up your self to the will of God, in this Gloomy providence, that your dear Spouse and you may hereafter dwell together, in that state of pleasures that has no end nor interruption; and tho the time of the afflicted seems most tedious, yet they have the consolation to know that the miseries of this world must have an end, and so must our Mourning too, and this I have learnt even from the Heathens, that all violent pains are short, and all lasting pains, are lightsome; and from hence concluded that any sort of pain might easily be endur'd, whether it were this argument, or self-love that made them bear the loss of friends with such indifference, I will not presume to determine; but I have met with some such heathenish people, whose excessive tenderness to their own persons has prevented their grieving for any others; now when their easiness in this case proceeds from that Principle, I fear it will hardly come under the name of vertue, but ill nature; for we are commanded to love our Neighbours as our selves, and none can lose the thing they love without regret, which regret when it is for a friend, or those that are nearly allyed to us, I hope is inoffensive, and God who in mercy overlooks many of our infirmities, will (I trust) pity and pardon this, which is the most natural of them all, at least if it does not transport us beyond moderation, but for those Christian Stoicks I last mentioned, their tranquility is not more assured for a less share of humane gratitude, or natural affection, since I never observed any of them without a darling passion, which affects them as tenderly, tho not so commendably as the other; in some Coveteousness and in others Pride, supplies the place of Friendship, which as it chears them when they find success, so every disappointment torments and grieves their Spirits, as much as the Death of our dearest friends does ours; and as mankind is the most excellent of all created beings upon Earth, I think it is undisputable that the degree of Love, which the supream Lord of all things is pleased to spare from himself, is much nobler imployed in kindness to one another, then in doting upon the unnecessary treasures, or the vain Ornaments of this Life, that take up most of the time and wishes of them, whose humor cannot be moved by any other spring. I grant that we ought not to expect any solid comfort from any of the Injoyments which we meet with here below, that the dearest friends must unavoidably part, and we know not whose turn it will be to be left behind; for as we came not into this world together, so we must not think to go together to the next, and tho we are permitted to Love, and commanded according to our Ability to assist each other, in this wearisom Pilgrimage, yet when it pleases God to part us, we must yeild to this common fate, notwithstanding the hardship it seems to put upon us; and whilst we do injoy the Conversation of our friends, we should prize the Goodness more then the outward Qualifications of those with whom we converse, still remembring they came not hither to do ours, but our Master's business; who making no further use of their service, in infinite Compassion, releases them from all the toils and restless cares, with which flesh and blood is howerly incompassed; accordingly in paying our last offices to the dead, the Church teaches us to say, <em>For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God, in his great mercy to take to himself the Soul of our dear Brother here departed,</em> &amp;c. By that acknowledging that Death is an effect of God's great mercy, to all such to whom the following Text may be applyed, <em>Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their Labours</em>; And if the Dissolution of the Righteous, is to exempt them from Labours, tho our own interest makes us eager to detain them longer with us; yet the sense of what they enjoy in Heaven, and the Inconveniences that attends them, whilst they are upon the Earth, must be a great means to silence our repinings; and to abate our grief: some indeed have so little peace and satisfaction, during their stay amongst us, that themselves are ready to say with <em>Job, Wherefore is light given to him that is in Misery, and Life unto the bitter in Soul, which long for Death, but it cometh not, and dig for it, more then for hid treasures, which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the Grave.</em> In such extremities, surely those that love them best, can bid them most chearfully adieu, hoping that all their sufferings are ended with their lives, and having patiently indured their Heavenly Fathers Correction, shall now be received into his Joy; were it not for this blessed Expectation, the Servants of God would commonly be most wretched, since their Cup is often empty, and as often filled with an unpleasant Potion; whilst their ungodly Neighbours have plentiousness of Rivers to drink, but tho we grieve the less for the Death of an unfortunate Friend, yet his misfortunes make us grieve the more for him, whilst he lives; a certain Demonstration that the days of man are evil, as well as few, since Friendship, the most substantial pleasure in the world, only gives us the trouble of lamenting the unhappy Life, or bewailing the untimely Death of those we love: if our life then is constantly attended with such perplexity, why should we be so apprehensive of our Death; and yet, except those few that are extraordinarily harras'd, the rest of us are as zealous to hug our chains; as if we dissembled when we complained of bondage, like the old man in the Fable, tho groaning under the burthen, yet we desire to bear it longer, rather then have the fatal sisters cut the thread. 'Tis true, we are told, that this aversion to Death is natural, since all Animals that have sense enough to foresee their danger, indeavour to avoid it; whether it is an instinct in nature which teaches them to flye from pain and oppression, or the fear of Annihilation, is beyond my reach, but we know when their breath is gone, they have no further being, and if we were Animals like them, we might have the like Apprehensions too, but now the sting of Death is taken away from us, by the blood of our Redeemer, who graciously opens the Door of Life, to all such as patiently wait till their change shall come; and piously strive in the mean time to make their change happy; for which reason we ought neither to be discontented to live, nor unwillling to dye; and tho we must feel pain, sickness, and whatsoever else we term misfortunes, with the same senses that others do (for Religion humbles, but does not stupify) yet the knowledge that we have deserved much more stripes from our great Judge, must make us resolve to lay our hands upon our mouths, and our mouths in the dust; not being able to offer one word in our own justification, but must say with the Publican God be merciful to me a sinner; and when we have according to our Duties prostrated our Souls before him, resigning our selves, and all that is dear to us, to his most wise disposal; let us in Gods Name rise up chearfully and make our own way to Heaven, looking up to Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith, and to the Examples of those blessed Saints that have gone before us, in which number you have reason to think, your dear husband deserves a place; and therefore give me leave to tell you, you are very much in the wrong, in permitting your tears to flow upon the reflection of his Accomplishments, which he is now, (and not till now) receiving the reward of; and since he has been faithful in improving those gifts, that God indued him with, and as far as Man could do, has answer'd the Character, which <em>David</em> in the fifteenth <em>Psalm</em> gives of him that shall rest upon the Holy hill, as you cannot envy, so I hope, you will not lament his proportion, nor grieve so excessively for his Death, which exalts him to such a pitch of honour; and as you always thought it your happiness to have him easy whilst he was with you endeavour at least) to show for his sake, you can submit to have him so without you; Your most flattering hopes could promise you the injoyment of him but a very little longer, and if it were in your choice, whether you would live five years with so good an husband, or ten years with a worse, I know you would chuse the former; and now since God has been so gracious, not only to give you a Man that exceeded your wishes▪ but let you pass thrice that number of years, in mutual Love without the least disgust; you must not spend all the remainder of your time, in thinking upon what you have lost; but consider how very few women are so blest at all, and of those few how seldom their happiness lasts so long as yours has done; so it pleaseth our heavenly father to order it, that he may draw us by afflictions nearer to himself, and never continueth in one stay; being therefore we are so fully convinced of the vicissitudes of this Life, let us receive every alteration with such a steddiness of mind, as becomes the Servants of God, who has promised to lay no more upon us, then he will inable us to bear, as I hope you will experience that mercy, to assist you in this tryal of your faith and patience; and that you may find no decay, no want of either, is the hearty prayer of Yours.","subId":"1","id":"Astell.SFE.D.1"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Astell","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":1694,"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","texts":[{"id":"Astell.SPL","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1694],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Serious Proposal to the Ladies"},{"id":"Astell.LLG","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"Letters Concerning the Love of God, Between the Author of the Proposal to the Ladies and Mr. John Norris","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1695],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true,"duplicate":"Norris.LLG","breadcrumb":"Letters Concerning the Love of God"},{"id":"Astell.SFE","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"Six Familiar Essays","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1696],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Six Familiar Essays"},{"id":"Astell.SP2","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part II","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1697],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","breadcrumb":"Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part 2"},{"id":"Astell.RM","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"Reflections Upon Marriage","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1700],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Reflections Upon Marriage"},{"id":"Astell.ECR","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"An Impartial Enquiry into the Causes of Rebellion and Civil War","birth":1666,"death":1731,"published":[1704],"nationality":"English","sex":"Female","breadcrumb":"Enquiry into the Causes of Rebellion"},{"id":"Astell.MTS","forename":"Mary","surname":"Astell","title":"Moderation Truly Stated;
