They accordingly distinguish a Religious, from a Moral Man; and carry their Zeal for the Doctrinal Part of Religion so far, that they seem to lay little Stress on the Performance of those Vertues recommended by our Saviour Christ, as the Way to Eternal Life; Which Vertues, have been commonly enough term'd <em>Splendid Vices</em>, in those they account not true Believers; And the Books writ by others, to recommend the Practice of them to the World, are look'd upon by these Men, as little more worthy of a Christian's Perusal, as such, than Histories or Maxims of humane Prudence.","subId":"2","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But others there are, who do not in this manner undervalue Morality, that yet perhaps are not less injurious to it; Whilst they strain the Duties of it to an impracticable Pitch; or pretend to ascend by it to something beyond, or above it: Which has been mightily the Fault of those in the Church of <em>Rome</em>; Who having a better Relish of Religion, than to be satisfied with one consisting of nothing but idle, superstitious, and pompous Shows, have betaken themselves to that which they call the inward Way, or Life of Contemplation: Of which, there never has wanted great Numbers in that Church, known in several times by several Names, which distinguish'd them more than their Opinions.

And by these, who suppose themselves thus far advanced, <em>the Use of Reasoning, and internal Discourse, tending to fix our Affections upon God, and expressing it self in sensible Devotion; and even outward Acts of Obedience to God's Will, are look'd upon as parts of the active Life, and less perfect State of a Christian;</em> as may be seen in divers Books which treat of this Matter, and particularly in <em>Santa Sophia, Treat.</em> 1st. <em>Ch.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 3.

For as the Bishop of <em>Worcester</em> (in his Fanaticism of the Roman Church) says very well: <em>If once an unintelligible Way of Practical Religion become the Standard of Devotion, no Men of Sense and Reason will ever set themselves about it; but leave it to be understood by mad Men, and practis'd by Fools.</em> Which is a Reflection that it were to be wish'd all would make, who may be tempted by Affectation of Novelty, Fondness of an Hypothesis, or any other better Reason, to build their Practical and Devotional Discourses upon Principles which not only will not bear the Test, but which oblige them to lay down such Assertions in Morality, as sober and well disposed Christians cannot understand to be practicable: Than which, I think there never was any more evidently so, than that Mankind are obliged strictly, as their Duty, to love with Desire, nothing but God only; Every Degree of Desire of any Creature whatsoever, being Sin. This Assertion, though not altogether new, yet has been but lately brought into our Pulpits, and been pretended to be set on Foot upon a Philosophical, or Natural Ground, <em>viz.</em> <em>That God, not the Creature, is the </em>immediate<em>, efficient Cause of our Sensations: For whatever gives us Pleasure </em>(say they who hold this Hypothesis)<em> has a right to our Love; but God only gives us Pleasure, therefore he only has a right to our Love.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Indeed, in a Sermon upon this Subject, <em>Matt.</em> xxij. 37. the Author pretends to establish his Sense of the Words upon a double Basis. 1. <em>That God is the only Cause of our Love.</em> 2. <em>That he is also the only proper Object of it.</em> But in Reference to the first, he does no more to this Purpose, but prove what (plainly express'd) cannot be contested; <em>viz.</em> That we receive the Power which we have of Desiring, from God: And then asks himself several Questions, as, <em>Can God act for a Creature? Does not God make all things for himself?</em> &amp;c. Which amount only to thus much, that they signifie it is his Opinion, that God (who doubtless made all things for himself) because his own Glory was his primary End in creating all things, had not therefore Secondary, and intermediate Ends for which he made the Creatures to operate one upon another: Which is but in a tacit Way to beg the Question. But he confesses rightly, that the Stress of this Business lies in the Proof of the second Proposition. <em>Upon this Hinge </em>(says he)<em> the whole Weight of the Theory turns</em>, viz. That God is the only proper Object of our Love, as being the only Cause of all our pleasing Sensations; the Creatures having no Efficiency at all to operate upon us; they being only occasional Causes of those Sentiments which God produces in us. And on this Foundation it then is, that he asserts, that every Act that carries our Desires towards the Creature is sinful: Which Opinion if receiv'd, and follow'd, must necessarily bring in the like unintelligible Way of Practical Religion, which the Bishop of <em>Worcester</em> has justly censured in the Church of <em>Rome</em>.","subId":"6","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But however perswaded, either the Author himself, or this great Assertor of this Hypothesis are of its Truth, or Reasonableness; As there was no need at all of interesting Religion, and Morality, in the Matter; so it is also very unserviceable to them; Since that which they would inferr from it is manifestly no just Consequence, any more than a useful, or practicable Doctrine. And a Man that had not been mighty fond of an Hypothesis, would never have attempted from the Pulpit, to fortifie by Scripture, an Opinion so opposite to the Tenour of it; as well as to that Morality which has been so excellently preach'd to the World by the Divines of his own Church: Whose Discourses are generally, if not universally, founded upon this Supposition; (or at least imply it) that there may be a lawful Love of the Creatures: And being herein conform'd to right Reason, and consequently adapted to humane Life, they have helped to make some Opposition to that Irreligion, which by looseness of Manners on the one hand, and uncharitable Zeal on the other, has spread it self amongst us in this last Age; But must doubtless have prevailed further, had not more reasonable Principles of Morality been inculcated into Men, than can be grounded upon seeing all things in God, <em>&amp;c.</em>","subId":"7","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For apparently, if the practical Duties of Religion had not been better accounted for, and inforc'd, than by the so much boasted of spiritual Books of the Roman Church, Religion and Vertue had before this time been disputed, or ridicul'd, out of our World.

This Duty is indeed so fully express'd herein, that we cannot conceive any Addition could be made to the Perfection of this Precept by our Blessed Saviour; Who came to teach us the whole Will of the Father, and to give us the most perfect Rule of Life that had yet been delivered to Mankind; and accordingly, <em>Luke</em> the <em>4th. ch. v.</em> 25. being asked, <em>Master what shall I do to inherit Eternal Life?</em> He said, <em>How readest thou in the Law?</em> It being answer'd, <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength; and thy Neighbour as thy self</em>: He replied, <em>Thou hast answer'd right; This do, and thou shalt live.</em> He had answer'd right, in joining together these two Commandments in the Law, <em>on which all the rest of the Law and Prophets did depend</em>, Matt. xxij. 40. And our Saviour assures him the Rule of the Law was in neither part short, or defective: For he says, <em>This do, and thou shalt live</em>. We are here taught, that the Love of God, and of our Neighbour, comprises the whole of our Duty: And accordingly we are else-where also told, <em>That Love is the fullfilling of the Law</em>.

But there appears no Ground from the Text here, to affirm that the Command of loving their Neighbour as themselves, was (as he says it was) <em>not only an absolute Measure, but a relative Character put in on purpose to distinguish it from their Love of God, Page</em> 165. of his Philosophical and Divine Letters: Unless that <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N.</em></span> will say, that the Words necessarily imply so much; which is to beg the thing he contests for, and not to prove it.","subId":"11","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Moses</em> speaking as a Law-giver, to a Multitude that did not much refine in their Speculations, or distinguish things with Philosophical Niceness, seems very plainly by this Text (as the foregoing ones make it evident) to design only to tell them how far the Love of their Neighbour ought to extend: As not only to the doing no Injury (specified in sundry Instances) but even to the <em>bearing no Grudge;</em> And (Finally says he) <em>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</em> That is, do him as little Harm, and as much Good, as thou desirest should be done to thy self. Whether, or no, he should be the Object of Desire, is not determined by this Precept, any farther than as Love naturally draws Desire after it. But against the Lawfulness of any Creature's being desired by us, it is said by <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N</em>.</span> <em>That as we cannot love God with a Love of Benevolence, he wanting nothing to be wished to his Perfection, and Happiness; so we ought not to love the Creature with a Love of Desire, they being uncapable to make any part of our Happiness.</em> What we cannot do, we are certain we shall not: And we need little Caution, not to desire what is not desirable, or (which is here equivalent) not pleasing to us. But though Men may possibly (in the Ignorance they are in of their own Being, and the Constitution of other things, with their mutual Relations) mistake, that which can make them finally happy; yet none can be supposed not to know what, at the present, pleases them; which is the Happiness, or Pleasure here intended. How little it signifies to this Matter (though the Stress of the Assertion lies in it) to say, That <em>sensible Objects are not the efficient, but occasional Causes of our pleasing Sensations,</em> will soon be consider'd. But if when we use the Word <em>Love,</em> we reflected what it is we mean by it, we should perhaps be more inlighten'd than by <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N</em></span>'s Definition of it, and should learn to distinguish better, than to call different Passions by the same Name; or confound Love, with whatever is a Concomitant of it.","subId":"12","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When I say that I love my Child, or my Friend, I find that my Meaning is, that they are things I am delighted in; Their Being is a Pleasure to me.","subId":"13","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When I say that I love God above all, I find I would express that he is my chiefest Good, and I delight in him above all things.","subId":"14","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Again, when I say that I love my self, I likewise mean by it that my Being is dear, and pleasing to me. To say one loves a thing, and that it is that which one has Complaisency in, is just the same: Love being only a Name given to that Disposition, or Act of the Mind, we find in our selves towards any thing we are pleas'd with; And so far as it is simply Love, consists barely in That; and cannot be distinguish'd into different Acts of wishing well, and desiring; which are other different Acts of the Mind, consequential to Love, according to the difference of the Object. To intelligent Beings that we love, our Love is follow'd with acts of Benevolence, or wishing well to the Being, and Happiness of that thing that helps to make us happy; and with desire of injoying that in them that delights us: And our Love to Inanimate things is follow'd with Benevolence and Well wishing to their Being, if it may be continued with their Injoyment; and with desire also of injoying them. But, because Benevolence appears most in Wishing Happiness to Beings capable of it; And the use of most Inanimate things which we love and desire to injoy, destroys them in the Injoyment; Therefore Learned Men have talk'd as if there were two sorts of Love Whereas Love is but one simple act of the Mind, always accompanied with Desire, and Benevolence too, where the Object is capable of it. But as that Definition which <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N.</em></span> has given us, (viz. <em>That Love is that Original Weight, Bent or Indeavour, whereby the Soul stands inclin'd to, and is mov'd forwards to Good ingeneral, or Happiness</em>) tells as not so well what Love is, as our own Hearts can when we consult them; So perhaps an Examination of them will not only better acquaint us with the Nature of our Passions; but also direct us better to the Measures of their Regulation, than Notions concerning them deduced from the Consequences of an Hypothesis.","subId":"15","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let us therefore consider more particularly, how by the different Objects of our Love our Hearts are affected.","subId":"16","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When we say we love our selves Have we then only a simple Perception of Pleasure, and Complaisance in our Being?

The Continuation of our Being is necessary to our Happiness in the Beatifick Vision: And if we desire more of that Happiness by only desiring the Continuation of it, we certainly desire more of our selves, by desiring the Continuation of our Being.","subId":"17","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let us farther observe, how our Hearts are affected in our love of other things.

For the Perfection and Superlativeness of his Nature, makes him the Object of our Love, Desire and Benevolence, in a quite different way from Created Beings. We love God for those Excellencies of his Nature, wherein he infinitely surpasses all that is good, or desireable in the Creature. When we are said to Desire him, I think we mean such a Communication of his Goodness, whereby he bestows on us any Degree of Happiness: And in this sense, we shall to Eternity desire more and more of him.","subId":"19","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But he being both Necessary and Perfect, we can therefore wish no good to him, which he has not already; Because we cannot conceive any Addition of Good can be made to him.

Now, If any one will say, we ought not to be so pleased; They then deny that we ought to love: For we cannot love but what we are pleased with. It is true, that every one may apply words as they think fit; But then others ought to take care not to be imposed on by them. And if any one will either tell us, That we love things in which we find no Pleasure; Or, That being pleased with a thing, we do not yet love it; Or will call different Passions by the same Name; Or imply in the word <em>Love</em>, that complication of other Passions inseparable, indeed, from Love, but varying according to the Objects of it; It will concern us to examine what they say, before we receive their Dictates, as Measures for the Regulation of a Passion, upon the right Regulation of which depends both our Present, and Future Happiness.","subId":"21","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Love is but one simple Act of the Mind: But whether our desiring of what we love, or only wishing well to it, or both, follows that act of Love; the Nature of the lov'd Object alone Determines. For if that be both capable of being a good to us, and of receiving good from us, or from any thing else, it is then certain that we wish both: If it be capable of but one, and we know it to be so, it is certain we can then wish but one. The Distinction which is made of love of Benevolence, and Concupiscence, (arising only from the different Natures of the Objects of our Love) is only the Mis-application of the word Love to different acts consequent to Love, but distinct from it, and depending on the different Nature of the Object.","subId":"22","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But it is said, That <em>no Creature is capable of being a Good to us</em>.

And such kind of Expressions as carry not a Relative, but Absolute Abhorrence, or Contempt of Injoyments the most Lawful, seem only allowable, as unpremeditated Raptures of Devout Minds, not the Productions of Philosophical Disquisition; and will only affect those that are truely Pious, whilst they carry a show of some Truth in the Heart of the Speaker, which they strictly have not in themselves. For 'tis not unlikely that a lively Remorse may so turn the Stream of some Men's Affections from all sensible Pleasures, and give them so strong a Disgust for them, that the very Remembrances and Ideas of those Pleasures, even where allowable, may become Ungrateful: As Men have often Aversion to see or hear of Places or Persons, (othertimes Dear to them) by which, or in which, they have suffer'd much. The Passions where they are strong, argue by a Logick of their own, not that of Reason, which they often and significantly enough, invert to serve their own Purpose. And when Religion is in the case (with which too many are perswaded Reason has little to do) they can easily advance this so far, as to dress out an intire System, intelligible only by Sentiment, not to Reason; of which, perhaps some of the Mystical Divines are an Example. But to what Extravagance soever this may be carried, it is not therefore to be believed, That he who requires the Service of the whole Man, rejects the Passions from bearing a part; whilst we suffer them neither to impose upon our selves, nor others, to the admitting of wrong Notions, Prejudicial to true Religion.

And doubtless, with many plain, well-meaning People, (who understood not the Metaphysical Ground of it, But endeavour'd to practise it without pretending to prove it) it tended to great Austerities; sometimes perhaps Useful; but most commonly Superstitious, and Pernicious to true Religion. But a late Teacher of this Doctrine, tho' he has advanced the Theory, is more favourable in the practical part, than to recommend by it any such Popish Mortifications and Severities: And he, with great Reason, seems to believe, that the good things of this World were given to be enjoyed by us. No Creature he says, indeed, can be Loved, or Desired, without <em>Defrauding God, and even committing the Sin of Idolatry,</em> Vol. III. <em>Practical Discourse,</em> p. 62.67. Consequently therefore, there can be no more hateful Sin to the Almighty than (feeling Cold, or Hunger) to desire Fire, or Food, as any good to us: But he tells us at the same time, That tho' the things which satisfie these Natural Cravings are by no means to be desired as Goods; <em>Yet they may be securely sought for as such, and enjoyed,</em> p. 73, 74. He whose <em>Head is cast in a Metaphysical Mould</em> has, it may be, Privileges of Nature which accompany it, that ordinary Mortals are Strangers to; Who tho' they can conceive indeed a thing to be lov'd without being sought, or to be sought without being lov'd; Yet from the Frailty of their own Constitutions will scarce ever be perswaded in Fact that they, and this Author, being thoroughly Cold, seek for Fire, upon different Motives; Or will think that He being truly Hungry, seeks Food only upon a prudential Account, and not out of any Desire that he has to the Meat; Should he tell them ever so much, That the Mind of Man, conscious of its own Dignity, and Innate Nobleness, ought not to debase it self to such mean Affections, as the Love of any Creature: <em>The Creatures being no more capable to please any Faculty than to Create it; And therefore have no Pretence to the least Interest in our Love,</em> Prac.

This it is plain the Opinion of the Divines, and other Learned Men is, That the Scripture does so accommodate it self: Because they have interpreted this Text, and not this alone, but others also in such a Sense.

To the prevention of which, this Notion were it true, and receiv'd amongst Men as such, could be of no use at all, neither could it teach them not to ascend to the Love of God, by the Love of Creatures: Since it can be of use to none till they are convinc'd of it, and none are capable of being convinc'd of it, till sensible Objects by appearing the Causes of their Pleasing Sensations, have gotten Possession of their Love, and have as soon assur'd them that God is the Object the most worthy of their Love, as they have assured them of his Existence. It is true, when first in our infancy we feel pleasing Sensations, we are no more capable of being taught by them that there is a Superiour Invisible Being that made these things to affect us thus, who therefore ought supreamly to be lov'd; than that this Invisible Being, at the Presence of these Objects, exhibits to us a part of his own Essence, by which these Pleasing Sensations are excited on occasion of those Objects without us, and that therefore he is only and solely to be loved. But tho' we are uncapable of these both alike, when first we cry for the Fire, or the Sucking-Bottle; Yet it is certain, that by the former way we are not only safe, all the time of our Ignorance, from the Sin of Idolatry, and the fatal pre-ingagement of a sinful affection; but that our love to God upon that ground is of easier deduction, and earlier apprehended than by the latter. So soon as we do begin to leave off judging by appearances, and are Capable of being convinc'd that the Diameter of the Sun exceeds that of a Bushel; We are capable also of understanding that there is a Superiour Invisible Being, the Author of those things which afford us pleasing Sensations, who therefore is supreamly to be loved. But if we are not capable of scaping Idolatry unless we love God alone, because he immediately exhibits to us a part of his Essence, by which all pleasing Sensations are caus'd in us, I fear all Mankind (before this present Age) lived and died Idolaters, and the greatest part for the future will do so; Since I guess not One of a Thousand will be found capable of apprehending, and being convinced of this new Hypothesis of seeing all things in God. And as, I think, this cannot be denied, so is it also more suitable to the Wisdom, and Goodness of God, that it should be true. For one must say, that the Happiness and Welfare of Mankind were ill taken care for, if it depended upon a Knowledge, which not only few are ever likely to have, but which comes too late to any for much Use to be made of it. For when sensible Ideas have taken Possession of us for Twelve, or Twenty Years, they must be very ignorant of the constitution of Humane Nature, that can think it possible they should presently, or probably they should ever, be dispossess'd by a Notion, altho' a true one.","subId":"52","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.52"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And for this, <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N.</em></span> is not so kind as to furnish us with any remedy.

And if Loving the Creatures so, as yet to be willing readily to part with them all for the Love of God, or rather than offend in any thing that we know to be our Duty, (which is the highest Love of him that most People can conceive themselves capable of,) will not hinder us from being truely Idolaters, and Sacrilegious; Whilst being Hungry or Cold, Food or Fire are desired by us; And that we cannot Love our Children, or Friends, without looking on them as Goods Desireable to us; Methinks he should tell us by what means we may get rid of Appetites and Affections so offensive to God, and destructive to our Soul's Happiness; and should let us know whether he finds this attainable by our own Natural Abilities, or whether Christ has Purchas'd the Ability of doing it for those that believe in him; Or what we are to do, or conceive of our selves in an Estate so deplorable.

For we must not love any thing but what is our true Good, what can both deserve and reward our Love: And there can be but one thing that is so, and that must either be God or the Creature. If then the Creature be our Good, let us Love That, and that only; That, and not God: But if God be our True Good (as most certainly he is) then let us Love God, and God only; God, and not the Creature: For 'tis a most inconsistent and impracticable thing to talk of Carving out our Love between both: Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</em> <cite>Practical Discourse, <em>p.</em> 64, 65.</cite> By <em>Mammon,</em> I suppose was never understood before, any thing but Riches, or those things for which Riches are desired: And our Saviour here tells us, we must not set our Hearts upon these things, or make our selves Slaves, or Servants to them: That is, the Desire of them must not command us; If we command it, and make it Obedient to Reason, it is then certain it does not command us, and consequently that we are not Servants to it. This is then plainly no more, but that our Desires after Riches, <em>&amp;c.</em> must not be beyond their Worth; So as that we forget they are perishable, and uncertain Goods, such as Moth and Rust do corrupt, and the Violence and Injustice of Men may deprive us of; No longer (at best) of any value, than during our short abode in this World. For, if we do otherwise, our Reason is captivated, and we become truly Servants; The Servants of Mammon; And cannot be the Servants of God; Because we cannot Serve two so opposite and differing Masters. For it is from the contrariety of their Commands, and not from the littleness of our Minds, or Capacities, that we cannot Serve God and Mammon; Since neither little nor great can obey two Masters that command Contraries; And that is true of the Apostle, <em>His Servants ye are, to whom you obey.</em> But our Minds, as little as they are, may love God, and the Creature; when the Love of the Creature is Subordinate; And I think <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N.</em></span> nor no one else, will deny, That there are many who sincerely love God, that do yet love something in the Creature; And if so, whether their Love be Sinful, or no, it is evident their Capacities are not too little to love both; As it is also that our Reason is not captivated, and we thereby inslav'd, or render'd the Servants of every thing that we love. And here is nothing at all said by our Saviour of any other degree of Love, but such as makes us the Servants of what we love. And therefore it is no more true that we are here forbid by our Saviour to love any thing but God, than that our Capacities are too little to love any two different Objects.

His first Reason therefore why we cannot divide our Love, <em>viz.</em> From the scantiness of Our Capacities, is utterly false; our Capacities being evidently not too narrow to love any two different Objects, or even every Object which appears to us to be lovely. And there is no reason that if we love the Creatures in some degree, as occasions of Pleasure to us (we necessarily loving whatever is accompanied with Pleasure) that That Love of the Creature should exclude the Love of God; any more than that the Love of Cherries should exclude the love of our Friend that gives them us. And if we love God, yet less does the Love of him exclude our Love of his Creatures: For we love them then not only for the Pleasure that they occasion us, but for the sake of their Author; and the more we Love God, the more we shall Love his Creatures.","subId":"59","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.59"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But another Reason, besides the narrowness of our Capacities, Why <em>we cannot divide our Love</em> between God and the Creature, is, <em>because we cannot love either of them, but upon such a Principle as must utterly exclude the love of the other</em>; which is thus offer'd to be made out: <em>We must not love any thing but what is our true Good: There can be but one thing that is so: And that must be either God, or the Creature.</em>","subId":"60","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.60"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What is our <em>True Good</em>, he tells us is that which can both <em>Deserve and Reward our Love</em>.

But whether it were that <span class=\"name\">Mr. <em>N.</em></span> has no inclination to this way of Living, and that it is to That that we owe his Happy Invention of Seeking, and injoying the good things of the World, without loving them; Or that he was afraid by owning his Opinion (that we are obliged to renounce the World and live in Woods) He should be suspected of favouring Popish Superstition; He can scarcely be presum'd not to see that this inevitably follows from the Hypothesis he has embraced. But yet how injurious soever this Consequence is to Religion, so much is not therefore deny'd to what <span class=\"name\"><em>Per. Malebranche</em></span> largely insists upon, <em>viz.</em> That Retirement is sometimes useful, if not necessary to a Christian Life. Those who live always in the hurry of the World, and the avocations of Worldly Business, without giving themselves time, and retreat, frequently to reflect, being no doubt very likely to enter too much into the Spirit of it; We insensibly giving up our selves to, and uniting our Hearts with what we are constantly ingaged in, and with delight apply our selves to. But if in opposition to this, any one should run into the other extream, of retreating wholly from all commerce and conversation with Men; And should give themselves the Happiness <span class=\"name\"><em>Pere Malebranche</em></span> speaks of, of <em>attending Eternity in Desarts</em>; it is to be fear'd they would not mend the Matter. For whatever Vices they might part with by it, they must necessarily oppose thereby, one great end that they were sent into the World for, <em>viz.</em> of doing good; By becoming wholly useless to others: And such a one would certainly, by such a renunciation of all commerce with Men, be likelier to grow Wild, than improve the great Virtue of Christianity, and Ornament of Humane Nature, Good Will, Charity, and the being Useful to others.","subId":"80","id":"Masham.DLG.Body.80"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for Monasteries, and Religious Houses, (as they are call'd) all who are acquainted with them, know that they are nothing less than what is pretended; And serve only to draw in Discontented, Devout People, with an imaginary Happiness.
