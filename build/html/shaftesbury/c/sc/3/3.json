There are more Wheels and <em>Counter-Poises</em> in this Engine than are easily imagin'd. 'Tis of too complex a kind, to fall under one simple View, or be explain'd thus briefly in a word or two. The Studiers of this <em>Mechanism</em> must have a very partial Eye, to overlook all other Motions besides those of the lowest and narrowest compass. 'Tis hard, that in the Plan or Description of this Clock-work, no Wheel or Balance shou'd be allow'd on the side of the better and more enlarg'd Affections; that nothing shou'd be understood to be done <em>in Kindness,</em> or <em>Generosity;</em> nothing in <em>pure Good-Nature</em> or <em>Friendship,</em> or thro' any <em>social</em> or <em>natural Affection</em> of any kind: when, perhaps, the main Springs of this Machine will be found to be either these very <em>natural Affections</em> themselves, or a compound kind deriv'd from them, and retaining more than one half of their Nature.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.3.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But here (my Friend!) you must not expect that I shou'd draw you up a formal<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <em>Scheme</em> of the <em>Passions,</em> or pretend to shew you their <em>Genealogy</em> and <em>Relation;</em> how they are interwoven with one another, or interfere with our Happiness and Interest.

A primitive Father and Founder among these, saw well this Power of<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <em>Nature,</em> and understood it so far, that he earnestly exhorted his Followers neither to beget Children, nor serve their Country. There was no dealing with Nature, it seems, while these alluring Objects stood in the way. <em>Relations, Friends, Countrymen, Laws, Politick Constitutions, the Beauty of Order and Government,</em> and <em>the Interest of Society and Mankind,</em> were Objects which, he well saw, wou'd <em>naturally</em> raise a stronger Affection than any which was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere <span class=\"small-capitals\">Self.</span> His Advice, therefore, not to marry, nor engage at all in the Publick, was wise, and sutable to his Design. There was no way to be truly a Disciple of this Philosophy, but to leave Family, Friends, Country, and Society, <em>to cleave to it.</em>—And, in good earnest, who wou'd not, if it were <em>Happiness</em> to do so?—The Philosopher, however, was <em>kind,</em> in telling us his Thought.

They seem to have understood less of this force of Nature, and thought to alter <em>the Thing,</em> by shifting <em>a Name.</em> They wou'd so explain all the social Passions, and natural Affections, as to denominate 'em <em>of</em><a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <em>the selfish kind.</em> Thus Civility, Hospitality, Humanity towards Strangers or People in distress, is only <em>a more deliberate Selfishness.</em> An honest Heart is only <em>a more cunning one:</em> and Honesty and Good-Nature, <em>a more deliberate,</em> or <em>better-regulated Self-Love.</em> The <em>Love</em> of Kindred, Children and Posterity, is purely <em>Love of Self,</em> and of <em>one's own immediate Blood:</em> As if, by this Reckoning, all Mankind were not included; <em>All</em> being of <em>one Blood,</em> and join'd by Inter-Marriages and Alliances; as they have been transplanted in Colonys, and mix'd one with another. And thus <em>Love of one's Country,</em> and <em>Love of Mankind,</em> must also be <em>Self-Love.</em> <em>Magnanimity</em> and <em>Courage,</em> no doubt, are Modifications of this universal <em>Self-Love!</em> For<a href=\"#n5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <em>Courage</em> (says our modern Philosopher) is <em>constant Anger.</em> And <em>all Men</em> (says<a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> a witty Poet) <em>wou'd be Cowards if they durst.</em>","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.3.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That the Poet, and the Philosopher both, were <em>Cowards,</em> may be yielded perhaps without dispute.

But for <em>true Courage,</em> it has so little to do with <em>Anger,</em> that there lies always the strongest Suspicion against it, where this Passion is highest. The <em>true</em> Courage is the <em>cool</em> and <em>calm.</em> The bravest of Men have the least of a brutal bullying Insolence; and in the very time of Danger are found the most serene, pleasant, and free. Rage, we know, can make a Coward forget himself and fight. But what is done in <em>Fury</em> or <em>Anger,</em> can never be plac'd to the account of <em>Courage.</em> Were it otherwise, Womankind might claim to be the <em>stoutest</em> Sex: for their Hatred and Anger have ever been allow'd the strongest and most lasting.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.3.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Other Authors there have been of a yet inferior kind: a sort of<a href=\"#n7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Distributers and petty Retailers of this Wit; who have run Changes, and Divisions, without end, upon this Article of <em>Self-Love.</em> You have the very same Thought spun out a hundred ways, and drawn into Motto's, and Devises, to set forth this Riddle; That <q>act as disinterestedly or generously as you please, <em>Self</em> still is at the bottom, and nothing else.</q> Now if these Gentlemen, who delight so much in the Play of Words, but are cautious how they grapple closely with Definitions, wou'd tell us only what<a href=\"#n8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <em>Self-Interest</em> was, and determine <em>Happiness</em> and <em>Good,</em> there wou'd be an end of this enigmatical Wit.

'Tis as these Feelings and Affections are intrinsecally valuable and worthy, that <em>Self-Interest</em> is to be rated and esteem'd. A Man is by nothing so much <em>himself,</em> as by his <em>Temper,</em> and <em>the Character of his Passions and Affections.</em> If he loses what is manly and worthy in these, he is as much lost to himself as when he loses his Memory and Understanding. The least step into Villany or Baseness, changes the Character and Value of a Life. He who wou'd preserve Life at any rate, must abuse <em>himself</em> more than any-one can abuse him.
