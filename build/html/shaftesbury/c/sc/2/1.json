Tho he might at first perhaps have look'd on this with a serious eye, it wou'd be hardly possible for him to hold his Countenance, when he had perceiv'd what was carrying on. The <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europeans,</span> on their side, might laugh perhaps at this Simplicity. But our <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ethiopian</span> wou'd certainly laugh with better reason. 'Tis easy to see which of the two wou'd be ridiculous. For he who laughs, and is himself ridiculous, bears a double share of Ridicule. However, shou'd it so happen, that in the Transport of Ridicule, our <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ethiopian,</span> having his Head still running upon <em>Masks,</em> and knowing nothing of the <em>fair</em> Complexion and common Dress of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europeans,</span> shou'd upon the sight of a natural Face and Habit, laugh just as heartily as before; wou'd not he in his turn become ridiculous, by carrying the Jest too far; when by a silly Presumption he took <em>Nature</em> for mere <em>Art,</em> and mistook perhaps a Man of Sobriety and Sense for one of those ridiculous <em>Mummers?</em>","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.2.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There was a time when Men were accountable only for their Actions and Behaviour. Their Opinions were left to themselves. They had liberty to differ in these, as in their Faces. Every one took the Air and Look which was natural to him. But in process of time, it was thought decent to mend Mens Countenances, and render their intellectual Complexions uniform and of a sort. Thus the Magistrate became <em>a Dresser,</em> and in his turn was <em>dress'd</em> too, as he deserv'd; when he had given up his Power to a new Order of <em>Tire-Men.</em> But tho in this extraordinary conjuncture 'twas agreed that there was only one <em>certain</em> and <em>true Dress,</em> one <em>single</em> peculiar <em>Air,</em> to which it was necessary all People shou'd conform; yet the misery was, that neither the Magistrate nor the <em>Tire-Men</em> themselves, cou'd resolve, which of the various Modes was the <em>exact true-one.</em> Imagine now, what the Effect of this must needs be; when Men became persecuted thus on every side about their <em>Air</em> and <em>Feature,</em> and were put to their shifts how to adjust and compose their <em>Mein,</em> according to the right Mode; when a thousand Models, a thousand Patterns of Dress were current, and alter'd every now and then, upon occasion, according to <em>Fashion</em> and the Humour of the Times.

All is not <em>Fucus,</em> or mere Varnish. Nor is the Face of Truth less fair and beautiful, for all the counterfeit Vizards which have been put upon her. We must remember the <em>Carnival,</em> and what the Occasion has been of this wild Concourse and Medley; who were the Institutors of it; and to what purpose Men were thus set a-work and amus'd. We may laugh sufficiently at the original Cheat; and, if pity will suffer us, may make our-selves diversion enough with the Folly and Madness of those who are thus caught, and practis'd on, by these Impostures. But we must remember withal our <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ethiopian,</span> and beware, lest by taking plain Nature for a Vizard, we become more ridiculous than the People whom we ridicule.
