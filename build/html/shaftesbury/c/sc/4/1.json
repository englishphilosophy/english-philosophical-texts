'Tis in reality a serious Study, to learn to temper and regulate that <em>Humour</em> which Nature has given us, as a more lenitive Remedy against Vice, and a kind of Specifick against Superstition and melancholy Delusion. There is a great difference between seeking how to raise a Laugh from every thing; and seeking, in every thing, what justly may be laugh'd at. For nothing is ridiculous except what is deform'd: Nor is any thing proof against <em>Raillery,</em> except what is handsom and just. And therefore 'tis the hardest thing in the World, to deny <em>fair</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Honesty</span> the use of this Weapon, which can never bear an Edge against her-self, and bears against every thing contrary.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the very <em>Italian</em> Buffoons were to give us the Rule in these cases, we shou'd learn by them, that in their lowest and most scurrilous way of Wit, there was nothing so successfully to be play'd upon, as the Passions of Cowardice and Avarice. One may defy the World to turn real <em>Bravery</em> or <em>Generosity</em> into Ridicule. A Glutton or mere Sensualist is as ridiculous as the other two Characters. Nor can an unaffected <em>Temperance</em> be made the Subject of Contempt to any besides the grossest and most contemptible of Mankind. Now these <em>three</em> Ingredients make up a virtuous Character: as <em>the contrary three</em> a vicious one. How therefore can we possibly make a Jest of Honesty?—To laugh <em>both</em> ways, is nonsensical. And if the Ridicule lie against <em>Sottishness, Avarice,</em> and <em>Cowardice;</em> you see the Consequence. A Man must be soundly ridiculous, who, with all the Wit imaginable, wou'd go about to ridicule Wisdom, or laugh at Honesty, or Good Manners.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Man of thorow<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <em>Good-Breeding,</em> whatever else he be, is incapable of doing a rude or brutal Action. He never <em>deliberates</em> in this case, or considers of the matter by prudential Rules of Self-Interest and Advantage. He acts from his Nature, in a manner necessarily, and without Reflection: and if he did not, it were impossible for him to answer his Character, or be found that truly well-bred Man, on every occasion. 'Tis the same with the <em>honest Man.</em> He can't deliberate in the Case of a plain Villany. <em>A Plum</em> is no Temptation to him. He likes and loves himself too well, to change Hearts with one of those corrupt Miscreants, who amongst 'em gave that name to a round Sum of Mony gain'd by Rapine and Plunder of the Commonwealth. He who wou'd enjoy <em>a Freedom of Mind,</em> and be truly <em>Possessor of himself,</em> must be above the thought of stooping to what is villanous or base. He, on the other side, who has a Heart to stoop, must necessarily quit the thought of <em>Manliness, Resolution, Friendship, Merit,</em> and <em>a Character with himself and others:</em> But to affect these Enjoyments and Advantages, together with the Privileges of a licentious Principle; to pretend to enjoy <em>Society,</em> and <em>a free Mind,</em> in company with <em>a knavish Heart,</em> is as ridiculous as the way of Children, who eat their Cake, and afterwards cry for it.

Yet had we Sense, we should consider 'tis in reality the <em>thorow profligate Knave,</em> the very <em>compleat unnatural Villain</em> alone, who can any way bid for Happiness with the <em>honest Man.</em> True Interest is wholly on <em>one</em> side, or <em>the other.</em> All between is<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Inconsistency, Irresolution, Remorse, Vexation, and an Ague-Fit: from hot to cold; from one Passion to another quite contrary; a perpetual Discord of Life; and an alternate Disquiet and Self-dislike.

Both must agree; else all must be Disturbance and Confusion. So that to think with one's self, in good earnest, <q>Why may not one do this <em>little</em> Villany, or commit this <em>one</em> Treachery, and but for <em>once</em></q>; is the most ridiculous Imagination in the world, and contrary to <span class=\"small-capitals\">CommonSense.</span> For a common honest Man, whilst left to himself, and undisturb'd by Philosophy and subtle Reasonings about his Interest, gives no other Answer to the thought of Villany, than that <em>he can't possibly find in his heart</em> to set about it, or conquer the natural Aversion he has to it.
