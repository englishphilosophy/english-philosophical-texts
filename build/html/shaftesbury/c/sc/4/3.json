However, his Piece, if it be beautiful, and carrys <em>Truth,</em> must be <em>a Whole,</em> by it-self, compleat, independent, and withal as <em>great</em> and comprehensive as he can make it. So that Particulars, on this occasion, must yield to the general Design; and all things be subservient to that which is principal: in order to form a certain <em>Easiness of Sight;</em> a simple, clear, and<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <em>united View,</em> which wou'd be broken and disturb'd by the Expression of any thing peculiar or distinct.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now the Variety of Nature is such as to distinguish every thing she forms, by a <em>peculiar</em> original Character; which, if strictly observ'd, will make the Subject appear unlike to any thing extant in the World besides. But this Effect the good Poet and Painter seek industriously to prevent. They hate <em>Minuteness,</em> and are afraid of <em>Singularity;</em> which wou'd make their Images, or Characters, appear capricious and fantastical. The mere Face-Painter, indeed, has little in common with the Poet; but, like the mere Historian, copys what he sees, and minutely traces every Feature, and odd Mark. 'Tis otherwise with the Men of Invention and Design. 'Tis from the <em>many</em> Objects of Nature, and not from <em>a particular-one,</em> that those Genius's form the Idea of their Work. Thus the best Artists are said to have been indefatigable in studying the best Statues: as esteeming them a better Rule, than the perfectest human Bodys cou'd afford.

I have taken the liberty, you see, to <em>laugh,</em> upon some occasions: And if I have either laugh'd wrong, or been impertinently serious; I can be content to be <em>laugh'd at,</em> in my turn. If contrariwise I am rail'd at, I can <em>laugh</em> still, as before; and with fresh advantage to my Cause.

On the contrary, there is something comical in the case. It brings to one's mind the Fancy of those Grotesque Figures, and Dragon-Faces, which are seen often in the Frontispiece, and on the Corner-Stones of old Buildings. They seem plac'd there, as the <em>Defenders</em> and <em>Supporters</em> of the Edifice; but with all their Grimace, are as harmless to People without, as they are useless to the Building within.

For when it is gigantick, 'tis in a manner out of sight, and can be no way comprehended in that simple and <em>united View.</em> As, on the contrary, when a Piece is of the Miniature-kind; when it runs into the <em>Detail,</em> and nice Delineation of every little Particular; 'tis, as it were, invisible, for the same reason; because the <em>summary Beauty,</em> the <em>WHOLE it-self,</em> cannot be comprehended in that <em>ONE united View;</em> which is broken and lost by the necessary attraction of the Eye to every small and subordinate Part. In a poetick System, the same regard must be had to the Memory, as in Painting to the Eye. The Dramatick kind is confin'd within the convenient and proper time of a Spectacle. The Epick is left more at large. Each Work, however, must aim at <em>Vastness,</em> and be as <em>great,</em> and of as long duration as possible; but so as to be comprehended, as to the main of it, by one easy <em>Glance</em> or Retrospect of Memory. And this the Philosopher calls, accordingly, the τὸ Εὐμνημόνευτον <cite>the Beautiful</cite>.</q> I cannot better translate the Passage than as I have done in these explanatory Lines. For besides what relates to mere Art, the philosophical Sense of the Original is so majestick, and the whole Treatise so masterly, that when I find even the <em>Latin</em> Interpreters come so short, I shou'd be vain to attempt any thing in our own Language. I wou'd only add a small Remark of my own, which may perhaps be notic'd by the Studiers of Statuary and Painting: That the greatest of the antient as well as modern Artists, were ever inclin'd to follow this Rule of the Philosopher; and when they err'd in their <em>Designs,</em> or <em>Draughts,</em> it was on the side of <em>Greatness,</em> by running into the unsizable and gigantick, rather than into the <em>minute</em> and delicate. Of this, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mich.Angelo,</span> the great Beginner and Founder among the Moderns, and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Zeuxis</span> the same among the Antients, may serve as Instances. See <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny,</span> <em>lib.</em> 35. <em>cap.</em> 9. concerning <span class=\"small-capitals\">Zeuxis,</span> and the Notes of Father <span class=\"small-capitals\">Harduin</span> in his Edition <em>in usum Delphini,</em> p. 200. on the words, <em>Deprehenditur tamen Zeuxis,</em> &amp;c.
