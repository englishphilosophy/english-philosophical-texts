However, his Piece, if it be beautiful, and carrys <em>Truth,</em> must be <em>a Whole,</em> by it-self, compleat, independent, and withal as <em>great</em> and comprehensive as he can make it. So that Particulars, on this occasion, must yield to the general Design; and all things be subservient to that which is principal: in order to form a certain <em>Easiness of Sight;</em> a simple, clear, and<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <em>united View,</em> which wou'd be broken and disturb'd by the Expression of any thing peculiar or distinct.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.4.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now the Variety of Nature is such as to distinguish every thing she forms, by a <em>peculiar</em> original Character; which, if strictly observ'd, will make the Subject appear unlike to any thing extant in the World besides. But this Effect the good Poet and Painter seek industriously to prevent. They hate <em>Minuteness,</em> and are afraid of <em>Singularity;</em> which wou'd make their Images, or Characters, appear capricious and fantastical. The mere Face-Painter, indeed, has little in common with the Poet; but, like the mere Historian, copys what he sees, and minutely traces every Feature, and odd Mark. 'Tis otherwise with the Men of Invention and Design. 'Tis from the <em>many</em> Objects of Nature, and not from <em>a particular-one,</em> that those Genius's form the Idea of their Work. Thus the best Artists are said to have been indefatigable in studying the best Statues: as esteeming them a better Rule, than the perfectest human Bodys cou'd afford.

I have taken the liberty, you see, to <em>laugh,</em> upon some occasions: And if I have either laugh'd wrong, or been impertinently serious; I can be content to be <em>laugh'd at,</em> in my turn. If contrariwise I am rail'd at, I can <em>laugh</em> still, as before; and with fresh advantage to my Cause. For tho, in reality, there cou'd be nothing less a laughing matter, than the provok'd Rage, Ill-will, and Fury of certain zealous Gentlemen, were they arm'd as lately they have been known; yet as the Magistrate has since taken care to pare their Talons, there is nothing very terrible in their Encounter. On the contrary, there is something comical in the case. It brings to one's mind the Fancy of those Grotesque Figures, and Dragon-Faces, which are seen often in the Frontispiece, and on the Corner-Stones of old Buildings. They seem plac'd there, as the <em>Defenders</em> and <em>Supporters</em> of the Edifice; but with all their Grimace, are as harmless to People without, as they are useless to the Building within.

For when it is gigantick, 'tis in a manner out of sight, and can be no way comprehended in that simple and <em>united View.</em> As, on the contrary, when a Piece is of the Miniature-kind; when it runs into the <em>Detail,</em> and nice Delineation of every little Particular; 'tis, as it were, invisible, for the same reason; because the <em>summary Beauty,</em> the <em>WHOLE it-self,</em> cannot be comprehended in that <em>ONE united View;</em> which is broken and lost by the necessary attraction of the Eye to every small and subordinate Part. In a poetick System, the same regard must be had to the Memory, as in Painting to the Eye. The Dramatick kind is confin'd within the convenient and proper time of a Spectacle. The Epick is left more at large. Each Work, however, must aim at <em>Vastness,</em> and be as <em>great,</em> and of as long duration as possible; but so as to be comprehended, as to the main of it, by one easy <em>Glance</em> or Retrospect of Memory. And this the Philosopher calls, accordingly, the τὸ Εὐμνημόνευτον <cite>the Beautiful</cite>.</q> I cannot better translate the Passage than as I have done in these explanatory Lines. For besides what relates to mere Art, the philosophical Sense of the Original is so majestick, and the whole Treatise so masterly, that when I find even the <em>Latin</em> Interpreters come so short, I shou'd be vain to attempt any thing in our own Language. I wou'd only add a small Remark of my own, which may perhaps be notic'd by the Studiers of Statuary and Painting: That the greatest of the antient as well as modern Artists, were ever inclin'd to follow this Rule of the Philosopher; and when they err'd in their <em>Designs,</em> or <em>Draughts,</em> it was on the side of <em>Greatness,</em> by running into the unsizable and gigantick, rather than into the <em>minute</em> and delicate. Of this, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mich.Angelo,</span> the great Beginner and Founder among the Moderns, and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Zeuxis</span> the same among the Antients, may serve as Instances. See <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny,</span> <em>lib.</em> 35. <em>cap.</em> 9. concerning <span class=\"small-capitals\">Zeuxis,</span> and the Notes of Father <span class=\"small-capitals\">Harduin</span> in his Edition <em>in usum Delphini,</em> p. 200. on the words, <em>Deprehenditur tamen Zeuxis,</em> &amp;c.
