What the Zeal was of many early Christians against the Idolatry of the old Heathen Church (at that time the establish'd one) may be comprehended by any Person who is ever so slenderly vers'd in the History of those Times. Nor can it be said indeed of us Moderns, that in the quality of <em>good Christians</em> (as that Character is generally understood) we are found either backward or scrupulous in assigning to Perdition such Wretches as we pronounce <em>guilty of Idolatry</em>. The name <em>Idolater</em> is sufficient Excuse for almost any kind of Insult against the Person, and much more against the Worship of such a Mis-Believer. The very word <em>Christian</em> is in common Language us'd for <em>Man</em>, in opposition to <em>Brute-Beast</em>, without leaving so much as a middle place for the poor <em>Heathen</em> or <em>Pagan</em>: who, as the greater Beast of the two, is naturally doom'd to Massacre, and his Gods and Temples to Fracture and Demolishment. Nor are we masters of this Passion, even in our best humour. The <em>French</em> Poets, we see, can with great Success, and general Applause, exhibit this primitive Zeal even on the publick Stage: <cite><span class=\"small-capitals\">Polyeucte</span>, Act II.

It was no more indeed than had been said of that virtuous and gallant Emperor by his greatest Enemys; even by those who, to the shame of Christianity, boasted of his having been most insolently affronted on all occasions, and even treacherously assassinated by one of his Christian Soldiers. As for such Authors as these, shou'd I cite them in their proper invective Style and Saint-like Phrase, they wou'd make no very agreeable appearance, especially in <em>Miscellanys</em> of the kind we have here undertaken. But a Letter of that elegant and witty Emperor, may not be improperly plac'd amongst our Citations, as a Pattern of his Humour and Genius, as well as of his Principle and Sentiments, on this occasion. <cite><span class=\"small-capitals\">Julian</span>'s <em>Epistles</em>, Numb. 52.</cite> <blockquote><span class=\"small-capitals\">Julian</span> to the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Bostrens</span>. <br> <q><em>I should have thought, indeed, that the </em>Galilaean<em> Leaders wou'd have esteem'd themselves more indebted to me, than to him who preceded me in the Administration of the Empire. For in his time, many of them suffer'd Exile, Persecution, and Imprisonment. Multitudes of those whom in their Religion they term </em>Hereticks<em>, were put to the sword. Insomuch that in </em>Samosata<em>, </em>Cyzicum<em>, </em>Paphlagonia<em>, </em>Bithynia<em>, </em>Galatia<em>, and many other Countrys, whole Towns were level'd with the Earth. The just Reverse of this has been observ'd in my time. The Exiles have been recall'd; and the Proscrib'd restor'd to the lawful Possession of their Estates. But to that height of Fury and Distraction are this People arriv'd, that being no longer allow'd the Privilege to tyrannize over one another, or persecute either their own Sectarys, or the Religious of the lawful Church, they swell with rage, and leave no stone unturn'd, no opportunity unimploy'd, of raising Tumult and Sedition. So little regard have they to true Piety; so little Obedience to our Laws and Constitutions; however humane and tolerating. For still do we determine and steddily resolve, never to suffer one of them to be drawn involuntarily to our Altars. * * * As for the mere People, indeed, they appear driven to these Riots and Seditions by those amongst them whom they call CLERICKS: who are now enrag'd to find themselves restrain'd in the use of their former Power and intemperate Rule. * * * They can no longer act the Magistrate or Civil Judg, nor assume Authority to make Peoples </em>Wills<em>, supplant Relations, possess themselves of other Mens Patrimonys, and by specious Pretences transfer </em>all<em> into their own possession. * * * For this reason I have thought fit, by this </em>Publick EDICT<em>, to forewarn the People of this sort, that they raise no more Commotions, nor gather in a riotous manner about their seditious CLERICKS, in defiance of the Magistrate, who has been insulted and in danger of being ston'd by these incited Rabbles. In their Congregations they may, notwithstanding, assemble as they please, and croud about their Leaders, performing Worship, receiving Doctrine, and praying, according as they are by them taught and conducted: But if with any Tendency to Sedition; let them beware how they hearken, or give assent; and remember, 'tis at their peril, if by these means they are secretly wrought up to Mutiny and Insurrection. * * * Live, therefore, in Peace and Quietness! neither spitefully opposing, or injuriously treating one another. You misguided People of the new way, Beware, on your side! And you of the antient and establish'd Church, injure not your Neighbours and Fellow-Citizens, who are enthusiastically led away, in Ignorance and Mistake, rather than with Design or Malice! 'Tis by DISCOURSE and REASON, not by </em>Blows<em>, </em>Insults<em>, or </em>Violence<em>, that Men are to be inform'd of Truth, and convinc'd of Error. Again therefore and again I enjoin and charge the zealous Followers of the true Religion, no way to injure, molest, or affront the </em>Galilaean<em> People.</em></blockquote></q> Thus the generous and mild Emperor; whom we may indeed call <em>Heathen</em>, but not so justly <em>Apostate</em>: since being, at different times of his Youth, transfer'd to different Schools or Universitys, and bred under Tutors of each Religion, as well <em>Heathen</em> as <em>Christian</em>; he happen'd, when of full age, to make his choice (tho very unfortunately) in the former kind, and adher'd to the antient Religion of his Country and Forefathers.
