The Reason given, was <q><em>the illiberal Air</em> which attended such Performers, and <em>the unmanly Disfiguration</em> of their Looks and Countenance, which this Piping-work produc'd.</q> As for the real Figure or Plight of the <em>superstitious Mind,</em> our Author thus describes it: <q><em>Gladly wou'd the poor comfortless Mind, by whiles, keep Festival and rejoice: But such as its Religion is, there can be no free Mirth or Joy belonging to it. Publick Thanksgivings are but private Mournings. Sighs and Sorrows accompany its Praises. Fears and Horrors corrupt its best Affections. When it assumes the outward Ornaments of best Apparel for the Temple, it even then strikes Melancholy, and appears in Paleness and ghastly Looks. While it worships, it trembles. It sends up Vows in faint and feeble Voices, with eager Hopes, Desires, and Passions, discoverable in the whole Disorder of the outward Frame: and, in the main, it evinces plainly by Practice, that the Notion of</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pythagoras</span> <em>was but vain, who dar'd assert,</em> That we were then in the best State, and carry'd our most becoming Looks with us, when we approach'd the Gods. <em>For then, above all other Seasons, are the Superstitious found in the most abject miserable State of Mind, and with the meanest Presence and Behaviour; approaching the Sacred Shrines of the Divine Powers in the same manner as they wou'd the Dens of Bears or Lions, the Caves of Basilisks or Dragons, or other hideous Recesses of wild Beasts or raging Monsters. To me therefore it appears wonderful, that we shou'd arraign Atheism as impious; whilst Superstition escapes the Charge. Shall he who holds there are no Divine Powers, be esteem'd impious; and shall not he be esteem'd far more impious, who holds the Divine Beings such in their Nature as the Superstitious believe and represent? For my own part, I had rather Men shou'd say of me,</em> &amp;c.</q> See VOL. I. <em>pag.</em> 41. in the Notes. Nothing can be more remarkable than what our Author says again, a little below. <q><em>The</em> Atheist <em>believes there is no Deity; the</em> Religionist, <em>or superstitious Believer, wishes there were none. If he believes, 'tis against his Will: mistrust he dares not, nor call his Thought in question. But cou'd he with Security, at once, throw off that oppressive Fear, which like the Rock of</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tantalus</span> <em>impends, and presses over him, he wou'd with equal Joy spurn his inslaving Thought, and embrace the Atheist's State and Opinion as his happiest Deliverance.

This, says he, is plain and evident from the most demonstrable Testimonys. For neither the Societys, or Publick Meetings in the Temples, nor the Festivals themselves, nor any other diverting Partys, Sights, or Entertainments, are more delightful or rejoicing than what we our-selves behold, and act in the Divine Worship, and in the Holy Sacrifices and Mysterys which belong to it. Our Disposition and Temper is not, on this occasion, as if we were in the Presence of worldly Potentates, dread Sovereigns, and despotick Princes.
