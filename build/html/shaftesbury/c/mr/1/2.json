If Authors writ <em>ill,</em> they were despis'd: If <em>well,</em> they were by some Party or other espous'd. For <em>Partys</em> there wou'd necessarily be, and <em>Sects</em> of every kind, in Learning and Philosophy. Every one sided with whom he lik'd; and having the liberty of hearing <em>each</em> side speak for it-self, stood in no need of express <em>Warning-Pieces</em> against pretended Sophistry, or dangerous Reasoning. Particular <em>Answers</em> to single Treatises, were thought to be of little use. And it was esteem'd no Compliment to a Reader, to help him so carefully in the Judgment of every Piece which came abroad. Whatever <em>Sects</em> there were in those days, the Zeal of <em>Party</em>-causes ran not so high as to give the Reader a Taste of those <em>personal</em> Reproaches, which might pass in a Debate between the different <em>Partymen.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus Matters stood of old; when as yet the Method of writing <em>Controversy</em> was not rais'd into an <em>Art,</em> nor the Feuds of contending Authors become the chief Amusement of the learned World. But we have at present so high a Relish of this kind, that the Writings of the Learned are never truly gustful till they are come to what we may properly enough call <em>their due Ripeness,</em> and have begot a <em>Fray.</em> When the <em>Answer</em> and <em>Reply</em> is once form'd, our Curiosity is excited: We begin then, for the first time, to whet our Attention, and apply our Ear.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For example: Let a zealous <em>Divine</em> and flaming Champion of our Faith, when inclin'd to shew himself in Print, make choice of some tremendous <em>Mystery</em> of Religion, oppos'd heretofore by some damnable <em>Heresiarch;</em> whom having vehemently refuted, he turns himself towards the orthodox Opinion, and supports the true Belief, with the highest Eloquence and profoundest Erudition; he shall, notwithstanding this, remain perhaps in deep Obscurity, to the great affliction of his Bookseller, and the regret of all who bear a just Veneration for <em>Church-history,</em> and the antient Purity of the <em>Christian</em> Faith. But let it so happen that in this Prosecution of his deceas'd Adversary, our <em>Doctor</em> raises up some <em>living Antagonist;</em> who, on the same foot of Orthodoxy with himself, pretends to arraign his Expositions, and refute the Refuter upon every Article he has advanc'd; from this moment the Writing gathers Life, the Publick listens, the Bookseller takes heart; and when Issue is well join'd, the Repartees grown smart, and the Contention vigorous between the learned Partys, <em>a Ring</em> is made, and <em>Readers</em> gather in abundance. Every one <em>takes party,</em> and encourages his <em>own</em> Side. <q>This shall be my Champion!—This Man for my Money!—Well hit, on our side!—Again, a good Stroke!—There he was even with him!—Have at him the next Bout!</q>—Excellent Sport! And when the <em>Combatants</em> are for a-while drawn off, and each retir'd with his own Companions; What <em>Praises,</em> and <em>Congratulations!</em> What <em>Applauses</em> of the suppos'd <em>Victor!</em> And how honourably is he saluted by his Favourers, and complimented even to the disturbance of his Modesty! <q>Nay, but Gentlemen!—Good Gentlemen!
