If Authors writ <em>ill,</em> they were despis'd: If <em>well,</em> they were by some Party or other espous'd. For <em>Partys</em> there wou'd necessarily be, and <em>Sects</em> of every kind, in Learning and Philosophy. Every one sided with whom he lik'd; and having the liberty of hearing <em>each</em> side speak for it-self, stood in no need of express <em>Warning-Pieces</em> against pretended Sophistry, or dangerous Reasoning. Particular <em>Answers</em> to single Treatises, were thought to be of little use. And it was esteem'd no Compliment to a Reader, to help him so carefully in the Judgment of every Piece which came abroad. Whatever <em>Sects</em> there were in those days, the Zeal of <em>Party</em>-causes ran not so high as to give the Reader a Taste of those <em>personal</em> Reproaches, which might pass in a Debate between the different <em>Partymen.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.1.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus Matters stood of old; when as yet the Method of writing <em>Controversy</em> was not rais'd into an <em>Art,</em> nor the Feuds of contending Authors become the chief Amusement of the learned World.

But let it so happen that in this Prosecution of his deceas'd Adversary, our <em>Doctor</em> raises up some <em>living Antagonist;</em> who, on the same foot of Orthodoxy with himself, pretends to arraign his Expositions, and refute the Refuter upon every Article he has advanc'd; from this moment the Writing gathers Life, the Publick listens, the Bookseller takes heart; and when Issue is well join'd, the Repartees grown smart, and the Contention vigorous between the learned Partys, <em>a Ring</em> is made, and <em>Readers</em> gather in abundance.
