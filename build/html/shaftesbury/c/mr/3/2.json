Quod quale sit, non tam definitione quâ sum usus intelligi potest (quanquam aliquantum potest) quam COMMUNI omnium JUDICIO, &amp; optimi cujusque studiis, atque factis a qui permulta ob eam unam causam faciunt, quia decet, quia rectum, quia honestum est; etsi nullum consecuturum emolumentum vident.</em></q> <cite>By <em>right</em> therefore I understand what is such that, apart from expediency, without any reward or profit, it can properly be praised on its own account. What sort of thing, that is, may be understood, not so much from the definition I have given (though to some extent it may be so understood) as from the general agreement of all, and from the enthusiasm and acts of the best men; they do many a thing for this one reason, that it is becoming, is proper, is right, even though they see no gain likely to follow.</cite> Our Author, on the other side, having little of the <em>Orator,</em> and less of the Constraint of Formality belonging to some graver <em>Characters,</em> can be more familiar on this occasion: and accordingly descending, without the least scruple, into whatever Style, or Humour; he refuses to make the least Difficulty or <em>Mystery</em> of this matter. He pretends, on this head, to claim the Assent not only of <em>Orators, Poets,</em> and the higher <em>Virtuosi,</em> but even of the <em>Beaux</em> themselves, and such as go no farther than the Dancing-Master to seek for <em>Grace</em> and <em>Beauty.</em> He pretends, we see, to fetch this <em>natural Idea</em> from as familiar Amusements as Dress, Equipage, the Tiring-Room, or Toy-shop. And thus in his proper manner of <em>SOLILOQUY,</em> or <em>Self-Discourse,</em> we may imagine him running on: beginning perhaps with some particular <em>Scheme</em> or fansy'd <em>Scale</em> of BEAUTY, which, according to his Philosophy, he strives to erect; by distinguishing, sorting, and dividing into Things <em>animate, in-animate,</em> and <em>mixt:</em> as thus.In the IN-ANIMATE; beginning from those <em>regular Figures</em> and <em>Symmetrys</em> with which Children are delighted; and proceeding gradually to the Proportions of <em>Architecture</em> and the other <em>Arts.</em>—The same in respect of <em>Sounds</em> and MUSICK. From beautiful Stones, Rocks, <em>Minerals;</em> to <em>Vegetables,</em> Woods, aggregate Parts of the World, Seas, Rivers, Mountains, Vales.—The <em>Globe.</em>—Celestial Bodys, and their Order. The higher <em>Architecture</em> of Nature.—NATURE her-self, consider'd as <em>in-animate</em> and <em>passive.</em>In the ANIMATE; from <em>Animals,</em> and their several Kinds, Tempers, Sagacitys, to <em>Men.</em>—And from single <em>Persons</em> of Men, their private <em>Characters,</em> Understandings, <em>Genius's,</em> Dispositions, Manners; to Publick Societys, <em>Communitys,</em> or <em>Commonwealths.</em>—From Flocks, Herds, and other natural <em>Assemblages</em> or <em>Groups</em> of living Creatures, to human Intelligencys and Correspondencys, or whatever is higher in the kind. The Correspondence, Union and Harmony of NATURE her-self, consider'd as <em>animate</em> and intelligent.In the MIXT; as in a <em>single Person,</em> (a Body and a Mind) the Union and Harmony of this kind, which constitutes the real <em>Person:</em> and the Friendship, Love, or whatever other Affection is form'd on such an Object. A <em>Houshold,</em> a <em>City,</em> or <em>Nation,</em> with certain Lands, Buildings, and other Appendices, or local Ornaments, which jointly form that agreeable Idea of <em>Home, Family, Country.</em>—‘‘And what of this?

And of the particular <em>Animal,</em> what Care, and in a manner Idolatry and Consecration; when the Beast beloved is (as often happens) even set apart from use, and only kept to gaze on, and feed the enamour'd Fancy with highest Delight!—See! in another Youth, not so forgetful of <em>Human Kind,</em> but remembring it still in a wrong way! a φιλόκαλος <cite>a lover of the beautiful</cite> of another sort, a CHAEREA. <em>Quàm elegans formarum Spectator!</em>—See as to other <em>Beautys,</em> where there is no Possession, no Enjoyment or Reward, but barely seeing and admiring: as in the <em>Virtuoso</em>-Passion, the Love of <em>Painting,</em> and the <em>Designing</em> Arts of every kind, so often observ'd.—How fares it with our <em>princely Genius,</em> our <em>Grandee</em> who assembles all these <em>Beautys,</em> and within the Bounds of his sumptuous Palace incloses all these Graces of a thousand kinds?—What Pains! Study! Science!—Behold the Disposition and Order of these finer sorts of Apartments, Gardens, <em>Villas!</em>—The kind of Harmony to the Eye, from the various Shapes and Colours agreeably mixt, and rang'd in Lines, intercrossing without confusion, and fortunately co-incident.—A <em>Parterre,</em> Cypresses, Groves, Wildernesses.—Statues, here and there, of <em>Virtue, Fortitude, Temperance.</em>—<em>Heroes</em>-Busts, <em>Philosophers</em>-Heads; with sutable Mottos and Inscriptions.—Solemn Representations of things deeply natural.—<em>Caves, Grottos, Rocks.</em>—<em>Urns</em> and <em>Obelisks</em> in retir'd places, and dispos'd at proper distances and points of Sight: with all those Symmetrys which silently express a reigning <em>Order, Peace, Harmony,</em> and <em>Beauty!</em>—But what is there answerable to this, in the MINDS of <em>the Possessors?</em>—What <em>Possession</em> or <em>Propriety</em> is theirs? What <em>Constancy</em> or <em>Security</em> of Enjoyment? What <em>Peace,</em> what <em>Harmony</em> WITHIN.—Thus our MONOLOGIST, or <em>self-discoursing</em> Author, in his usual Strain; when incited to the Search of BEAUTY and the DECORUM, by vulgar Admiration, and the universal Acknowledgment of the SPECIES in <em>outward</em> Things, and in the <em>meaner</em> and <em>subordinate</em> Subjects. By this inferior <em>Species,</em> it seems, our strict Inspector disdains to be allur'd: And refusing to be captivated by any thing less than the <em>superior, original,</em> and <em>genuine</em> Kind; he walks at leisure, without Emotion, in deep philosophical Reserve, thro' all these pompous Scenes; passes unconcernedly by those Court-Pageants, the illustrious and much-envy'd Potentates of the Place; overlooks <em>the Rich, the Great,</em> and even <em>the Fair:</em> feeling no other Astonishment than what is accidentally rais'd in him, by the View of these Impostures, and of this specious <em>Snare.</em> For here he observes those Gentlemen chiefly to be caught and fastest held, who are the highest Ridiculers of such Reflections as his own; and who in the very height of this Ridicule prove themselves the impotent Contemners of a SPECIES, which, whether they will or no, they ardently pursue: Some, in <em>a Face,</em> and certain regular Lines, or Features: Others, in <em>a Palace and Apartments:</em> Others, in <em>an Equipage</em> and <em>Dress.</em>—<q>O EFFEMINACY! EFFEMINACY! Who wou'd imagine this cou'd be the <em>Vice</em> of such as appear no inconsiderable Men?—But <em>Person</em> is a Subject of Flattery which reaches beyond the Bloom of Youth. The experienc'd Senator and aged General, can, in our days, dispense with a <em>Toilet,</em> and take his outward Form into a very extraordinary Adjustment and Regulation.—All <em>Embellishments</em> are affected, besides the true. And thus, led by Example, whilst we run in search of <em>Elegancy</em> and <em>Neatness;</em> pursuing BEAUTY; and adding, as we imagine, more Lustre, and Value to our own <em>Person;</em> we grow, in our real <em>Character</em> and truer <em>SELF, deform'd</em> and <em>monstrous, servile</em> and <em>abject;</em> stooping to the lowest Terms of Courtship; and sacrificing all internal Proportion, all <em>intrinsick</em> and <em>real</em> BEAUTY and WORTH, for the sake of Things which carry scarce a Shadow of the Kind.</q> <em>Supra,</em> VOL.
