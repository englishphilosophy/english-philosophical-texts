A <em>good</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mind</span> must be paid for, as other things. <q>But we had best beware lest, perhaps, we pay <em>too dear</em> for It.

I am to consider first, <q>What may be <em>their Equivalent?</em> Whether I shall find my Account in letting these <em>inward Concerns</em> run as they please; or Whether I shall not be better secur'd against Fortune by adjusting Matters <em>at home,</em> rather than by making Interest <em>abroad,</em> and acquiring first one great Friend, then another, to add still more and more to my <em>Estate</em> or <em>Qua</em><em>lity?</em></q> For Where am I to take up?
