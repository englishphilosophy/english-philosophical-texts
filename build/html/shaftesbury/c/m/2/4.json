They houl to one another, to bring Company; whether to hunt, or invade their Prey, or assemble on the discovery of a good Carcase. Even the swinish Kinds want not <em>common Affection,</em> and run in Herds to the assistance of their distress'd Fellows. The meaning therefore of this famous Sentence, if it has any meaning at all, must be, <q>That <em>Man is naturally to Man, as a Wolf is to a tamer Creature</em></q>: as, for instance, to <em>a Sheep.</em> But this will be as little to the purpose as to tell us, <q>That there are <em>different</em> Species or Characters of Men; That <em>all</em> have not this<a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> wolfish Nature, but That <em>one half</em> at least are <em>naturally</em> innocent and mild.</q> And thus the Sentence comes to nothing. For without belying <em>Nature,</em> and contradicting what is evident from <em>natural History, Fact,</em> and the plain <em>Course of Things,</em> 'tis impossible to assent to this ill-natur'd Proposition, when we have even done our best to make tolerable sense of it.—But such is Mankind! And even <em>here</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">HumanNature</span> shews it-self, such as it is; not perfect, or absolutely successful, tho rightly tending, <span class=\"margin-comment\">Sect. 5.</span> and mov'd by proper and just Principles. 'Tis <em>here,</em> therefore, <em>in Philosophy,</em> as in the common <em>Conversations</em> of the World. As fond as Men are of <em>Company,</em> and as little able to enjoy any Happiness out of it, they are yet strangely addicted to the way of <em>Satir.</em> And in the same manner, as a <em>malicious Censure</em> craftily worded, and pronounc'd with Assurance, is apt to pass with Mankind for shreud <span class=\"small-capitals\">Wit;</span> so a <em>virulent Maxim</em> in bold Expressions, tho without any Justness of Thought, is readily receiv'd for <em>true</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Philosophy.</span>","subId":"61","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.4.61"},{"type":"note","content":"<em>Vid.</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Locke</span> of human Understanding, <em>Book IV.
