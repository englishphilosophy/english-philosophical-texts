For 'tis not only when Dangers happen, and Hazards are incurr'd, that this sort of <em>Fear</em> oppresses and distracts.

One may safely aver, that by reason of this Passion alone, many a Life, if inwardly and closely view'd, wou'd be found to be thorowly miserable, tho attended with all other Circumstances which in appearance render it happy. But when we add to this, the Meannesses, and base Condescensions, occasion'd by such a passionate Concern for living; when we consider how by means of it we are driven to Actions we can never view without Dislike, and forc'd by degrees from our natural Conduct, into still greater Crookednesses and Perplexity; there is no-one, surely, so disingenuous as not to allow, that <em>Life,</em> in this case, becomes a sorry Purchase, and is pass'd with little Freedom or Satisfaction.

As <em>that</em> is serviceable, in prompting us to shun Danger; so is <em>this,</em> in fortifying us against it, and enabling us to repel Injury, and resist Violence when offer'd. 'Tis true, that according to strict Virtue, and a just Regulation of the Affections in a wise and virtuous Man, such Efforts towards Action amount not to what is justly styl'd <em>Passion</em> or <em>Commotion.</em> A Man of Courage may be cautious without real <em>Fear.</em> And a Man of Temper may resist or punish without <em>Anger.</em> But in ordinary Characters there must necessarily be some Mixture of the real Passions themselves; which however, in the main, are able to allay and temper one another. And thus <span class=\"small-capitals\">Anger</span> in a manner becomes necessary. 'Tis by this Passion that one Creature offering Violence to another, is deter'd from the Execution; whilst he observes how the Attempt affects his Fellow; and knows by the very Signs which accompany this rising Motion, that if the Injury be carry'd further, it will not pass easily, or with impunity. 'Tis this Passion withal, which, after Violence and Hostility executed, rouzes a Creature in opposition, and, assists him in returning like Hostility and Harm on the Invader. For thus, as <em>Rage</em> and <em>Despair</em> increase, a Creature grows still more terrible; and being urg'd to the greatest extremity, finds a degree of Strength and Boldness unexperienc'd till then, and which had never risen, except thro' the height of Provocation. As to this Affection therefore, notwithstanding its immediate Aim be indeed <em>the Ill</em> or Punishment <em>of another,</em> yet it is plainly of the sort of those which tend to the Advantage and Interest of the Self-system, <em>the Animal himself;</em> and is withal in other respects contributing to the Good and Interest of the Species. But there is hardly need we shou'd explain how mischievous and self-destructive <span class=\"small-capitals\">Anger</span> is, if it be what we commonly understand by that word: if it be such a Passion as is rash, and violent in the Instant of Provocation; or such as imprints it-self deeply, and causes a settled <em>Revenge,</em> and an eager vindicative Pursuit. No wonder indeed that so much is done in mere <em>Revenge,</em> and under the Weight of a deep <em>Resentment,</em> when the Relief and Satisfaction found in that Indulgence is no other than the assuaging of the most torturous Pain, and the alleviating the most weighty and pressing Sensation of Misery. The Pain of this sort being for a-while remov'd or alleviated, by the accomplishment of the Desire, in the Ill of another, leaves indeed behind it the perception of a delicious Ease, and an overflowing of soft and pleasing Sensation. Yet is this, in truth, no better than the <em>Rack</em> it-self. For whoever has experienc'd racking Pains, can tell in what manner a sudden Cessation or Respite is us'd to affect him. From hence are those untoward Delights of Perverseness, Frowardness, and an envenom'd malignant Disposition, acting at its liberty. For this is only <em>a perpetual assuaging of</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Anger</span> <em>perpetually renew'd.</em> In other Characters, the <em>Passion</em> arises not so suddenly, or on slight Causes; but being once mov'd, is not so easily quieted. The dormant <em>Fury,</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Revenge</span>, being rais'd once, and wrought up to her highest pitch, rests not till she attains her End; and, that attain'd, is easy, and reposes; making our succeeding Relief and Ease so much the more enjoy'd, as our preceding Anguish and incumbent Pain was of long duration, and bitter sense. Certainly if among <em>Lovers,</em> and in the Language of Gallantry, the Success of ardent Love is call'd the <em>assuaging of a Pain;</em> this other Success may be far more justly term'd so. However soft or flattering the former Pain may be esteem'd, this latter surely can be <em>no pleasing one:</em> Nor can it be possibly esteem'd other than sound and thorow Wretchedness, a grating and disgustful Feeling, without the least mixture of any thing soft, gentle, or agreeable.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not very necessary to mention the ill effects of this Passion, in respect of our <em>Minds,</em> or <em>Bodys,</em> our private Condition, or <em>Circumstances</em> of Life.

They betray us into most Misfortunes, and into the greatest of Unhappinesses, that of a profligate and abject Character. As they grow imperious and high, they are the occasion that a Creature in proportion becomes mean and low. They are original to that which we call <em>Selfishness,</em> and give rise to that sordid Disposition of which we have already spoken.
