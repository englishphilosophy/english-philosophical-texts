This has been the reigning Passion of many Tyrants, and barbarous Nations; and belongs, in some degree, to such Tempers as have thrown off that Courteousness of Behaviour, which retains in us a just Reverence of Mankind, and prevents the Growth of Harshness and Brutality. This Passion enters not where Civility or affable Manners have the least place. Such is the Nature of what we call <em>good Breeding,</em> that in the midst of many other Corruptions, it admits not of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Inhumanity</span>, or <em>savage Pleasure.</em> To see the Sufferance of an Enemy with cruel Delight, may proceed from the height of Anger, Revenge, Fear, and other extended Self-passions: But to delight in the Torture and Pain of other Creatures indifferently, Natives or Foreigners, of our own or of another Species, Kindred or no Kindred, known or unknown; to feed, as it were, on Death, and be entertain'd with dying Agonys; this has nothing in it accountable in the way of Self-interest or private Good above-mention'd, but is wholly and absolutely unnatural, as it is horrid and miserable.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Petulancy.</span> There is another Affection nearly related to this, which is <em>a gay</em> and <em>frolicksome Delight</em> in what is injurious to others; a sort of <span class=\"small-capitals\">wanton Mischievousness</span>, and Pleasure in what is destructive; a Passion which, instead of being restrain'd, is usually encourag'd in Children: so that 'tis indeed no wonder if the Effects of it are very unfortunately felt in the World. For 'twill be hard, perhaps, for any-one to give a reason why that Temper, which was us'd to delight in Disorder and Ravage, when in a Nursery; shou'd not afterwards find delight in other Disturbances, and be the occasion of equal Mischief in Familys, amongst Friends, and in the Publick it-self.

A large share of this belongs to those who have long indulg'd themselves in a habitual <em>Moroseness,</em> or who by force of ill Nature, and ill Breeding, have contracted such a Reverse of Affability, and civil Manners, that to see or meet a Stranger is offensive.

But when these Vices become remarkable in a Character, and arise in a manner from Inclination and Choice; when they are so forward and active, as to appear of their own accord, without any pressing occasion; 'tis apparent they borrow something of the mere <em>unnatural</em> Passions, and are deriv'd from <em>Malice, Envy,</em> and <em>Inveteracy;</em> as explain'd above.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Unnatural Pleasure in general.</span> IT MAY be objected here, that these Passions, <em>unnatural</em> as they are, carry still a sort of <em>Pleasure</em> with them; and that however barbarous a Pleasure it be, yet still it is a Pleasure and <em>Satisfaction</em> which is found in Pride, or Tyranny, Revenge, Malice, or Cruelty exerted. Now if it be possible in Nature, that any-one can feel a barbarous or malicious Joy, otherwise than in consequence of mere Anguish and Torment, then may we perhaps allow this kind of Satisfaction to be call'd <em>Pleasure</em> or <em>Delight.</em> But the Case is evidently contrary. To love, and to be kind; to have social or natural Affection, Complacency and Good-will, is to feel immediate Satisfaction and genuine Content. 'Tis in it-self <em>original Joy,</em> depending on no preceding Pain or Uneasiness; and producing nothing beside Satisfaction merely. On the other side, Animosity, Hatred and Bitterness, is <em>original Misery</em> and <em>Torment,</em> producing no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than as the unnatural Desire is for the instant satisfy'd by something which appeases it. How strong soever this Pleasure, therefore, may appear; it only the more implies the Misery of that State which produces it. For as the cruellest bodily Pains do by intervals of Assuagement, produce (as has been shewn) the highest bodily Pleasure; so the fiercest and most raging Torments of the Mind, do, by certain Moments of Relief, afford the greatest of mental Enjoyments, to those who know little of the truer kind.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.2.2.3.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Unnatural State.</span> The Men of gentlest Dispositions, and best of Tempers, have at some time or other been sufficiently acquainted with those Disturbances, which, at ill hours, even small occasions are apt to raise.

How must it fare, therefore, with those who hardly know any better hours in Life; and who, for the greatest part of it, are agitated by a thorow active Spleen, a close and settled Malignity, and Rancour? How lively must be the Sense of every thwarting and controuling Accident?
