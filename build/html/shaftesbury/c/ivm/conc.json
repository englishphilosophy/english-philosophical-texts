And if there be no Article exceptionable in this Scheme of <em>Moral Arithmetick;</em> the Subject treated may be said to have an Evidence as great as that which is found in Numbers, or Mathematicks. For let us carry <em>Scepticism</em> ever so far, let us doubt, if we can, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes <em>within our-selves.</em> Our Passions and Affections are known to us. <em>They</em> are certain, whatever the <em>Objects</em> may be, on which they are employ'd. Nor is it of any concern to our Argument, how these exterior Objects stand; whether they are Realitys, or mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For <em>ill Dreams</em> will be equally disturbing. And a good <em>Dream,</em> if Life be nothing else, will be easily and happily pass'd. In this Dream of Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our <em>Balance</em> and <em>OEconomy</em> hold good, and our Obligation to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> is in every respect the same.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon the whole: There is not, I presume, the least degree of Certainty wanting in what has been said concerning the Preferableness of <em>the mental Pleasures to the</em> <em>sensual;</em> and even <em>of the sensual, accompany'd with good Affection, and under a temperate and right use,</em> to those which are <em>no ways restrain'd, nor supported by any thing social or affectionate.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.Conc.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor is there less Evidence in what has been said, of <em>the united Structure and Fabrick of the Mind,</em> and of those Passions which constitute <em>the Temper,</em> or Soul; and on which its Happiness or Misery so immediately depend.
