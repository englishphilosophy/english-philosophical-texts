It can never, for instance, make it be thought that the being able to eat Man's Flesh, or commit Bestiality, <em>is good and excellent in it-self.</em> But this is certain, that by means of <em>corrupt Religion,</em> or <span class=\"small-capitals\">Superstition</span>, <span class=\"margin-comment\">Superstition.</span> many things the most horridly unnatural and inhuman, come to be receiv'd as excellent, good, and laudable <em>in themselves.</em>","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.3.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor is this a wonder.

But this is what Religion, in the main, forbids us to imagine. It everywhere prescribes Esteem and Honour in company with Worship and Adoration.
