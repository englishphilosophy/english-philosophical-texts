A Soul, indeed, may as well be without <em>Sense,</em> as without Admiration in the Things of which it has any knowledg.

If there be no <em>real</em> Amiableness or Deformity in moral Acts, there is at least <em>an imaginary one</em> of full force. Tho perhaps the Thing itself shou'd not be allow'd in Nature, the Imagination or Fancy of it must be allow'd to be from Nature alone.
