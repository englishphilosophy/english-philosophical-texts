But if the Affection be then only injurious to the Society, when it is immoderate, and not so when it is moderate, duly temper'd, and allay'd; then is <em>the immoderate</em> degree of the Affection truly vitious, but not <em>the moderate.</em> And thus, if there be found in any Creature a more than ordinary Self-concernment, or Regard to private Good, which is inconsistent with the Interest of the Species or Publick; this must in every respect be esteem'd an ill and vitious Affection.

And this no-one wou'd doubt to pronounce, if he saw a Man who minded not any Precipices which lay in his way, nor made any distinction of Food, Diet, Clothing, or whatever else related to his Health and Being. The same wou'd be aver'd of one who had a Disposition which render'd him averse to any Commerce with Womankind, and of consequence unfitted him thro' <em>Illness of Temper</em> (and not merely thro' <em>a Defect of Constitution</em>) for the propagation of his Species or Kind.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus the Affection towards Self-good, may be a good Affection, or an ill-one. For if this private Affection be too strong, (as when the <em>excessive Love of Life</em> unfits a Creature for any generous Act) then is it undoubtedly vitious; and if vitious, the Creature who is mov'd by it, is vitiously mov'd, and can never be otherwise than vitious in some degree, when mov'd by that Affection. Therefore if thro' such an earnest and passionate <em>Love of Life,</em> a Creature be accidentally induc'd to do Good, (as he might be upon the same terms induc'd to do <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ill</span>) he is no more a good Creature for this Good he executes, than a Man is the more an honest or good Man either for pleading a just Cause, or fighting in a good one, for the sake merely of his Fee or Stipend.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whatsoever therefore is done which happens to be advantageous to the Species, thro' an Affection merely towards Self-good, does not imply any more Goodness in the Creature than as the Affection it-self is good. Let him, in any particular, act ever so well; if at the bottom, it be that selfish Affection alone which moves him; he is in himself still vitious. Nor can any Creature be consider'd otherwise, when the Passion towards Self-good, tho ever so moderate, is his real Motive in the doing that, to which a natural Affection for his Kind ought by right to have inclin'd him.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Temper.</span> And indeed whatever exterior Helps or Succours an ill-dispos'd Creature may find, to push him on towards the performance of any one good Action; there can no Goodness arise in him, till his <em>Temper</em> be so far chang'd, that in the issue he comes in earnest to be led by some immediate Affection, <em>directly,</em> and not <em>accidentally,</em> to Good, and against Ill.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For instance; if one of those Creatures suppos'd to be by Nature tame, gentle, and favourable to Mankind, be, contrary to his natural Constitution, fierce and savage; we instantly remark the Breach of <em>Temper,</em> and own the Creature to be unnatural and corrupt.
