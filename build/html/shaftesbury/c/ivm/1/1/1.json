And so willing we are to believe well of their <em>Union,</em> that we hardly allow it just to speak, or even think of 'em apart. It may however be question'd, whether the Practice of the World, in this respect, be answerable to our Speculation. 'Tis certain that we sometimes meet with Instances which seem to make against this general Supposition. We have known People, who having the Appearance of great Zeal in <em>Religion,</em> have yet wanted even the common Affections of <em>Humanity,</em> and shewn themselves extremely degenerate and corrupt. Others, again, who have paid little regard to Religion, and been consider'd as mere <span class=\"small-capitals\">Atheists</span>, have yet been observ'd to practice the Rules of <em>Morality,</em> and act in many Cases with such good Meaning and Affection towards Mankind, as might seem to force an Acknowledgment of their being <em>virtuous.</em> And, in general, we find mere moral Principles of such weight, that in our dealings with Men, we are seldom satisfy'd by the fullest Assurance given us of their Zeal in Religion, till we hear something further of their Character. If we are told, a Man is religious; we still ask, <q>What are his Morals?</q> But if we hear at first that he has honest moral Principles, and is a Man of natural Justice and good Temper, we seldom think of the other Question, <q>Whether he be <em>religious</em> and <em>devout?</em></q>","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.1.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This has given occasion to enquire, <q>What <em>Honesty</em> or <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> is, consider'd by it-self; and in what manner it is influenc'd by Religion: How far <em>Religion</em> necessarily implies <em>Virtue;</em> and whether it be a true Saying, <em>That it is impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous, or share any real degree of Honesty, or</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Merit</span>.</q>","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.1.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And here it cannot justly be wonder'd at, if the <em>Method</em> of explaining Things shou'd appear somewhat unusual; since the <em>Subject-Matter</em> has been so little examin'd, and is of so nice and dangerous Speculation. For so much is the religious part of Mankind alarm'd by the Freedom of some late Pens; and so great a Jealousy is rais'd every-where on this Account; that whatever an Author may suggest in favour of <em>Religion,</em> he will gain little Credit in the Cause, if he allows the least Advantage to any other Principle. On the other side, the Men of Wit and Raillery, whose pleasantest Entertainment is in the exposing the weak sides of Religion, are so desperately afraid of being drawn into any serious Thoughts of it, that they look upon a Man as guilty of foul Play, who assumes the air of a <em>Free Writer,</em> and at the same time preserves any regard for the Principles of Natural Religion. They are apt to give as little quarter as they receive: And are resolv'd to think as ill of the Morals of their Antagonists, as their Antagonists can possibly think of theirs. Neither of 'em, it seems, will allow the least Advantage to the other. 'Tis as hard to persuade one sort, that there is any Virtue in Religion, as the other, that there is any Virtue out of the Verge of their particular Community. So that, between both, an Author must past his time ill, who dares plead for <em>Religion</em> and <em>Moral Virtue,</em> without lessening the force of either; but allowing to each its proper Province, and due Rank, wou'd hinder their being made Enemys by Detraction.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.1.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"However it be: If we wou'd pretend to give the least new light, or explain any thing effectually, within the intended Compass of this <em>Inquiry;</em> 'tis necessary to take Things pretty deep; and endeavour, by some short Scheme, to represent the Original of each Opinion, whether natural or unnatural, relating to the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Deity</span>. And if we can happily get clear of this thorny part of our Philosophy; the rest, 'tis hop'd, may prove more plain and easy.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.1.1.4"}]}
