She may be <em>habited</em> either as an <span class=\"small-capitals\">Amazon</span>, with the Helmet, Lance, and in the Robe or Vest of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pallas</span>; or as any other of the <em>Virtues, Goddesses,</em> or <em>Heroines,</em> with the plain original Crown, without Rays, according to genuine Antiquity. Our History makes no mention of a Helmet, or any other Armour of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span>. It gives us only to understand, that she was dress'd neither negligently, nor with much study or ornament. If we follow this latter method, we need give her only in her hand the Imperial or<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Magisterial Sword; which is her true characteristick Mark, and wou'd sufficiently distinguish her, without the Helmet, Lance, or other military Habit. And in this manner, the opposition between her-self and her Rival wou'd be still more beautiful and regular.—<q>But this Beauty, says one, wou'd be discoverable only by the Learned.</q>—Perhaps so. But then again, there wou'd be no loss for others: since no-one wou'd find this Piece the less intelligible on the account of this Regulation. On the contrary, one who chanc'd to know little of Antiquity in general, or of this History in particular, wou'd be still further to seek, if upon seeing an armed Woman in the Piece, he shou'd represent to himself either a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pallas</span>, a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Bellona</span>, or any other warlike Form, or Deity of the female kind.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.)

The Historian whom we follow, represents <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> to us as a Lady of a goodly Form, tall and majestick. And by what he relates of her, he gives us sufficiently to understand, that tho she was neither lean, nor of a tann'd Complexion, she must have discover'd however, by the Substance and Colour of her Flesh, that she was sufficiently accustom'd to exercise. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span>, on the other hand, by an exact Opposition, is represented in better case, and of a Softness of Complexion; which speaks her Manners, and gives her a middle Character between the Person of a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Venus</span>, and that of a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Bacchinal</span> <em>Nymph.</em>","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(5.)

In this view, she shou'd be so design'd, as to stand firm with her full poise upon one foot, having the other a little advanc'd, and rais'd on a broken piece of ground or rock, instead of the Helmet or little Globe on which we see her usually setting her foot, as triumphant, in those Pieces of the <em>emblematick</em> kind. A particular advantage of this Attitude, so judiciously assign'd to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> by antient Masters, is, that it expresses as well her aspiring Effort, or Ascent towards the Stars and Heaven, as her Victory and Superiority over Fortune and the World. For so the Poets have, of old, describ'd her.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>Attempts a course by a path denied. <br><a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>And deserts the path of difficult virtue.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And in our Piece particularly, where the <em>arduous</em> and <em>rocky way</em> of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> requires to be emphatically represented; the ascending Posture of this Figure, with one Foot advanc'd, in a sort of climbing Action, over the rough and thorny Ground, must of necessity, if well executed, create a due effect, and add to the Sublime of this<a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> antient <em>Poetick</em> Work.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(6.) As for the <em>Hands</em> or <em>Arms,</em> which in real Oratory, and during the strength of Elocution, must of necessity be active; 'tis plain in respect of our Goddess, that the Arm in particular which she has free to her-self, and is neither incumber'd with Lance or Sword, shou'd be employ'd another way, and come in, to second the Discourse, and accompany it, with a just Emphasis and Action. Accordingly, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span> wou'd then be seen with this Hand, turn'd either <em>upwards</em> to the rocky Way mark'd out by her with approbation; or to the Sky, or Stars, in the same sublime sense; or <em>downwards</em> to the flowery Way and Vale, as in a detesting manner, and with abhorrence of what passes there; or last of all (in a disdainful sense, and with the same appearance of Detestation) against <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span> herself. Each Manner wou'd have its peculiar advantage. And the best Profit shou'd be made of this Arm and Hand at liberty, to express either the <em>Disapprobation</em> or the <em>Applause</em> propos'd. It might prove, however, a considerable advantage to our Figure of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span>, if holding the Lance, or Imperial Sword, slightly, with one of her Hands stretch'd downwards, she cou'd, by that very Hand and Action, be made to express <em>the latter</em> meaning; opening for that purpose some of the lower Fingers of this Hand, in a refusing or repelling manner; whilst with the other Arm and Hand at liberty, she shou'd express as well <em>the former</em> meaning, and point out to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hercules</span> the way which leads to Honour, and the just Glory of heroick Actions.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(7.) From all these Circumstances of History, and Action, accompanying this important Figure, the difficulty of the Design will sufficiently appear, to those who carry their Judgment beyond the <em>mere Form,</em> and are able to consider the Character of the Passion to which it is subjected. For where a real Character is mark'd, and <em>the inward Form</em> peculiarly describ'd, 'tis necessary <em>the outward</em> shou'd give place. Whoever shou'd expect to see our Figure of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span>, in the exact Mein of a <em>fine Talker,</em> curious in her Choice of Action, and forming it according to the usual Decorum, and regular Movement of one of the fair Ladys of our Age, wou'd certainly be far wide of the Thought and Genius of this Piece. Such study'd Action, and artificial Gesture, may be allow'd to the Actors and Actrices of the Stage. But the good Painter must come a little nearer to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Truth</span>, and take care that his Action be not <em>theatrical,</em> or at second hand; but <em>original,</em> and drawn from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Nature</span> her-self. Now altho in the ordinary Tenour of Discourse, the Action of the Party might be allow'd to appear so far govern'd and compos'd by Art, as to retain that regular <em>Contraste,</em> and nice Balance of Movement, which Painters are apt to admire as the chief Grace of Figures; yet in this particular case, where the natural Eagerness of Debate, supported by a thorow Antipathy and Animosity, is join'd to a sort of <em>enthusiastick Agitation</em> incident to our prophetick Dame, there can be little of that fashionable Mein, or genteel Air admitted. The Painter who, in such a Piece as we describe, is bound to preserve the heroick Style, will doubtless beware of representing his Heroine as a mere <em>Scold.</em> Yet this is certain, That it were better for him to expose himself to the Meanness of such a Fancy, and paint his Lady in a high Rant, according to the common Weakness of the Sex, than to engage in the Embelishment of the mere <em>Form;</em> and, forgetting the Character of Severity and Reprimand belonging to the illustrious Rival, present her to us a fair specious Personage, free of Emotion, and without the least Bent or Movement, which shou'd express the real <em>Pathetick</em> of the kind.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.9"},{"type":"note","content":"Parazonium.","subId":"n1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.3.n1"},{"type":"note","content":"——<em>Negatâ tentat iter viâ.</em> Horat.
