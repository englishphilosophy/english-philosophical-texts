Accordingly we are to understand, that it is not merely the Shape or Dimension of a Cloth, or Board, which denominates the <em>Piece</em> or <em>Tablature;</em> since a Work of this kind may be compos'd of any colour'd Substance, as it may of any Form; whether square, oval or round. But 'tis then that in Painting we may give to any particular Work the Name of <em>Tablature,</em> when the Work is in reality <q><em>a Single Piece,</em> comprehended in one <em>View,</em> and form'd according to <em>one single</em> Intelligence, Meaning, or Design; which constitutes a <em>real</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Whole</span>, by a mutual and necessary Relation of its Parts, the same as of the Members in a natural Body.</q> So that one may say of a Picture compos'd of any number of Figures differently rang'd, and without any regard to this Correspondency or Union describ'd, That it is no more a real <em>Piece</em> or <em>Tablature,</em> than a Picture wou'd be a Man's <em>Picture,</em> or proper <em>Portraiture,</em> which represented on the same Cloth, in different places, the Legs, Arms, Nose, and Eyes of such a Person, without adjusting them according to the true Proportion, Air, and Character which belong'd to him.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.Intro.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(3.) This Regulation has place even in the inferior degrees of Painting; since the mere Flower-Painter is, we see, oblig'd to study the Form of <em>Festons,</em> and to make use of a peculiar Order, or Architecture of <em>Vases, Jars, Cannisters, Pedestals,</em> and other Inventions, which serve as <em>Machines,</em> to frame a certain proportionate Assemblage, or united Mass; according to the Rules of Perspective; and with regard as well to the different shapes and sizes of his several Flowers, as to the harmony of Colours resulting from the whole: this being the only thing capable of rendering his Work worthy the name of a <em>Composition</em> or <em>real Piece.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.Intro.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.) So much the more, therefore, is this Regulation applicable to <em>History-Painting,</em> where not only <em>Men,</em> but <em>Manners,</em> and human Passions are represented.

'Tis on the issue of the Controversy between these <em>Two,</em> that the Character of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hercules</span> depends.
