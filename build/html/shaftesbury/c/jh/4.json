The Truth of <em>Appearance,</em> that of <em>History,</em> and even the <em>Decorum</em> it-self, (according to what has been explain'd above) require evidently that in this Period or Instant describ'd, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span> shou'd be found silent. She can have no other Language allow'd her than that merely of <em>the Eyes.</em> And 'twou'd be a happy Management for her in the Design, if in turning her Eyes to meet those of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hercules</span>, she shou'd find his Head and Face already turn'd so much on the contrary side, as to shew it impossible for her as yet to discover the growing Passion of this Hero in favour of her Rival. By this means she might still with good right retain her fond Airs of Dalliance and Courtship; as having yet discover'd no reason she has to be dissatisfy'd.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(2.) She may be drawn either <em>standing, leaning, sitting,</em> or <em>lying;</em> without a Crown, or crown'd either with Roses, or with Myrtle; according to the Painter's Fancy. And since in this <em>third</em> Figure the Painter has so great a liberty left him, he may make good advantage of it for the other <em>two,</em> to which <em>this latter</em> may be subjected, as the last in order, and of least consequence.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(3.) That which makes the greatest difficulty in the Disposition or Ordonnance of this Figure <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span>, is, that notwithstanding the supine Air and Character of Ease and Indolence, which shou'd be given her, she must retain still so much Life and Action, as is sufficient to express her <em>persuasive Effort,</em> and Manner of <em>Indication</em> towards her proper Paths; those of the flowery kind, and Vale below, whither she wou'd willingly guide our Hero's steps. Now shou'd this <em>Effort</em> be over-strongly express'd; not only the supine Character and Air of Indolence wou'd be lost in this Figure of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span>; but, what is worse, the Figure wou'd seem to speak, or at least appear so, as to create a double Meaning, or <em>equivocal Sense</em> in Painting: which wou'd destroy what we have establish'd as fundamental, concerning the absolute Reign of <em>Silence</em> thro'out the rest of the Piece, in favour of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Virtue</span>, the sole speaking Party at this Instant, or third Period of our History.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(4.) According to a Computation, which in this way of Reasoning might be made, of the whole <em>Motion</em> or <em>Action</em> to be given to our Figure of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pleasure</span>; she shou'd scarce have <em>one fifth</em> reserv'd for that which we may properly call <em>active</em> in her, and have already term'd her <em>persuasive</em> or <em>indicative Effort.</em> All besides shou'd be employ'd to express, if one may say so, her <em>Inaction,</em> her <em>Supineness, Effeminacy,</em> and <em>indulgent Ease.</em> The Head and Body might intirely favour this latter Passion. One Hand might be absolutely resign'd to it; serving only to support, with much ado, the lolling lazy Body. And if the other Hand be requir'd to express some kind of Gesture or Action toward the Road of Pleasures recommended by this Dame; the Gesture ought however to be slight and negligent, in the manner of one who has given over speaking, and appears weary and spent.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.JH.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"(5.)
