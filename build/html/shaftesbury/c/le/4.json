And my Notion is, that provided we treat Religion with good Manners, we can never use too much <em>good Humour</em>, or examine it with too much <em>Freedom</em> and <em>Familiarity</em>. For, if it be genuine and sincere, it will not only stand the Proof, but thrive and gain advantage from hence: if it be spurious, or mix'd with any Imposture, it will be detected and expos'd.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The melancholy way in which we have been taught Religion, makes us unapt to think of it in good Humour. 'Tis in Adversity chiefly, or in ill Health, under Affliction, or Disturbance of Mind, or Discomposure of Temper, that we have recourse to it. Tho in reality we are never so unfit to think of it as at such a heavy and dark hour. We can never be fit to contemplate any thing above us, when we are in no condition to look into ourselves, and calmly examine the Temper of our own Mind and Passions. For then it is we see Wrath, and Fury, and Revenge, and Terrors <em>in the</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Deity</span>; when we are full of Disturbances and Fears <em>within</em>, and have, by Sufferance and Anxiety, lost so much of the natural Calm and Easiness of our Temper.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We must not only be in ordinary good Humour, but in the best of Humours, and in the sweetest, kindest Disposition of our Lives, to understand well what <em>true Goodness</em> is, and what those <em>Attributes</em> imply, which we ascribe with such Applause and Honour to <em>the</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Deity</span>. We shall then be able to see best, whether those Forms of Justice, those Degrees of Punishment, that Temper of Resentment, and those Measures of Offence and Indignation, which we vulgarly suppose in <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>, are sutable to those original Ideas of <em>Goodness</em>, which the same Divine Being, or Nature under him, has implanted in us, and which we must necessarily presuppose, in order to give him Praise or Honour in any kind. This, my Lord, is the Security against all Superstition: To remember, that there is nothing in <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span> but what is <em>God-like</em>; and that He is either <em>not at all</em>, or <em>truly and perfectly Good</em>. But when we are afraid to use our Reason freely, even on that very Question, <q>Whether He really <em>be</em>, or <em>not</em></q>; we then actually presume him <em>bad</em>, and flatly contradict that pretended Character of Goodness and Greatness; whilst we discover this Mistrust of his Temper, and fear his Anger and Resentment, in the case of this <em>Freedom of</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Inquiry</span>.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We have a notable Instance of this <em>Freedom</em> in one of our sacred Authors. As patient as <span class=\"small-capitals\">Job</span> is said to be, it cannot be denied that he makes bold enough with <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>, and takes his Providence roundly to task. His Friends, indeed, plead hard with him, and use all Arguments, right or wrong, to patch up Objections, and set the Affairs of Providence upon an equal foot. They make a merit of saying all the Good they can of <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>, at the very stretch of their Reason, and sometimes quite beyond it. But this, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Job</span>'s opinion, is<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <em>flattering</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>, <em>accepting of</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>'s <em>Person</em>, and even <em>mocking him</em>. And no wonder. For, what merit can there be in believing <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>, or his <em>Providence</em>, upon frivolous and weak grounds? What Virtue in assuming an Opinion contrary to the appearance of Things, and resolving to hear nothing which may be said against it? Excellent Character of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span> <em>of Truth</em>! that he shou'd be offended at us, for having refus'd to put the lye upon our Understandings, as much as in us lay; and be satisfy'd with us for having believ'd at a venture, and against our Reason, what might have been the greatest Falshood in the world, for any thing we cou'd bring as a Proof or Evidence to the contrary!","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is impossible that any besides an ill-natur'd Man can wish against the Being of a <span class=\"small-capitals\">God</span>: for this is wishing against the Publick, and even against one's private Good too, if rightly understood.

This is being <em>Sycophants</em> in Religion, mere <em>Parasites</em> of Devotion.

And shou'd we not pass for extravagantly morose and ill-humour'd, if instead of treating the matter <em>in Raillery</em>, we shou'd think in earnest of <em>revenging our-selves</em> on the offending Partys, who, out of their rustick Ignorance, ill Judgment, or Incredulity, had detracted from our Renown?","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.4.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How shall we say then?
