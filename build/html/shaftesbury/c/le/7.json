For, as some have well remark'd, there have been <em>Enthusiastical Atheists</em>. Nor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily distinguish'd from it. For Inspiration is <em>a real</em> feeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm <em>a false one</em>. But the Passion they raise is much alike. For when the Mind is taken up in Vision, and fixes its view either on any real Object, or mere Specter of Divinity; when it sees, or thinks it sees any thing prodigious, and more than human; its Horror, Delight, Confusion, Fear, Admiration, or whatever Passion belongs to it, or is uppermost on this occasion, will have something vast, <em>immane</em>, and (as Painters say) <em>beyond Life</em>. And this is what gave occasion to the name of <em>Fanaticism</em>, as it was us'd by the Antients in its original Sense, for an <em>Apparition</em> transporting the Mind.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.LE.7.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Something there will be of Extravagance and Fury, when the Ideas or Images receiv'd are too big for the narrow human Vessel to contain. So that <em>Inspiration</em> may be justly call'd <em>Divine</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Enthusiasm</span>: For the Word it-self signifies <em>Divine Presence</em>, and was made use of by the Philosopher whom the earliest Christian Fathers call'd <em>Divine</em>, to express whatever was sublime in human Passions<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This was the Spirit he allotted to <em>Heroes, Statesmen, Poets, Orators, Musicians</em>, and even <em>Philosophers</em> themselves. Nor can we, of our own accord, forbear ascribing to a<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> noble <span class=\"small-capitals\">Enthusiasm</span>, whatever is greatly perform'd by any of <em>These</em>. So that almost all of us know something of this Principle. But to know it as we shou'd do, and discern it in its several kinds, both in our-selves, and others; this is the great Work, and by this means alone we can hope to avoid Delusion. For <em>to judg the Spirits whether they are of God</em>, we must antecedently <em>judg our own Spirit</em>; whether it be of <em>Reason</em> and <em>sound Sense</em>; whether it be fit to <em>judg</em> at all, by being sedate, cool, and impartial; free of every biassing Passion, every giddy Vapor, or melancholy Fume. This is the first Knowledg and previous Judgment: <q>To understand <em>our-selves</em>, and know <em>what Spirit we are of</em>.</q> Afterwards we may judg the <em>Spirit</em> in others, consider what their personal Merit is, and prove the Validity of their Testimony by the Solidity of their Brain. By this means we may prepare our-selves with some <em>Antidote</em> against Enthusiasm.
