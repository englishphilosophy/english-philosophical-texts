In this Banishment from Letters and Discourse, the Man very wittily invented an Amusement much to his purpose, and highly preservative both of Health and Humour. It may be thought perhaps, that of all Seasons or Circumstances here was one the most sutable to our oft-mention'd practice of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Soliloquy;</span> especially since the Prisoner was one of those whom in this Age we usually call <em>Philosophers,</em> a Successor of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Paracelsus,</span> and a Master in the occult Sciences. But as to <em>Moral</em> Science, or any thing relating to <em>Self-converse,</em> he was a mere Novice. To work therefore he went, after a different method. He tun'd his natural Pipes not after the manner of a Musician, to practice what was melodious and agreeable in Sounds, but to fashion and form all sorts of articulate Voices the most distinctly that was possible. This he perform'd by strenuously exalting his Voice, and essaying it in all the several Dispositions and Configurations of his Throat and Mouth. And thus bellowing, roaring, snarling, and otherwise variously exerting his Organs of Sound, he endeavour'd to discover what Letters of the Alphabet cou'd best design each Species, or what new Letters were to be invented, to mark the undiscover'd Modifications. He found, for instance, the Letter <em>A</em> to be a most genuine Character, an original and pure Vowel, and justly plac'd as principal in the front of the alphabetick Order. For having duly extended his under Jaw to its utmost distance from the upper; and by a proper Insertion of his Fingers provided against the Contraction of either Corner of his Mouth; he experimentally discover'd it impossible for human Tongue under these Circumstances to emit any other Modification of Sound than that which was describ'd by this primitive Character. The Vowel <em>O</em> was form'd by an orbicular Disposition of the Mouth; as was aptly delineated in the Character it-self. The Vowel <em>U</em> by a parallel Protrusion of the Lips. The other Vowels and Consonants by other various Collisions of the Mouth, and Operations of the active Tongue upon the passive Gum or Palat. The Result of this profound Speculation and long Exercise of our Prisoner, was <em>a Philosophical Treatise,</em> which he compos'd when he was set at liberty. He esteem'd himself the only Master of Voice and Language on the account of this his <em>radical</em> Science, and <em>fundamental Knowledg</em> of Sounds.
