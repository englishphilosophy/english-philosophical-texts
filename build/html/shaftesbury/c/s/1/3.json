Of the former kind are either those good <em>Rusticks,</em> who have been bred remote from the form'd Societys of Men; or those plain <em>Artizans,</em> and People of lower Rank, who living in Citys and Places of resort, have been necessitated however to follow mean Imployments, and wanted the Opportunity and Means to form themselves after the better Models. There are some Persons indeed so happily form'd by Nature her-self, that with the greatest Simplicity or Rudeness of Education, they have still something of a natural Grace and Comeliness in their Action: And there are others of a better Education, who by a wrong Aim and injudicious Affectation of Grace, are of all People the farthest remov'd from it. 'Tis undeniable however, that the Perfection of Grace and Comeliness in Action and Behaviour, can be found only among the People of a liberal Education.

They were Pieces which, besides their force of Style, and hidden Numbers, carry'd a sort of <em>Action</em> and <em>Imitation,</em> the same as the <em>Epick</em> and <em>Dramatick</em> kinds. They were either real <em>Dialogues,</em> or Recitals of such <em>personated Discourses;</em> where the Persons themselves had their Characters preserv'd thro'out; their Manners, Humours, and distinct Turns of Temper and Understanding maintain'd, according to the most exact <em>poetical Truth.</em> 'Twas not enough that these Pieces treated fundamentally of <em>Morals,</em> and in consequence pointed out <em>real Characters</em> and <em>Manners:</em> They exhibited 'em <em>alive,</em> and set the Countenances and Complexions of Men plainly in view. And by this means they not only taught Us to know <em>Others;</em> but, what was principal and of highest virtue in 'em, they taught us to know <em>Our-selves.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Philosophical <em>Hero</em> of these Poems, whose Name they carry'd both in their Body and Front, and whose Genius and Manner they were made to represent, was in himself <em>a perfect Character;</em> yet, in some respects, so veil'd, and in a Cloud, that to the unattentive Surveyor he seem'd often to be very different from what he really was: and this chiefly by reason of a certain exquisite and refin'd Raillery which belong'd to his Manner, and by virtue of which he cou'd treat the highest Subjects, and those of the commonest Capacity both together, and render 'em explanatory of each other. So that in this Genius of writing, there appear'd both <em>the heroick</em> and <em>the simple, the tragick,</em> and <em>the comick Vein.</em> However, it was so order'd, that notwithstanding the Oddness or Mysteriousness of the principal Character, the <em>Under-parts</em> or <em>second Characters</em> shew'd human Nature more distinctly, and to the Life. We might here, therefore, as in a <em>Looking-Glass,</em> discover our-selves, and see our minutest Features nicely delineated, and suted to our own Apprehension and Cognizance. No-one who was ever so little a-while an Inspector, cou'd fail of becoming acquainted with his own Heart. And, what was of singular note in these <em>magical Glasses,</em> it wou'd happen, that by constant and long Inspection, the Partys accustom'd to the Practice, wou'd acquire a peculiar <em>speculative Habit;</em> so as virtually to carry about with 'em a sort of <em>Pocket-Mirrour,</em> always ready, and in use. In this, there were <em>Two</em> Faces which wou'd naturally present themselves to our view: <em>One</em> of them, like the commanding Genius, the Leader and Chief above-mention'd; the <em>other</em> like that rude, undisciplin'd and headstrong Creature, whom we our-selves in our natural Capacity most exactly resembled. Whatever we were employ'd in, whatever we set about; if once we had acquir'd the habit of this <em>Mirrour;</em> we shou'd, by virtue of the double Reflection, distinguish our-selves into two different Partys.

Their <em>Mimes</em> or characteriz'd Discourses were as much relish'd, as their most regular Poems; and were the Occasion perhaps that so many of these latter were form'd in such perfection. For Poetry it-self was defin'd <em>an Imitation</em> chiefly of Men and Manners: and was that in an exalted and noble degree, which in a low one we call <em>Mimickry.</em> 'Tis in this that the great<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <em>Mimographer,</em> the Father and Prince of Poets, excels so highly; his Characters being wrought to a Likeness beyond what any succeeding Masters were ever able to describe. Nor are his Works, which are so full of Action, any other than an artful Series or Chain of <em>Dialogues,</em> which turn upon <em>one</em> remarkable <em>Catastrophe</em> or Event. He describes no Qualitys or Virtues; censures no Manners: makes no Encomiums, nor gives Characters himself; but brings his Actors still in view. 'Tis they who shew themselves. 'Tis they who speak in such a manner, as distinguishes 'em in all things from all others, and makes 'em ever like themselves. Their different Compositions and Allays so justly made, and equally carry'd on, thro' every particle of the Action, give more Instruction than all the Comments or Glosses in the world. The Poet, instead of giving himself those dictating and masterly Airs of Wisdom, makes hardly any figure at all, and is scarce discoverable in his Poem. This is being truly <em>a Master.</em> He paints so as to need no Inscription over his Figures, to tell us what they are, or what he intends by 'em. A few words let fall, on any slight occasion, from any of the Partys he introduces, are sufficient to denote their Manners and distinct Character. From a Finger or a Toe, he can represent to our Thoughts the Frame and Fashion of a whole Body. He wants no other help of Art, to personate his Heroes, and make 'em living. There was no more left for <em>Tragedy</em> to do after him, than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into Scenes; turning, in the same manner, upon one principal Action or Event, with that regard to Place and Time which was sutable to a real Spectacle. Even<a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <em>Comedy</em> it-self was adjudg'd to this great Master; it being deriv'd from those <em>Parodys</em> or Mock-Humours, of which he had given the<a href=\"#n5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Specimen in a conceal'd sort of Raillery intermix'd with the Sublime.—A dangerous Stroke of Art! and which requir'd a masterly Hand, like that of the philosophical Hero, whose Character was represented in the <em>Dialogue-Writings</em> above-mention'd.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.1.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From hence possibly we may form a Notion of that Resemblance, which on so many occasions was heretofore remark'd between the Prince of Poets, and the Divine Philosopher, who was said to rival him, and who together with his Contemporarys of the same School, writ wholly in that manner of <em>Dialogue</em> above-describ'd.

As for Poets in particular, says the learned and wise <span class=\"small-capitals\">Strabo,</span> <q>Can we possibly imagine, that the Genius, Power, and Excellence of a real <em>Poet</em> consists in aught else than the just <em>Imitation</em> of Life, in form'd Discourse and Numbers? But how shou'd he be that just <em>Imitator</em> of Life, whilst he himself knows not its Measures, nor how to guide himself by Judgment and Understanding? For we have not surely the same Notion of the Poet's Excellence as of the ordinary Craftsman's, the Subject of whose Art is sensless Stone or Timber, without Life, Dignity, or Beauty: whilst the Poet's Art turning principally on Men and Manners, he has his Virtue and Excellence, <em>as Poet,</em> naturally annex'd to human Excellence, and to the Worth and Dignity of Man. Insomuch that 'tis impossible he shou'd be a great and worthy Poet, who is not first a worthy and good Man.</q> <span class=\"foreign\">οὐ γάρ οὕτω φαμὲν τὴν τω̑ν ποιητω̑ν ἀρετὴν ὡς ἢ τεκτόνων ἢ χαλκέων, &amp;c. ἡ δὲ ποιητου̑ συνέζευκται τῃ̑ του̑ ἀνθρώπου. καὶ οὐχ οι̑όν τὲ ἀγαθὸν γενέσθαι ποιητὴν, μὴ πρότερον γενηθέντα ἄνδρα ἀγαθόν—.</span>  Lib. 1.
