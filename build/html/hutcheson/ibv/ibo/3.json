Thus for instance, the 47<em>th</em> Proposition of the first <em>Book</em> of <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Euclid</span></span>'s <cite>Elements</cite> contains an infinite Multitude of Truths, concerning the infinite possible <em>Sizes</em> of right-angled <em>Triangles</em>, as you make the <em>Area</em> greater or less; and in each of these <em>Sizes</em> you may find an infinite Multitude of dissimilar <em>Triangles</em>, as you vary the Proportion of the <em>Base</em> to the <em>Perpendicular</em>; all which Infinitys of Infinites agree in the general <em>Theorem</em>. In <em>Algebraick</em>, and <em>Fluxional Calculations</em>, we shall still find a greater <em>Variety</em> of particular <em>Truths</em> included in general <em>Theorems</em>; not only in general <em>Equations</em> applicable to all Kinds of <em>Quantity</em>, but in more particular Investigations of <em>Areas</em> and <em>Tangents</em>: In which one Manner of Operation shall discover <em>Theorems</em> applicable to infinite <em>Orders</em> or <em>Species</em> of <em>Curves</em>, to the infinite <em>Sizes</em> of each Species, and to the infinite <em>Points</em> of the infinite <em>Individuals</em> of each Size.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Foundation of their Beauty.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">That</span> we may the better discern this Agreement, or <em>Unity</em> of an Infinity of Objects, in the general <em>Theorem</em>, to be the Foundation of the <em>Beauty</em> or <em>Pleasure</em> attending their Discovery, let us compare our Satisfaction in such Discoveries, with the uneasy state of Mind in which we are, when we can only measure Lines, or Surfaces, by a Scale, or are making Experiments which we can reduce to no general <em>Canon</em>, but only heaping up a Multitude of particular incoherent Observations. Now each of these Trials discovers a new Truth, but with no Pleasure or <em>Beauty</em>, notwithstanding the <em>Variety</em>, till we can discover some sort of <em>Unity</em>, or reduce them to some general Canon.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Little Beauty in Axioms.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Again</span>, let us take a Metaphysical Axiom, such as this, <em>Every Whole is greater than its Part</em>; and we shall find no <em>Beauty</em> in the Contemplation. For tho' this Proposition contains many Infinitys of particular Truths; yet the <em>Unity</em> is inconsiderable, since they all agree only in a vague, undetermin'd Conception of <em>Whole</em> and <em>Part</em>, and in an indefinite Excess of the former above the latter, which is sometimes great and sometimes small. So, should we hear that the <em>Cylinder</em> is greater than the inscrib'd <em>Sphere</em>, and this again greater than the <em>Cone</em> of the same Altitude and Diameter with the Base, we shall find no pleasure in this Knowledge of a general Relation of greater and less, without any precise Difference or Proportion. But when we see the universal exact Agreement of all possible Sizes of such Systems of Solids, that they preserve to each other the constant <em>Ratio</em> of 3, 2, 1; how beautiful is the <em>Theorem</em>, and how are we ravish'd with its first Discovery!","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Easy Theorems.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">We</span> may likewise observe, that <em>easy</em> or <em>obvious</em> Propositions, even where the <em>Unity</em> is sufficiently distinct, and determinate, do not please us so much as those, which being less <em>obvious</em>, give us some <em>Surprize</em> in the Discovery: Thus we find little Pleasure in discovering that <em>a Line bisecting the vertical Angle of an Isosceles Triangle, bisects the Base</em>, or the <em>Reverse</em>; or, that <em>Equilateral Triangles are Equiangular</em>. These Truths we almost know <em>Intuitively</em>, without Demonstration: They are like common <em>Goods</em>, or those which Men have long possessed, which do not give such sensible Joys as much smaller new <em>Additions</em> may give us. But let none hence imagine, that the sole Pleasure of Theorems is from <em>Surprize</em>; for the same <em>Novelty</em> of a single Experiment does not please us much: nor ought we to conclude from the greater Pleasure accompanying a <em>new</em>, or <em>unexpected</em> Advantage, that <em>Surprize</em>, or <em>Novelty</em> is the only Pleasure of Life, or the only ground of Delight in <em>Truth</em>. Another kind of Surpirze in certain Theorems increases our Pleasure above what we have in Theorems of greater Extent; when we discover a <em>general Truth</em>, which upon some confused Notion we had reputed false: as that <em>Assymptotes always approaching should never meet the Curve</em>. This is like the Joy of unexpected Advantage where we dreaded Evil.

And this Pleasure we enjoy even when we have no Prospect of obtaining any other <em>Advantage</em> from such Manner of Deduction, than the immediate Pleasure of contemplating the <em>Beauty</em>: nor could Love of <em>Fame</em> excite us to such regular Methods of Deduction, were we not conscious that Mankind are pleas'd with them immediately, by this <em>internal Sense</em> of their <em>Beauty</em>.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Fantastick Beauty.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">It</span> is no less easy to see into what absurd Attempts Men have been led by this Sense of <em>Beauty</em>, and a silly Affectation of obtaining it in the other Sciences as well as the <em>Mathematicks</em>.

All which can thence be infer'd is only this, that as in our external Senses, so in our <em>internal</em> ones, the pleasant Sensations generally arise from those Objects which calm Reason would have recommended, had we understood their Use, and which might have engag'd our pursuits from <em>Self-Interest</em>.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Works of Art.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">As</span> to the Works of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Art</span>, were we to run thro' the various artificial Contrivances or Structures, we should constantly find the Foundation of the <em>Beauty</em> which appears in them, to be some kind of <em>Uniformity</em>, or <em>Unity</em> of Proportion among the Parts, and of each Part to the Whole. As there is a great Diversity of Proportions possible, and different Kinds of <em>Uniformity</em>, so there is room enough for that Diversity of Fancys observable in <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Gardening</em>, and such like Arts in different <em>Nations</em>; they all may have <em>Uniformity</em>, tho' the Parts in one may differ from those in another. The <em>Chinese</em> or <em>Persian</em> Buildings are not like the <em>Grecian</em> and <em>Roman</em>, and yet the former has its <em>Uniformity</em> of the various Parts to each other, and to the Whole, as well as the latter. In that kind of Architecture which the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europeans</span> call <em>Regular</em>, the <em>Uniformity</em> of Parts is very obvious, the several Parts are <em>regular Figures</em>, and either <em>equal</em> or <em>similar</em> at least in the same Range; the Pedestals are <em>Parallelopipedons</em> or square <em>Prisms</em>; the Pillars, <em>Cylinders</em> nearly; the Arches <em>circular</em>, and all those in the same Row <em>equal</em>; there is the same Proportion every-where observ'd in the same Range between the <em>Diameters</em> of Pillars and their <em>Heights</em>, their <em>Capitals</em>, the <em>Diameters</em> of <em>Arches</em>, the <em>Heights</em> of the <em>Pedestals</em>, the <em>Projections</em> of the <em>Cornice</em>, and all the Ornaments in each of our <em>five Orders</em>.
