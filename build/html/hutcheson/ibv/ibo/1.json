Thus <em>Seeing</em> and <em>Hearing</em> denote the different Powers of receiving the Ideas of Colours and Sounds. And altho' Colours have great Differences among themselves, as also have Sounds; yet there is a greater Agreement among the most opposite Colours, than between any Colour and a Sound: Hence we call all Colours Perceptions of the same Sense.

We define Substances only by enumerating these sensible Ideas: And such Definitions may raise a clear enough Idea of the Substance in the Mind of one who never immediately perceiv'd the Substance; provided he has separately receiv'd by his Senses all the simple Ideas which are in the Composition of the complex one of the Substance defin'd: But if there be any simple Ideas which he has not receiv'd, or if he wants any of the Senses necessary for the Perception of them, no Definition can raise any simple Idea which has not been before perceived by the <em>Senses</em>.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Education.

This will appear from reflecting on those Objects, to which we have now an Aversion, tho' they were formerly agreeable: And we shall generally find that there is some accidental <em>Conjunction</em> of a disagreeable Idea, which always recurs with the Object; as in those Wines to which Men acquire an Aversion, after they have taken them in an Emetick Preparation: In this case we are conscious that the <em>Idea</em> is alter'd from what it was when that Wine was agreeable, by the Conjunction of the Ideas of Loathing and Sickness of Stomach. The like Change of <em>Idea</em> may be insensibly made by the Change of our Bodys as we advance in Years, or when we are accustomed to any Object, which may occasion an Indifference toward Meats we were fond of in our Childhood; and may make some Objects cease to raise the disagreeable Ideas, which they excited upon our first use of them. Many of our simple Perceptions are disagreeable only thro' the too great <em>Intenseness</em> of the Quality: thus moderate Light is agreeable, very strong Light may be painful; moderate Bitter may be pleasant, a higher Degree may be offensive. A Change in our Organs will necessarily occasion a Change in the Intenseness of the Perception at least; nay sometimes will occasion a quite contrary Perception: Thus a warm Hand shall feel that Water cold, which a cold hand shall feel warm.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">We</span> shall not find it perhaps so easy to account for the Diversity of Fancy about more <em>complex Ideas</em> of Objects, including many Ideas of different Senses at once; as in some Perceptions of those call'd <em>primary Qualitys</em>, and some <em>secondary</em>, as explain'd by <span class=\"name\">Mr. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Locke</span></span>: for instance, in the different Fancys about <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Gardening</em>, <em>Dress</em>. Of the two former we shall offer something in <cite>Sect. VI.</cite> As to <em>Dress</em>, we may generally account for the Diversity of Fancys from a like Conjunction of Ideas: Thus, if either from any thing in Nature, or from the Opinion of our Country or Acquaintance, the fancying of <em>glaring Colours</em> be look'd upon as an evidence of Levity, or of any other evil Quality of Mind; or if any <em>Colour or Fashion</em> be commonly us'd by Rusticks, or by Men of any disagreeable Profession, Employment, or Temper; these additional Ideas may recur constantly with that of the <em>Colour</em> or <em>Fashion</em>, and cause a constant Dislike to them in those who join the additional Ideas, altho' the Colour or Form be no way disagreeable of themselves, and actually do please others who join no such Ideas to them. But there appears no Ground to believe such a Diversity in human Minds, as that the same simple Idea or Perception should give pleasure to one and pain to another, or to the same Person at different times; not to say that it seems a Contradiction, that the same simple Idea should do so.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Complex Ideas.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">The</span> only Pleasure of Sense, which many Philosophers seem to consider, is that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation: But there are far greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of Objects, which obtain the Names of <em>Beautiful</em>, <em>Regular</em>, <em>Harmonious</em>. Thus every one acknowledges he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture, than with the View of any one Colour, were it as strong and lively as possible; and more pleas'd with a Prospect of the Sun arising among settled Clouds, and colouring their Edges, with a starry Hemisphere, a fine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear blue Sky, a smooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify'd by Woods, Hills, Waters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are not quite <em>simple</em>.

I should rather chuse to call our Power of perceiving these Ideas, an <span class=\"small-capitals\">Internal Sense</span>, were it only for the Convenience of distinguishing them from other Sensations of Seeing and Hearing, which men may have without Perception of <em>Beauty</em> and <em>Harmony</em>. It is plain from Experience, that many Men have, in the common meaning, the Senses of Seeing and Hearing perfect enough; they perceive all the <em>simple Ideas</em> separately, and have their Pleasures; they distinguish them from each other, such as one Colour from another, either quite different, or the stronger or fainter of the same Colour, when they are plac'd beside each other, altho' they may often confound their <em>Names</em>, when they occur apart from each other; as some do the Names of <em>Green</em> and <em>Blue</em>: they can tell in separate Notes the <em>higher</em>, <em>lower</em>, <em>sharper or flatter</em>, when separately sounded; in Figures they discern the <em>Length</em>, <em>Breadth</em>, <em>Wideness</em> of each Line, Surface, Angle; and may be as capable of hearing and seeing at great Distances as any Men whatsoever: And yet perhaps they shall find no Pleasure in Musical Compositions, in Painting, Architecture, natural Landskip; or but a very weak one in comparison of what others enjoy from the same Objects. This greater Capacity of receiving such pleasant Ideas we commonly call a <em>fine Genius</em> or <em>Taste</em>: In Musick we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct Sense from the External one of Hearing, and call it a <em>good Ear</em>; and the like Distinction we should probably acknowledge in other Objects, had we also got distinct Names to denote these <em>Powers</em> of Perception by.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Different from External.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">We</span> generally imagine the brute Animals endowed with the same sort of Powers of Perception as our <em>External Senses</em>, and having sometimes greater Acuteness in them: but we conceive few or none of them with any of these sublimer Powers of Perception here call'd <em>Internal Senses</em>; or at least if some of them have them, it is in a Degree much inferior to ours.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">There</span> will appear another Reason perhaps afterwards, for calling this Power of perceiving the Ideas of <em>Beauty</em>, an <em>Internal Sense</em>, from this, that in some other Affairs, where our <em>External Senses</em> are not much concern'd, we discern a sort of Beauty, very like, in many respects, to that observ'd in sensible Objects, and accompany'd with like Pleasure: Such is that <em>Beauty</em> perceiv'd in <em>Theorems</em>, or universal Truths, in <em>general Causes</em>, and in some <em>extensive Principles</em> of Action.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Let</span> one consider, first, That 'tis probably a Being may have the full Power of External Sensation, which we enjoy, so as to perceive each Colour, Line, Surface, as we do; yet, without the Power of <em>comparing</em>, or of discerning the <em>Similitudes</em> or Proportions: Again, It might discern these also, and yet have no <em>Pleasure</em> or Delight accompanying these Perceptions. The bare Idea of the Form is something separable from Pleasure, as may appear from the different <em>Tastes</em> of Men about the Beauty of Forms, where we don't imagine that they differ in any Ideas, either of the Primary or Secondary Qualities. <em>Similitude</em>, <em>Proportion</em>, <em>Analogy</em>, or <em>Equality</em> of Proportion, are Objects of the Understanding, and must be actually known before we know the natural Causes of our Pleasure. But <em>Pleasure</em> perhaps is not necessarily connected with the Perception of them: and may be felt where the Proportion is not known or attended to: and may not be felt where the Proportion is observed. Since then there are such different Powers of Perception, where what are commonly called the <em>External Senses</em> are the same; since the most accurate Knowledge of what the External Senses discover, may often not give the Pleasure of Beauty or Harmony, which yet one of a <em>good Taste</em> will enjoy at once without much <em>Knowledge</em>; we may justly use another Name for these higher and more delightful Perceptions of Beauty and Harmony, and call the <em>Power</em> of receiving such Impressions, and <em>Internal Sense</em>: The Difference of the Perceptions seems sufficient to vindicate the Use of a different Name, especially when we are told in what Meaning the Word is applied.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Its Pleasures necessary and immediate.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">This</span> superior Power of Perception is justly called a <em>Sense</em>, because of its Affinity to the other Senses in this, that the Pleasure does not arise from any <em>Knowledge</em> of Principles, Proportions, Causes, or of the Usefulness of the Object; we are struck at the first with the Beauty: nor does the most accurate <em>Knowledge</em> increase this Pleasure of Beauty, however it may superadd a distinct rational Pleasure from prospects of <em>Advantage</em>, or may bring along that peculiar kind of Pleasure, which attends the Increase of Knowledge<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.","subId":"16","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">And</span> further, the Ideas of Beauty and Harmony, like other sensible Ideas, are <em>necessarily</em> pleasant to us, as well as immediately so; neither can any Resolution of our own, nor any <em>Prospect</em> of Advantage or Disadvantage, vary the Beauty or Deformity of an Object: For as in the external Sensations, no View of <em>Interest</em> will make an Object grateful, nor View of <em>Detriment</em>, distinct from immediate <em>Pain</em> in the Perception, make it disagreeable to the Sense; so propose the whole World as a <em>Reward</em>, or <em>threaten</em> the greatest Evil, to make us approve a deform'd Object, or disapprove a beautiful one; Dissimulation may be procur'd by Rewards or Threatnings, or we may in external Conduct abstain from any <em>Pursuit</em> of the Beautiful, and pursue the Deform'd; but our <em>Sentiments</em> of the Forms, and our <em>Perceptions</em>, would continue invariably the same.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">This Sense antecedent to and distinct from prospects of interest.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hence</span> it plainly appears, <q>that some Objects are <em>immediately</em> the Occasions of this Pleasure of Beauty, and that we have Senses fitted for perceiving it; and that it is distinct from that <em>Joy</em> which arises upon Prospect of Advantage.</q> Nay, do not we often see Convenience and Use neglected to obtain Beauty, without any other prospect of <em>Advantage</em> in the Beautiful Form, than the suggesting the pleasant Ideas of Beauty? Now this shews us, that however we may <em>pursue</em> beautiful Objects from Self-love, with a view to obtain the Pleasures of Beauty, as in Architecture, Gardening, and many other Affairs; yet there must be a <em>Sense</em> of Beauty, antecedent to Prospects even of this Advantage, without which Sense these Objects would not be thus <em>advantageous</em>, nor excite in us this Pleasure which constitutes them advantageous. Our <em>Sense</em> of Beauty from Objects, by which they are constituted good to us, is very distinct from our <em>Desire</em> of them when they are thus constituted: Our <em>Desire</em> of Beauty may be counter-balanc'd by Rewards or Threatnings, but never our <em>Sense</em> of it; even as Fear of Death may make us desire a bitter Potion, or neglect those Meats which the Sense of Taste would recommend as pleasant; but cannot make that Potion agreeable to the <em>Sense</em>, or Meat disagreeable to it, which was not so antecedently to this Prospect. The same holds true of the Sense of Beauty and Harmony; that the <em>Pursuit</em> of such Objects is frequently neglected, from Prospects of Advantage, Aversion to Labour, or any other Motive of Interest, does not prove that we have no <em>Sense</em> of Beauty, but only that our Desire of it may be counter-balanc'd by a stronger Desire.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Had</span> we no such <em>Sense</em> of Beauty and Harmony; Houses, Gardens, Dress, Equipage, might have been recommended to us as convenient, fruitful, warm, easy; but never as <em>beautiful</em>: And yet nothing is more certain, than that all these Objects are recommended under quite different <em>Views</em> on many Occasions: 'Tis true, what chiefly pleases in the Countenance, are the Indications of <em>Moral Dispositions</em>; and yet were we by the longest Acquaintance fully convinc'd of the best Moral Dispositions in any Person, with that Countenance we now think deform'd, this would never hinder our immediate Dislike of the Form, or our liking other Forms more: And Custom, Education, or Example, could never give us <em>Perceptions</em> distinct from those of the Senses which we had the Use of before, or recommend Objects under another <em>Conception</em> than grateful to<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> them.
