All <em>Beauty</em> is relative to the Sense of some Mind perceiving it; but what we call <em>relative</em> is that which is apprehended in any <em>Object</em>, commonly consider'd as an <em>Imitation</em> of some Original: And this <em>Beauty</em> is founded on a <em>Conformity</em>, or a kind of <em>Unity</em> between the Original and the Copy. The Original may be either some Object in <em>Nature</em>, or some <em>establish'd Idea</em>; for if there be any known <em>Idea</em> as a Standard, and Rules to fix this Image or <em>Idea</em> by, we may make a <em>beautiful Imitation</em>. Thus a <em>Statuary</em>, <em>Painter</em>, or <em>Poet</em>, may please us with an <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Hercules</span></span>, if his Piece retains that <em>Grandeur</em>, and those marks of <em>Strength</em> and <em>Courage</em>, which we imagine in that Hero.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">And</span> farther, to obtain <em>comparative Beauty</em> alone, it is not necessary that there be any Beauty in the Original; the Imitation of <em>absolute Beauty</em> may indeed in the whole make a more lovely Piece, and yet an exact Imitation shall still be <em>beautiful</em>, though the Original were intirely void of it: Thus the <em>Deformitys</em> of old Age in a Picture, the <em>rudest Rocks</em> or <em>Mountains</em> in a <em>Landskip</em>, if well represented, shall have abundant <em>Beauty</em>, tho' perhaps not so great as if the Original were <em>absolutely beautiful</em>, and as well represented: Nay, perhaps the <em>Novelty</em> may make us prefer the Representation of Irregularity.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Description in Poetry.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">The</span> same Observation holds true in the Descriptions of the Poets either of <em>natural</em> Objects or Persons; and this <em>relative Beauty</em> is what they should principally endeavour to obtain, as the peculiar <em>Beauty</em> of their Works. By the <span class=\"foreign\">Moratae Fabulae</span>, or the <span class=\"foreign\">ἢθη</span> of <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Aristotle</span></span>, we are not to understand <em>virtuous Manners</em>, but a <em>just Representation</em> of Manners or Characters as they are in <em>Nature</em>; and that the <em>Actions</em> and <em>Sentiments</em> be suited to the Characters of the <em>Persons</em> to whom they are ascrib'd in <em>Epick</em> and <em>Dramatick</em> Poetry. Perhaps very good Reasons may be suggested from the Nature of our <em>Passions</em>, to prove that a Poet should not draw his <em>Characters</em> perfectly <em>Virtuous</em>; these Characters indeed, abstractly consider'd, might give more Pleasure, and have more <em>Beauty</em> than the <em>imperfect</em> ones which occur in Life with a mixture of Good and Evil: But it may suffice at present to suggest against this Choice, that we have more lively Ideas of <em>imperfect Men</em> with all their Passions, than of <em>morally perfect Heroes</em>, such as really never occur to our Observation; and of which consequently we cannot judge exactly as to their Agreement with the Copy. And further, thro' Consciousness of our own State, we are more nearly touch'd and affected by the <em>imperfect Characters</em>; since in them we see represented, in the Persons of others, the Contrasts of Inclinations, and the <em>Struggles</em> between the Passions of <em>Self-Love</em> and those of <em>Honour</em> and <em>Virtue</em>, which we often feel in our own Breasts. This is the Perfection of <em>Beauty</em> for which <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Homer</span></span> is justly admir'd, as well as for the <em>Variety</em> of his <em>Characters</em>.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Probability, Simile, Metaphor.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Many</span> other Beautys of Poetry may be reduc'd under this Class of <em>relative Beauty</em>: The <em>Probability</em> is absolutely necessary to make us imagine <em>Resemblance</em>; it is by Resemblance that the <em>Similitudes</em>, <em>Metaphors</em> and <em>Allegorys</em> are made <em>beautiful</em>, whether either the Subject or the Thing compar'd to it have <em>Beauty</em> or not; the <em>Beauty</em> indeed is greater, when both have some <em>original Beauty</em> or Dignity as well as <em>Resemblance</em>: and this is the foundation of the Rule of studying <em>Decency</em> in <em>Metaphors</em> and <em>Similes</em> as well as <em>Likeness</em>. The <em>Measures</em> and <em>Cadence</em> are instances of <em>Harmony</em>, and come under the head of <em>absolute Beauty</em>.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Proneness to compare.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">We</span> may here observe a strange Proneness in our Minds to make <em>perpetual Comparisons</em> of all things which occur to our Observation, even of those which are very different from each other. There are certain <em>Resemblances</em> in the Motions of all Animals upon like Passions, which easily found a <em>Comparison</em>; but this does not serve to entertain our Fancy: <em>Inanimate Objects</em> have often such Positions as resemble those of the <em>human Body</em> in various Circumstances; these Airs or Gestures of the <em>Body</em> are Indications of certain Dispositions in the <em>Mind</em>, so that our very <em>Passions</em> and <em>Affections</em>, as well as other Circumstances, obtain a Resemblance to <em>natural inanimate Objects</em>. Thus a <em>Tempest</em> at Sea is often an Emblem of <em>Wrath</em>; a <em>Plant</em> or <em>Tree</em> drooping under the Rain, of a Person in <em>Sorrow</em>; a <em>Poppy</em> bending its Stalk, or a <em>Flower</em> withering when cut by the Plow, resembles the Death of a <em>blooming Hero</em>; an <em>aged Oak</em> in the Mountains shall represent an <em>old Empire</em>, a <em>Flame</em> seizing a Wood shall represent a <em>War</em>. In short, every thing in <em>Nature</em>, by our strange inclination to <em>Resemblance</em>, shall be brought to represent other things, even the most remote, especially the Passions and Circumstances of human Nature in which we are more nearly concern'd; and to confirm this, and furnish Instances of it, one need only look into <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Homer</span></span> or <span class=\"name\"><span class=\"small-capitals\">Virgil</span></span>. A fruitful Fancy would find in a <em>Grove</em>, or a <em>Wood</em>, an Emblem for every <em>Character in a Commonwealth</em>, and every turn of <em>Temper</em>, or <em>Station in Life</em>.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Intention.</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Concerning</span> that kind of <em>comparative Beauty</em> which has a necessary relation to some establish'd Idea, we may observe, that some Works of <em>Art</em> acquire a <em>distinct Beauty</em> by their Correspondence to some universally suppos'd <em>Intention</em> in the Artificer, or the Persons who employ'd him: And to obtain this <em>Beauty</em>, sometimes they do not form their Works so as to attain the highest Perfection of <em>original Beauty</em> separately consider'd; because a Composition of this <em>relative Beauty</em>, along with some degree of the <em>original</em> Kind, may give more Pleasure, than a more <em>perfect original Beauty</em> separately. Thus we see, that strict <em>Regularity</em> in laying out of Gardens in <em>Parterres</em>, <em>Vistas</em>, <em>parallel Walks</em>, is often neglected, to obtain an Imitation of <em>Nature</em> even in some of its <em>Wildnesses</em>. And we are more pleas'd with this <em>Imitation</em>, especially when the Scene is large and spacious, than with the more confin'd Exactness of <em>regular Works</em>. So likewise in the <em>Monuments</em> erected in honour of deceased <em>Heroes</em>, altho' a <em>Cylinder</em>, or <em>Prism</em>, or <em>regular Solid</em>, may have more <em>original Beauty</em> than a very acute <em>Pyramid</em> or <em>Obelisk</em>, yet the latter pleases more, by answering better the suppos'd Intentions of <em>Stability</em>, and being <em>conspicuous</em>. For the same reason <em>Cubes</em>, or square <em>Prisms</em>, are generally chosen for the <em>Pedestals</em> of <em>Statues</em>, and not any of the more <em>beautiful Solids</em>, which do not seem so secure from rolling. This may be the reason too, why <em>Columns</em> or <em>Pillars</em> look best when made a little taper from the middle or a third from the bottom, that they may not seem top-heavy, and in danger of falling.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.4.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">The</span> like Reason may influence Artists, in many other Instances, to depart from the Rules of <em>original Beauty</em>, as above laid down.

The Observations already made on this Subject are in every one's Hand, in the Treatises of our late Improvers of <em>mechanical Philosophy</em>.

Whereas we see, that in these very Things <em>Similitude</em> of parts is regarded, where unlike Parts would be equally useful: thus the Feet of a Chair would be of the same Use, tho' unlike, were they equally long; tho' one were strait, and the other bended; or one bending outwards, and the other inwards: A Coffin-shape for a Door would bear a more manifest Aptitude to the human Shape, than that which Artists require. And then what is the <em>Use</em> of these <em>Imitations of Nature</em>, or of its Works, in <em>Architecture</em>? Why should a Pillar please which has some of the Human Proportions? Is the <em>End</em> or <em>Use</em> of a Pillar the same as of a Man? Why the Imitation of other natural or well-proportioned Things in the Entablature? Is there then a <em>Sense of Imitation</em>, relishing it where there is no other Use than this, that it naturally pleases? Again; Is no Man pleased with the Shapes of any Animals, but those which he expects Use from? The Shapes of the Horse or the Ox may promise Use to the Owner; but is he the only Person who relishes the Beauty? And is there no Beauty discerned in Plants, in Flowers, in Animals, whose Use is to us unknown?
