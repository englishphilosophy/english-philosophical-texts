Our copytext is the fourth edition of 1738, likewise “Corrected”, which contains Hutcheson's final modifications and additions. The text was derived from Wolfgang Leidhold's edition (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004), which follows the second 1726 edition (noting significant variants from other editions), and removes most of the original italics and small capitals.

All Men who speak of <em>moral Good</em>, acknowledge that it procures <em>Approbation</em> and <em>Good-will</em> toward those we apprehend possess'd of it; whereas <em>natural Good</em> does not. In this matter Men must consult their own Breasts. How differently are they affected toward those they suppose possess'd of <em>Honesty</em>, <em>Faith</em>, <em>Generosity</em>, <em>Kindness</em>; and those who are possess'd of the <em>natural Goods</em>, such as <em>Houses</em>, <em>Lands</em>, <em>Gardens</em>, <em>Vineyards</em>, <em>Health</em>, <em>Strength</em>, <em>Sagacity</em>? We shall find that we necessarily love and approve the Possessors of the former; but the Possession of the latter procures no <em>Approbation</em> or <em>Good-will</em> at all toward the Possessor, but often contrary Affections of <em>Envy</em> and <em>Hatred</em>. In the same manner, whatever Quality we apprehend to be <em>morally Evil</em>, raises our Dislike toward the Person in whom we observe it, such as <em>Treachery</em>, <em>Cruelty</em>, <em>Ingratitude</em>; whereas we heartily love, esteem, and pity many who are expos'd to <em>natural Evils</em>, such as <em>Pain</em>, <em>Poverty</em>, <em>Hunger</em>, <em>Sickness</em>, <em>Death</em>.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.Intro.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Now</span> the first Question on this Subject is, <q>Whence arise these different Ideas of Actions?</q>","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.Intro.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\">Interest.

Our Perception of Pleasure is necessary, and nothing is <em>advantageous</em> or <em>naturally Good</em> to us, but what is apt to raise Pleasure <em>mediately</em>, or <em>immediately</em>.
