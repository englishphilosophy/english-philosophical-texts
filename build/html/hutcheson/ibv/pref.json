Our late Inquirys have been very much employ'd about our </em>Understanding<em>, and the several Methods of obtaining </em>Truth<em>. We generally acknowledge, that the Importance of any Truth is nothing else than its Moment, or Efficacy to make Men happy, or to give them the greatest and most lasting Pleasure; and </em>Wisdom<em> denotes only a Capacity of pursuing this End by the best Means. It must surely then be of the greatest importance, to have distinct Conceptions of this End itself, as well as of the Means necessary to obtain it; that we may find out which are the greatest and most lasting Pleasures, and not employ our Reason, after all our laborious Improvements of it, in trifling Pursuits. It is to be fear'd indeed, that most of our Studys, without this Inquiry, will be of very little use to us; for they seem to have scarce any other tendency than to lead us into </em>speculative Knowledge<em> itself. Nor are we distinctly told how it is that </em>Knowledge<em> or </em>Truth<em> is pleasant to us.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Pref.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>THIS Consideration put the </em>Author<em> of the following Papers upon inquiring into the various Pleasures which </em>Human Nature<em> is capable of receiving. We shall generally find in our modern philosophick Writings, nothing further on this Head, than some bare Division of them into </em>Sensible<em>, and </em>Rational<em>, and some trite Common-place Arguments to prove the </em>latter<em> more valuable than the </em>former<em>. Our </em>sensible Pleasures<em> are slightly pass'd over, and explain'd only by some Instances in </em>Tastes<em>, </em>Smells<em>, </em>Sounds<em>, or such-like, which Men of any tolerable Reflection generally look upon as very trifling Satisfactions. Our </em>rational Pleasures<em> have had much the same kind of Treatment. We are seldom taught any other Notion of rational Pleasure than that which we have upon reflecting on our Possession, or Claim to those Objects, which may be Occasions of Pleasure. Such Objects we call </em>advantageous<em>; but </em>Advantage<em>, or </em>Interest<em>, cannot be distinctly conceiv'd, till we know what those Pleasures are which advantageous Objects are apt to excite; and what Senses or Powers of Perception we have with respect to such Objects. We may perhaps find such an Inquiry of more importance in Morals, to prove what we call the </em>Reality of Virtue<em>, or that it is the </em>surest Happiness<em> of the </em>Agent<em>, than one would at first imagine.</em>","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Pref.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>IN reflecting upon our </em>external Senses<em>, we plainly see, that our Perceptions of Pleasure, or Pain, do not depend directly on our </em>Will<em>. Objects do not please us, according as we incline they should. The presence of some Objects necessarily pleases us, and the presence of others as necessarily displeases us. Nor can we, by our </em>Will<em>, any otherwise procure Pleasure, or avoid Pain, than by procuring the former kind of Objects, and avoiding the latter. By the very </em>Frame<em> of our </em>Nature<em> the one is made the occasion of Delight, and the other of Dissatisfaction.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Pref.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>THE same Observation will hold in all our other Pleasures and Pains. For there are many other sorts of Objects, which please, or displease us as necessarily, as material Objects do when they operate upon our Organs of Sense. There are few Objects which are not thus constituted the necessary occasion of some Pleasure or Pain. Thus we find our selves pleas'd with a </em>regular Form<em>, a piece of </em>Architecture<em> or </em>Painting<em>, a Composition of </em>Notes<em>, a </em>Theorem<em>, an </em>Action<em>, an </em>Affection<em>, a </em>Character<em>. And we are conscious that this Pleasure necessarily arises from the Contemplation of the Idea, which is then present to our Minds, with all its Circumstances, although some of these Ideas have nothing of what we call sensible Perception in them; and in those which have, the Pleasure arises from some </em>Uniformity<em>, </em>Order<em>, </em>Arrangement<em>, </em>Imitation<em>; and not from the simple Ideas of </em>Colour<em>, or </em>Sound<em>, or mode of </em>Extension<em> separately consider'd.</em>","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Pref.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>THESE </em>Determinations<em> to be pleas'd with certain complex Forms, the Author chuses to call <span class=\"small-capitals\">Senses</span>; distinguishing them from the Powers which commonly go by that Name, by calling our Power of perceiving the </em>Beauty<em> of </em>Regularity<em>, </em>Order<em>, </em>Harmony<em>, an <span class=\"small-capitals\">Internal Sense</span>; and </em>that Determination<em> to approve </em>Affections<em>, </em>Actions<em>, or </em>Characters<em> of </em>rational Agents<em>, which we call </em>virtuous<em>, he marks by the name of a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Moral Sense</span>.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Pref.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>HIS principal Design is to shew, <q>That </em>Human Nature<em> was not left quite indifferent in the affair of </em>Virtue<em>, to form to itself Observations concerning the </em>Advantage<em>, or </em>Disadvantage<em> of Actions, and accordingly to regulate its Conduct.</q> The weakness of our Reason, and the avocations arising from the Infirmity and Necessitys of our Nature, are so great, that very few Men could ever have form'd those long Deductions of Reason, which shew some Actions to be in the whole </em>advantageous<em> to the </em>Agent<em>, and their Contrarys </em>pernicious<em>.
