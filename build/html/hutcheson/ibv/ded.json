Our copytext is the fourth edition of 1738, likewise “Corrected”, which contains Hutcheson's final modifications and additions. The text was derived from Wolfgang Leidhold's edition (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004), which follows the second 1726 edition (noting significant variants from other editions), and removes most of the original italics and small capitals. This source text has been substantially altered, reinstating the original formatting and bringing the text in line with the 1738 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hutcheson-an-inquiry-into-the-original-of-our-ideas-of-beauty-and-virtue-1726-2004/simple#lf1458_div_022","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"TO His <span class=\"small-capitals\">Excellency</span> JOHN, Lord <em><span class=\"name\">CARTERET</span></em>, Lord Lieutenant of <em>IRELAND</em>.","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Ded"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>May it please your Excellency,</em> <br> WHEN I publish'd these Papers, I had so little Confidence of their Success, that I was unwilling to own them; and what I was unwilling myself to own, I durst not presume to inscribe to any great Name.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Ded.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Your</span> Excellency's favourable Reception of them, soon put me out of all Fears about their Success with the wiser and better Part of the World; and since this has given me Assurance to own them, I humbly presume to inscribe them in this second Edition to your Excellency, that I may have at once an Opportunity of expressing the sincerest Gratitude for the Notice you were pleas'd to take of me, and have the Pleasure also of letting the World know, that this small Work has your Excellency's Approbation.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.Ded.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">The</span> Praise bestow'd by Persons of real Merit and Discernment, is allow'd by all to give a noble and rational Pleasure.

In the Conversation, with which your Excellency has been pleas'd to honour me, I could not, I own, without the utmost Surprize, observe so intimate an Acquaintance with the most valuable Writings of contemplative Men, Antient and Modern; so just a Taste of what is excellent in the ingenious Arts, in so young a Man, amidst the Hurry of an active Life.
