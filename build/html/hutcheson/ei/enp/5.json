Some pursue, or seem to pursue only the Pleasures of the <em>external Senses</em>, and all other Pursuits are made subservient to them: Others are chiefly set upon the Pleasures of <em>Imagination</em> or <em>internal Senses</em>; <em>social</em> and <em>kind Affections</em> employ another sort, who seem indifferent to all private Pleasure: This last Temper has generally joined with it an high <em>moral Sense</em>, and <em>Love of Honour</em>. We may sometimes find an high <em>Sense of Honour</em> and desire of <em>Applause</em>, where there is indeed a <em>moral Sense</em>, but a very weak one, very much perverted, so as to be influenced by <em>popular Opinion</em>, and made subservient to it: In this <em>Character</em> the Pleasures of the external Senses, or even of the Imagination, have little room, except so far as they may produce <em>Distinction</em>. Now upon comparing the several Pleasures, perhaps the Sentence of the <em>Luxurious</em> would be quite opposite to that of the <em>Virtuous</em>. The <em>Ambitious</em> would differ from both. Those who are devoted to the <em>internal Senses</em> or <em>Imagination</em>, would differ from all the three. The <em>Miser</em> would applaud himself in his Wealth above them all. Is there therefore no disputing about Tastes? Are all Persons alike happy, who obtain the several Enjoyments for which they have a Relish? If they are, the Dispute is at an end: A Fly or Maggot in its proper haunts, is as happy as a <em>Hero</em>, or <em>Patriot</em>, or <em>Friend</em>, who has newly delivered his <em>Country</em> or <em>Friend</em>, and is surrounded with their grateful <em>Praises</em>. The <em>Fly</em> or <em>Maggot</em> may think so of itself; but who will stand to its Judgment, when we are sure that it has experienced only one sort of Pleasure, and is a stranger to the others? May we not in like manner find some Reasons of <em>appealing</em> from the Judgment of certain Men?

The external Senses represent these Objects in the same manner, when they are conquered. None denies to the <em>Virtuous</em> their <em>Sense of Pain, Toil or Wounds</em>. They are allowed as lively a Sense as others, of all <em>external Pleasure</em> of every kind. The Expences of <em>Generosity</em>, <em>Humanity</em>, <em>Charity</em> and <em>Compassion</em>, are allowed, even when yielded to Virtue, to be known to the full. But the moral Sense, weak as it often is, does not yield even to known <em>external Pleasure</em>, <em>Ease</em> or <em>Advantage</em>: but, where there is a depraved <em>Taste</em>, and a weak <em>Understanding</em>, private Advantage, or the avoiding of some external Evil, may make Actions appear <em>innocent</em>, which are not; and then the moral Sense gives no Opposition. All the Conquest on such Occasions is only this, that private external <em>Advantage</em> surmounts our Aversion to <em>Dishonour</em>, by making us do Actions which <em>others</em> will censure, but we esteem <em>innocent</em>.
