The second (1730) was merely a reprint of the first, but the third (1742) contained some significant revisions. Consequently the third is our copytext. The text was derived from Aaron Garrett's edition (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2002), which follows the first edition (noting significant differences between this and third).
