And so of all living creatures, whilest they are imprisoned, or restrained, with walls, or chayns; and of the water whilest it is kept in by banks, or vessels, that otherwise would spread it selfe into a larger space, we use to say, they are not at Liberty, to move in such manner, as without those externall impediments they would. But when the impediment of motion, is in the constitution of the thing it selfe, we use not to say, it wants the Liberty; but the Power to move; as when a stone lyeth still, or a man is fastned to his bed by sicknesse.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the word, <em>A</em> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Free</span>-<span class=\"small-capitals\">Man</span>, <em>is he, that in those</em><span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>What it is to be Free.</em></span> <em>things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will to</em>. But when the words <em>Free</em>, and <em>Liberty</em>, are applyed to any thing but <em>Bodies</em>, they are abused; for that which is not subject to Motion, is not subject to Impediment: And therefore, when 'tis said (for example) The way is Free, no Liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk in it without stop. And when we say a Guift is Free, there is not meant any Liberty of the Guift, but of the Giver, that was not bound by any law, or Covenant to give it. So when we <em>speak Freely</em>, it is not the Liberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath obliged to speak otherwise then he did. Lastly, from the use of the word <em>Free-will</em>, no Liberty can be inferred of the will, desire, or inclination, but the Liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Feare and Liberty consistent.</em></span> Feare, and Liberty are consistent; as when a man throweth his goods into the Sea for <em>feare</em> the ship should sink, he doth it neverthelesse very willingly, and may refuse to doe it if he will: It is therefore the action, of one that was <em>free</em>: so a man sometimes pays his debt, only for <em>feare</em> of Imprisonment, which because no body hindred him from detaining, was the action of a man at <em>liberty</em>. And generally all actions which men doe in Common-wealths, for <em>feare</em> of the law, are actions, which the doers had <em>liberty</em> to omit.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Liberty and Necessity consistent.</em></span> <em>Liberty</em>, and <em>Necessity</em> are consistent: As in the water, that hath not only <em>liberty</em>, but a <em>necessity</em> of descending by the Channel; so likewise in the Actions which men voluntarily doe: which, because they proceed from their will, proceed from <em>liberty</em>; and yet, because every act of mans will, and every desire, and inclination proceedeth from some cause, and that from another cause, in a continuall chaine, (whose first link is in the hand of God the first of all causes,) they proceed from <em>necessity</em>. So that to him that could see the connexion of those causes, the <em>necessity</em> of all mens voluntary actions, would appeare manifest. And therefore God, that seeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the <em>liberty</em> of man in doing what he will, is accompanied with the <em>necessity</em> of doing that which God will, &amp; no more, nor lesse. For though men may do many things, which God does not command, nor is therefore Author of them; yet they can have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods will is not the cause. And did not his will assure the <em>necessity</em> of mans will, and consequently of all that on mans will dependeth, the <em>liberty</em> of men would be a contradiction, and impediment to the omnipotence and <em>liberty</em> of God. And this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of that naturall <em>liberty</em>, which only is properly called <em>liberty</em>.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Artificiall Bonds, or Covenants.</em></span> But as men, for the atteyning of peace, and conservation of themselves thereby, have made an Artificiall Man, which we call a Common-wealth; so also have they made Artificiall Chains, called <em>Civill Lawes</em>, which they themselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips of that Man, or Assembly, to whom they have given the Soveraigne Power; and at the other end to their own Ears. These Bonds in their own nature but weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not by the difficulty of breaking them.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In relation to these Bonds only it is, that I am<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Liberty of Subjects consisteth in Liberty from covenants.</em></span> to speak now, of the <em>Liberty</em> of <em>Subjects</em>. For seeing there is no Common-wealth in the world, wherein there be Rules enough set down, for the regulating of all the actions, and words of men, (as being a thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that in all kinds of actions, by the laws prætermitted, men have the Liberty, of doing what their own reasons shall suggest, for the most profitable to themselves. For if wee take Liberty in the proper sense, for corporall Liberty; that is to say, freedome from chains, and prison, it were very absurd for men to clamor as they doe, for the Liberty they so manifestly enjoy. Againe, if we take Liberty, for an exemption from Lawes, it is no lesse absurd, for men to demand as they doe, that Liberty, by which all other men may be masters of their lives. And yet as absurd as it is, this is it they demand; not knowing that the Lawes are of no power to protect them, without a Sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to be put in execution. The Liberty of a Subject, lyeth therefore only in those things, which in regulating their actions, the Soveraign hath prætermitted: such as is the Liberty to buy, and sell, and otherwise contract with one another; to choose their own aboad, their own diet, their own trade of life, and institute their children as they themselves think fit; &amp; the like.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Neverthelesse we are not to understand, that by such<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Liberty of the Subject consistent with the unlimited power of the Soveraign.</em></span> Liberty, the Soveraign Power of life, and death, is either abolished, or limited. For it has been already shewn, that nothing the Soveraign Representative can doe to a Subject, on what pretence soever, can properly be called Injustice, or Injury; because every Subject is Author of every act the Soveraign doth; so that he never wanteth Right to any thing, otherwise, than as he himself is the Subject of God, and bound thereby to observe the laws of Nature. And therefore it may, and doth often happen in Common-wealths, that a Subject may be put to death, by the command of the Soveraign Power; and yet neither doe the other wrong: As when <em>Jeptha</em> caused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like cases, he that so dieth, had Liberty to doe the action, for which he is neverthelesse, without Injury put to death. And the same holdeth also in a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an Innocent Subject. For though the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to Equitie, (as was the killing of <em>Uriah</em>, by <em>David</em>;) yet it was not an Injurie to <em>Uriah</em>; but to <em>God</em>. Not to <em>Uriah</em>, because the right to doe what he pleased, was given him by <em>Uriah</em> himself: And yet to <em>God</em>, because <em>David</em> was <em>Gods</em> Subject; and prohibited all Iniquitie by the law of Nature. Which distinction, <em>David</em> himself, when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, saying, <em>To thee only have I sinned</em>. In the same manner, the people of <em>Athens</em>, when they banished the most potent of their Common-wealth for ten years, thought they committed no Injustice; and yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he would doe: Nay they commanded the banishment of they knew not whom; and every Citizen bringing his Oystershell into the market place, written with the name of him he desired should be banished, without actuall accusing him, sometimes banished an <em>Aristides</em>, for his reputation of Justice; And sometimes a scurrilous Jester, as <em>Hyperbolus</em>, to make a Jest of it. And yet a man cannot say, the Soveraign People of <em>Athens</em> wanted right to banish them; or an <em>Athenian</em> the Libertie to Jest, or to be Just.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>The Liberty which writers praise, is the Liberty of Soveraigns; not of Private men.</em></span> The Libertie, whereof there is so frequent, and honourable mention, in the Histories, and Philosophy of the Antient Greeks, and Romans, and in the writings, and discourse of those that from them have received all their learning in the Politiques, is not the Libertie of Particular men; but the Libertie of the Common-wealth: which is the same with that, which every man then should have, if there were no Civil Laws, nor Common-wealth at all. And the effects of it also be the same. For as amongst masterlesse men, there is perpetuall war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the Son, nor to expect from the Father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a full and absolute Libertie in every Particular man: So in States, and Common-wealths not dependent on one another, every Common-wealth, (not every man) has an absolute Libertie, to doe what it shall judge (that is to say, what that Man, or Assemblie that representeth it, shall judge) most conducing to their benefit. But withall, they live in the condition of a perpetuall war, and upon the confines of battel, with their frontiers armed, and canons planted against their neighbours round about. The <em>Athenians</em>, and <em>Romanes</em> were free; that is, free Common-wealths: not that any particular men had the Libertie to resist their own Representative; but that their Representative had the Libertie to resist, or invade other people. There is written on the Turrets of the city of <em>Luca</em> in great characters at this day, the word <em>LIBERTAS</em>; yet no man can thence inferre, that a particular man has more Libertie, or Immunitie from the service of the Commonwealth there, than in <em>Constantinople</em>. Whether a Common-wealth be Monarchicall, or Popular, the Freedome is still the same.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But it is an easy thing, for men to be deceived, by the specious name of Libertie; and for want of Judgement to distinguish, mistake that for their Private Inheritance, and Birth right, which is the right of the Publique only. And when the same errour is confirmed by the authority of men in reputation for their writings in this subject, it is no wonder if it produce sedition, and change of Government. In these westerne parts of the world, we are made to receive our opinions concerning the Institution, and Rights of Common-wealths, from <em>Aristotle, Cicero</em>, and other men, Greeks and Romanes, that living under Popular States, derived those Rights, not from the Principles of Nature, but transcribed them into their books, out of the Practise of their own Common-wealths, which were Popular; as the Grammarians describe the Rules of Language, out of the Practise of the time; or the Rules of Poetry, out of the Poems of <em>Homer</em> and <em>Virgil</em>. And because the Athenians were taught, (to keep them from desire of changing their Government,) that they were Freemen, and all that lived under Monarchy were slaves; therefore <em>Aristotle</em> puts it down in his <em>Politiques</em>, (<em>lib</em>. 6. <em>cap</em>. 2.) <em>In democracy</em>, Liberty <em>is to be supposed: for 'tis commonly held, that no man is</em> Free <em>in any other Government</em>. And as <em>Aristotle</em>; so <em>Cicero</em>, and other Writers have grounded their Civill doctrine, on the opinions of the Romans, who were taught to hate Monarchy, at first, by them that having deposed their Soveraign, shared amongst them the Soveraignty of <em>Rome</em>; and afterwards by their Successors. And by reading of these Greek, and Latine Authors, men from their childhood have gotten a habit (under a false shew of Liberty,) of favouring tumults, and of licentious controlling the actions of their Soveraigns; and again of controlling those controllers, with the effusion of so much blood; as I think I may truly say, there was never any thing so deerly bought, as these Western parts have bought the learning of the Greek and Latine tongues.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.L.2.21.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Liberty of Subjects how to be measured.</em></span> To come now to the particulars of the true Liberty of a Subject; that is to say, what are the things, which though commanded by the Soveraign, he may neverthelesse, without Injustice, refuse to do; we are to consider, what Rights we passe away, when we make a Common-wealth; or (which is all one,) what Liberty we deny our selves, by owning all the Actions (without exception) of the Man, or Assembly we make our Soveraign.
