In both cases they do it for fear: which is to be noted by them, that hold all such Covenants, as proceed from fear of death, or violence, voyd: which if it were true, no man, in any kind of Common-wealth, could be obliged to Obedience. It is true, that in a Common-wealth once Instituted, or acquired, Promises proceeding from fear of death, or violence, are no Covenants, nor obliging, when the thing promised is contrary to the Lawes; But the reason is not, because it was made upon fear, but because he that promiseth, hath no right in the thing promised. Also, when he may lawfully performe, and doth not, it is not the Invalidity of the Covenant, that absolveth him, but the Sentence of the Soveraign.

The right of Dominion by Generation, is that, which the Parent hath over his Children; and is called <span class=\"small-capitals\">Paternall</span>. And is not so derived from the Generation, as if therefore the Parent had Dominion over his Child because he begat him; but from the Childs Consent, either expresse, or by other sufficient arguments declared. For as to the Generation, God hath ordained to man a helper; and there be alwayes two that are equally Parents: the Dominion therefore over the Child, should belong equally to both; and he be equally subject to both, which is impossible; for no man can obey two Masters. And whereas some have attributed the Dominion to the Man onely, as being of the more excellent Sex; they misreckon in it. For there is not alwayes that difference of strength, or prudence between the man and the woman, as that the right can be determined without War. In Common-wealths, this controversie is decided by the Civill Law: and for the most part, (but not alwayes) the sentence is in favour of the Father; because or the most part Common-wealths have been erected by the Fathers, not by the Mothers of families. But the question lyeth now in the state of meer Nature; where there are supposed no lawes of Matrimony; no lawes for the Education of Children; but the Law of Nature, and the naturall inclination of the Sexes, one to another, and to their children. In this condition of meer Nature, either the Parents between themselves dispose of the dominion over the Child by Contract; or do not dispose thereof at all. If they dispose thereof, the right passeth according to the Contract. We find in History that the <em>Amazons</em> Contracted with the Men of the neighbouring Countries, to whom they had recourse for issue, that the issue Male should be sent back, but the Female remain with themselves: so that the dominion of the Females was in the Mother.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.2.20.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Or Education;</em></span> If there be no Contract, the Dominion is in the Mother. For in the condition of meer Nature, where there are no Matrimoniall lawes, it cannot be known who is the Father, unlesse it be declared by the Mother: and therefore the right of Dominion over the Child dependeth on her will, and is consequently hers. Again, seeing the Infant is first in the power of the Mother, so as she may either nourish, or expose it; if she nourish it, it oweth its life to the Mother; and is therefore obliged to obey her, rather than any other; and by consequence the Dominion over it is hers. But if she expose it, and another find, and nourish it, the Dominion is in him that nourisheth it. For it ought to obey him by whom it is preserved; because preservation of life being the end, for which one man becomes subject to another, every man is supposed to promise obedience, to him, in whose power it is to save, or destroy him.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.2.20.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Or Precedent subjection of one of the Parents to the other.</em></span> If the Mother be the Fathers subject, the Child, is in the Fathers power: and if the Father be the Mothers subject, (as when a Soveraign Queen marrieth one of her subjects,) the Child is subject to the Mother; because the Father also is her subject.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.2.20.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If a man and a woman, Monarches of two severall Kingdomes, have a Child, and contract concerning who shall have the Dominion of him, the Right of the Dominion passeth by the Contract.

But yet a Family is not properly a Common-wealth; unlesse it be of that power by its own number, or by other opportunities, as not to be subdued without the hazard of war. For where a number of men are manifestly too weak to defend themselves united, every one may use his own reason in time of danger, to save his own life, either by flight, or by submission to the enemy, as hee shall think best; in the same manner as a very small company of souldiers, surprised by an army, may cast down their armes, and demand quarter, or run away, rather than be put to the sword. <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>The Rights of Monarchy from Scripture.</em></span> And thus much shall suffice; concerning what I find by speculation, and deduction, of Soveraign Rights, from the nature, need, and designes of men, in erecting of Common-wealths, and putting themselves under Monarchs, or Assemblies, entrusted with power enough for their protection.","subId":"15","id":"Hobbes.L.2.20.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let us now consider what the Scripture teacheth in the same point. To <em>Moses</em>, the children of <em>Israel</em> say thus. <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Exod</em>.20. 19.</span> <em>Speak thou to us, and we will heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye</em>. This is absolute obedience to Moses. Concerning the Right of Kings, God himself by the mouth of <em>Samuel</em>, saith, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>1 Sam</em>, 8. 11, 12, &amp;c.</span> <em>This shall be the Right of the King you will have to reigne over you. He shall take your sons, and set them to drive his Chariots, and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots; and gather in his harvest; and to make his engines of War, and Instruments of his chariots; and shall take your daughters to make perfumes, to be his Cookes, and Bakers. He shall take your fields, your vine-yards, and your olive yards, and give them to his servants. He shall take the tyth of your corne and wine, and give it to the men of his chamber, and to his other servants. He shall take your manservants, and your maid-servants, and the choice of your youth, and employ them in his businesse. He shall take the tyth of your flocks; and you shall be his servants. This is absolute power, and summed up in the last words, </em>you shall be his servants<em>.</em> Againe, when the people heard what power their King was to have, yet they consented thereto, and say thus, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Verse</em>. 19, &amp;c.</span> <em>We will be as all other nations, and our King shall judge our causes, and goe before us, to conduct our wars</em>. Here is confirmed the Right that Soveraigns have, both to the <em>Militia</em>, and to all <em>Judicature</em>; in which is conteined as absolute power, as one man can possibly transferre to another. Again, the prayer of King <em>Salomon</em> to God, was this. <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>1 Kings</em> 3. 9.</span> <em>Give to thy servant understanding, to judge thy people, and to discerne between Good and Evill</em>. It belongeth therefore to the overaigne to bee <em>Judge</em>, and to præscribe the Rules of <em>discerning Good</em> and <em>Evill</em>: which Rules are Lawes; <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>1 Sam</em>. 24. 9.</span> and therefore in him is the Legislative Power. <em>Saul</em> sought the life of <em>David</em>; yet when it was in his power to slay <em>Saul</em>, and his Servants would have done it, <em>David</em> forbad them, saying, <em>God forbid I should do such an act against my Lord, the anoynted of God</em>. For obedience of servants St. Paul saith, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Coll</em>. 3. 20.</span> <em>Servants obey your masters in All things</em>; and, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Verse</em> 22.</span> <em>Children obey your Parents in All things</em>. There is simple obedience in those that are subject to Paternall or Despoticall Dominion. Again, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Math</em>. 23. 2, 3.</span> <em>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chayre, and therefore All that they shall bid you observe, that observe and do</em>. There again is simple obedience. And St Paul, <em>Warn them that they subject themselves to Princes, and to those that are in Authority, &amp; obey them</em>. <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Tit</em>.3.2.</span> This obedience is also simple. Lastly, our Saviour himselfe acknowledges, that men ought to pay such taxes as are by Kings imposed, where he sayes, <em>Give to Cæsar that which is Cæsars</em>; and payed such taxes himselfe. And that the Kings word, is sufficient to take any thing from any Subject, when there is need; and that the King is Judge of that need: For he himselfe, as King of the Jewes, commanded his Disciples to take the Asse, and Asses Colt to carry him into <em>Jerusalem</em>, saying, <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Mat</em>. 21. 2, 3.</span> <em>Go into the Village over against you, and you shall find a shee Asse tyed, and her Colt with her, unty them, and bring them to me.

And though of so unlimited a Power, men may fancy many evill consequences, yet the consequences of the want of it, which is perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour, are much worse.
