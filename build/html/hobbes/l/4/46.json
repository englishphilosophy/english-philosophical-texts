The Explication (that is, the setling of the meaning) of which, and the like Terms, is commonly in the Schools called <em>Metaphysiques</em>; as being a part of the Philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title: but it is in another sense; for there it signifieth as much, as <em>Books written, or placed after his naturall Philosophy</em>: But the Schools take them for <em>Books of supernaturall Philosophy</em>: for the word <em>Metaphysiques</em> will bear both these senses.

Also I ask pardon of those that are not used to this kind of Discourse, for applying my selfe to those that are. The World, (I mean not the Earth onely, that denominates the Lovers of it <em>Worldly men</em>, but the <em>Universe</em>, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth, and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe, is Body; and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And because the Universe is All, that which is no part of it, is <em>Nothing</em>; and consequently <em>no where</em>. Nor does it follow from hence, that Spirits are <em>nothing</em>: for they have dimensions, and are therefore really <em>Bodies</em>; though that name in common Speech be given to such Bodies onely, as are visible, or palpable; that is, that have some degree of Opacity: But for Spirits, they call them Incorporeall; which is a name of more honour, and may therefore with more piety bee attributed to God himselfe; in whom wee consider not what Attribute expresseth best his Nature, which is Incomprehensible; but what best expresseth our desire to honour Him.","subId":"15","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To know now upon what grounds they say there be<em>Essences Abstract</em>, or <em>Substantiall Formes</em>, wee are to consider what those words do properly signifie.

Of which Words, some are the names of the Things conceived; as the names of all sorts of Bodies, that work upon the Senses, and leave an Impression in the Imaginations: Others are the names of the Imaginations themselves; that is to say, of those Ideas, or mentall Images we have of all things wee see, or remember: And others againe are names of Names; or of different sorts of Speech: As <em>Universall, Plurall, Singular</em>, are the names of Names; and <em>Definition, Affirmation, Negation, True, False, Syllogisme, Interrogation, Promise, Covenant</em>, are the names of certain Forms of Speech.

And as wee use the Verbe <em>Is</em>; so the Latines use their Verbe <em>Est</em>, and the Greeks their Εστι through all its Declinations. Whether all other Nations of the world have in their severall languages a word that answereth to it, or not, I cannot tell; but I am sure they have not need of it: For the placing of two names in order may serve to signifie their Consequence, if it were the custome, (for Custome is it, that give words their force,) as well as the words <em>Is</em>, or <em>Bee</em>, or <em>Are</em>, and the like.","subId":"16","id":"Hobbes.L.4.46.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And if it were so, that there were a Language without any Verb answerable to <em>Est</em>, or <em>Is</em>, or <em>Bee</em>; yet the men that used it would bee not a jot the lesse capable of Inferring, Concluding, and of all kind of Reasoning, than were the Greeks, and Latines.
