But who was the first that found the use of Letters, is not known. He that first brought them into <em>Greece</em>, men say was <em>Cadmus</em>, the sonne of <em>Agenor</em>, King of Phænicia. A profitable Invention for continuing the memory of time past, and the conjunction of mankind, dispersed into so many, and distant regions of the Earth; and with all difficult, as proceeding from a watchfull observation of the divers motions of the Tongue, Palat, Lips, and other organs of Speech; whereby to make as many differences of characters, to remember them. But the most noble and profitable invention of all other, was that of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Speech</span>, consisting of <em>Names</em> or <em>Appellations</em>, and their Connexion; whereby men register their Thoughts; recall them when they are past; and also declare them one to another for mutuall utility and conversation; without which, there had been amongst men, neither Common-wealth, nor Society, nor Contract, nor Peace, no more than amongst Lyons, Bears, and Wolves. The first author of Speech was <em>God</em> himself, that instructed <em>Adam</em> how to name such creatures as he presented to his sight; For the Scripture goeth no further in this matter. But this was sufficient to direct him to adde more names, as the experience and use of the creatures should give him occasion; and to joyn them in such manner by degrees, as to make himself understood; and so by succession of time, so much language might be gotten, as he had found use for; though not so copious, as an Orator or Philosopher has need of. For I do not find any thing in the Scripture, out of which, directly or by consequence can be gathered, that <em>Adam</em> was taught the names of all Figures, Numbers, Measures, Colours, Sounds, Fancies, Relations; much less the names of Words and Speech, as <em>Generall, Speciall, Affirmative, Negative, Interrogative, Optative, Infinitive</em>, all which are usefull; and least of all, of <em>Entity, Intentionality, Quiddity</em>, and other insignificant words of the School.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But all this language gotten, and augmented by <em>Adam</em> and his posterity, was again lost at the tower of <em>Babel</em>, when by the hand of God, every man was stricken for his rebellion, with an oblivion of his former language.

So that the first use of names, is to serve for <em>Markes</em>, or <em>Notes</em> of remembrance. Another is, when many use the same words, to signifie (by their connexion and order,) one to another, what they conceive, or think of each matter; and also what they desire, feare, or have any other passion for. And for this use they are called <em>Signes</em>. Speciall uses of Speech are these; First, to Register, what by cogitation, wee find to be the cause of any thing, present or past; and what we find things present or past may produce, or effect: which in summe, is acquiring of Arts. Secondly, to shew to others that knowledge which we have attained; which is, to Counsell, and Teach one another. Thirdly, to make known to others our wills, and purposes, that we may have the mutuall help of one another. Fourthly, to please and delight our selves, and others, by playing with our words, for pleasure or ornament, innocently.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Abuses of Speech.</em></span> To these Uses, there are also foure correspondent Abuses. First, when men register their thoughts wrong, by the inconstancy of the signification of their words; by which they register for their conceptions, that which they never conceived; and so deceive themselves. Secondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense than that they are ordained for; and thereby deceive others. Thirdly, when by words they declare that to be their will, which is not. Fourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature hath armed living creatures, some with teeth, some with horns, and some with hands, to grieve an enemy, it is but an abuse of Speech, to grieve him with the tongue, unlesse it be one whom wee are obliged to govern; and then it is not to grieve, but to correct and amend.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The manner how Speech serveth to the remembrance of the consequence of causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of <em>Names</em>, and the <em>Connexion</em> of them.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Names Proper &amp; Common.</em></span> Of Names, some are <em>Proper</em>, and singular to one onely thing; as <em>Peter, John, This man, this Tree</em>: and some are <em>Common</em> to many things; as <em>Man, Horse, Tree</em>; every of which though but one Name, is nevertheless the name of divers particular things; <span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Universall.</em></span> in respect of all which together, it is called an <em>Universall</em>; there being nothing in the world Universall but Names; for the things named, are every one of them Individuall and Singular.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One Universall name is imposed on many things, for their similitude in some quality, or other accident: And wheras a Proper Name bringeth to mind one thing onely; Universals recall any one of those many.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And of Names Universall, some are of more, and some of lesse extent; the larger comprehending the less large: and some again of equall extent, comprehending each other reciprocally. As for example, the Name <em>Body</em> is of larger signification than the word <em>Man</em>, and comprehendeth it; and the names <em>Man</em> and <em>Rationall</em>, are of equall extent, comprehending mutually one another. But here wee must take notice, that by a Name is not alwayes understood, as in Grammar, one onely Word; but sometimes by circumlocution many words together. For all these words, <em>Hee that in his actions observeth the Lawes of his Country</em>, make but one Name, equivalent to this one word, <em>Just</em>.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this imposition of Names, some of larger, some of stricter signification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences of things imagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the consequences of Appellations. For example, a man that hath no use of Speech at all, (such, as is born and remains perfectly deafe and dumb,) if he set before his eyes a triangle, and by it two right angles, (such as are the corners of a square figure,) he may by meditation compare and find, that the three angles of that triangle, are equall to those two right angles that stand by it. But if another triangle be shewn him different in shape from the former, he cannot know without a new labour, whether the three angles of that also be equall to the same. But he that hath the use of words, when he observes, that such equality was consequent, not to the length of the sides, nor to any other particular thing in his triangle; but onely to this, that the sides were straight, and the angles three; and that that was all, for which he named it a Triangle; will boldly conclude Universally, that such equality of angles is in all triangles whatsoever; and register his invention in these generall termes, <em>Every triangle hath its three angles equall to two right angles</em>. And thus the consequence found in one particular, comes to be registred and remembred, as an Universall rule; and discharges our mentall reckoning, of time and place; and delivers us from all labour of the mind, saving the first; and makes that which was found true <em>here</em>, and <em>now</em>, to be true in <em>all times</em> and <em>places</em>.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the use of words in registring our thoughts, is in nothing so evident as in Numbring. A naturall foole that could never learn by heart the order of numerall words, as <em>one, two</em>, and <em>three</em>, may observe every stroak of the Clock, and nod to it, or say one, one, one; but can never know what houre it strikes. And it seems, there was a time when those names of number were not in use; and men were fayn to apply their fingers of one or both hands, to those things they desired to keep account of; and that thence it proceeded, that now our numerall words are but ten, in any Nation, and in some but five, and then they begin again. And he that can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will lose himselfe, and not know when he has done: Much lesse will he be able to adde, and substract, and performe all other operations of Arithmetique. So that without words, there is no possibility of reckoning of Numbers; much lesse of Magnitudes, of Swiftnesse, of Force, and other things, the reckonings whereof are necessary to the being, or well-being of man-kind.","subId":"10","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When two Names are joyned together into a Consequence, or Affirmation; as thus, <em>A man is a living creature</em>; or thus, <em>if he be a man, he is a living creature</em>, If the later name <em>Living creature</em>, signifie all that the former name <em>Man</em> signifieth, then the affirmation, or consequence is <em>true</em>; otherwise <em>false</em>. For <em>True</em> and <em>False</em> are attributes of Speech, not of Things. And where Speech is not, there is neither <em>Truth</em> nor <em>Falshood.

And therefore in Geometry, (which is the onely Science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow on mankind,) men begin at settling the significations of their words; which settling of significations, they call <em>Definitions</em>; and place them in the beginning of their reckoning.","subId":"12","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true Knowledge, to examine the befinitions of former Authors; and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them himselfe. For the errours of Definitions multiply themselves, according as the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into absurdities, which at last they see, but cannot avoyd, without reckoning anew from the beginning; in which lyes the foundation of their errours. From whence it happens, that they which trust to books, do as they that cast up many little summs into a greater, without considering whether those little summes were rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the errour visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to cleere themselves; but spend time in fluttering over their bookes; as birds that entring by the chimney, and finding themselves inclosed in a chamber, flutter at the false light of a glasse window, for want of wit to consider which way they came in. So that in the right Definition of Names, lyes the first use of Speech; which is the Acquisition of Science: And in wrong, or no Definitions, lyes the first abuse; from which proceed all false and senslesse Tenets; which make those men that take their instruction from the authority of books, and not from their own meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant men, as men endued with true Science are above it. For between true Science, and erroneous Doctrines, Ignorance is in the middle. Naturall sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity. Nature it selfe cannot erre: and as men abound in copiousnesse of language; so they become more wise, or more mad than ordinary. Nor is it possible without Letters for any man to become either excellently wise, or (unless his memory be hurt by disease, or ill constitution of organs) excellently foolish. For words are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles, that value them by the authority of an <em>Aristotle</em>, a <em>Cicero</em>, or a <em>Thomas</em>, or any other Doctor whatsoever, if but a man.","subId":"13","id":"Hobbes.L.1.4.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Subject to Names.</em></span> <em>Subject to Names</em>, is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered in an account; and be added one to another to make a summe; or substracted one from another, and leave a remainder.
