For there was the <em>Tree of life</em>; whereof he was so long allowed to eat, as he should forbear to eat of the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evill; which was not allowed him. And therefore as soon as he had eaten of it, God thrust him out of Paradise, <em>lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and live for ever</em>. By which it seemeth to me, (with submission neverthelesse both in this, and in all questions, whereof the determination dependeth on the Scriptures, to the interpretation of the Bible authorized by the Common-wealth, whose Subject I am,) that Adam if he had not<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Gen. 3. 22.</em></span> sinned, had had an Eternall Life on Earth: and that Mortality entred upon himself, and his posterity, by his first Sin. Not that actuall Death then entred; for Adam then could never have had children; whereas he lived long after, and saw a numerous posterity ere he dyed. But where it is said, <em>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die</em>, it must needs bee meant of his Mortality, and certitude of death. Seeing then Eternall life was lost by Adams forfeiture, in committing sin, he that should cancell that forfeiture was to recover thereby, that Life again. Now Jesus Christ hath satisfied for the sins of all that beleeve in him; and therefore recovered to all beleevers, that <span class=\"small-capitals\">Eternall</span> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Life</span>, which was lost by the sin of Adam. And in this sense it is, that the comparison of St. Paul holdeth (<em>Rom</em>. 5. 18, 19.) <em>As by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men to Justification of Life</em>. Which is again (1 <em>Cor</em>. 15. 21, 22.) more perspicuously delivered in these words, <em>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive</em>.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Texts concerning the place of Life Eternall, for Beleevers.</em></span> Concerning the place wherein men shall enjoy that Eternall Life, which Christ hath obtained for them, the texts next before alledged seem to make it on Earth. For if as in Adam, all die, that is, have forfeited Paradise, and Eternall Life on Earth, even so in Christ all shall bee made alive; then all men shall be made to live on Earth; for else the comparison were not proper. Hereunto seemeth to agree that of the Psalmist, (<em>Psal</em>. 133. 3.) <em>Upon Zion God commanded the blessing, even Life for evermore</em>: for Zion, is in Jerusalem, upon Earth: as also that of S. Joh. (<em>Rev</em>. 2. 7.) <em>To him that overcommeth I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God</em>. This was the tree of Adams Eternall life; but his life was to have been on Earth. The same seemeth to be confirmed again by St. Joh. (<em>Rev</em>. 21. 2.) where he saith, <em>I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband:</em> and again v. 10. to the same effect: As if he should say, the new Jerusalem, the Paradise of God, at the coming again of Christ, should come down to Gods people from Heaven, and not they goe up to it from Earth. And this differs nothing from that, which the two men in white clothing (that is, the two Angels) said to the Apostles, that were looking upon Christ ascending (<em>Acts</em> I. II.) <em>This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him go up into Heaven</em>. Which soundeth as if they had said, he should come down to govern them under his Father, Eternally here; and not take them up to govern them in Heaven; and is conformable to the Restauration of the Kingdom of God, instituted under Moses; which was a Political government of the Jews on Earth. Again, that saying of our Saviour (<em>Mat</em>. 22. 30.) <em>that in the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven</em>, is a description of an Eternall Life, resembling that which we lost in Adam in the point of Marriage. For seeing Adam, and Eve, if they had not sinned, had lived on Earth Eternally, in their individuall persons; it is manifest, they should not continually have procreated their kind. For if Immortals should have generated, as Mankind doth now; the Earth in a small time, would not have been able to afford them place to stand on. The Jews that asked our Saviour the question, whose wife the woman that had married many brothers, should be, in the resurrection, knew not what were the consequences of Life Eternall: and therefore our Saviour puts them in mind of this consequence of Immortality; that there shal be no Generation, and consequently no marriage, no more than there is Marriage, or generation among the Angels. The comparison between that Eternall life which Adam lost, and our Saviour by his Victory over death hath recovered; holdeth also in this, that as Adam lost Eternall Life by his sin, and yet lived after it for a time; so the faithful Christian hath recovered Eternal Life by Christs passion, though he die a natural death, and remaine dead for a time; namely, till the Resurrection. For as Death is reckoned from the Condemnation of Adam, not from the Execution; so Life is reckoned from the Absolution, not from the Resurrection of them that are elected in Christ.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Ascension into heaven.</em></span> That the place wherein men are to live Eternally, after the Resurrection, is the Heavens, meaning by Heaven, those parts of the world, which are the most remote from Earth, as where the stars are, or above the stars, in another Higher Heaven, called <em>Cœlum Empyreum</em>, (whereof there is no mention in Scripture, nor ground in Reason) is not easily to be drawn from any text that I can find. By the Kingdome of Heaven, is meant the Kingdom of the King that dwelleth in Heaven; and his Kingdome was the people of Israel, whom he ruled by the Prophets his Lieutenants, first Moses, and after him Eleazar, and the Soveraign Priests, till in the days of Samuel they rebelled, and would have a mortall man for their King, after the manner of other Nations. And when our Saviour Christ, by the preaching of his Ministers, shall have perswaded the Jews to return, and called the Gentiles to his obedience, then shall there be a new Kingdom of Heaven; because our King shall then be God, whose <em>throne</em> is Heaven; without any necessity evident in the Scripture, that man shall ascend to his happinesse any higher than Gods <em>footstool</em>, the Earth. On the contrary, we find written (<em>Joh</em>. 3. 13.) that <em>no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, that is in Heaven</em>. Where I observe by the way, that these words are not, as those which go immediately before, the words of our Saviour, but of St. John himself; for Christ was then not in Heaven, but upon the Earth. The like is said of David (<em>Acts</em> 2. 34.) where St. Peter, to prove the Ascension of Christ, using the words of the Psalmist, (<em>Psal</em>. 16. 10.) <em>Thou wilt not leave my soule in Hell, nor suffer thine Holy one to see corruption</em>, saith, they were spoken (not of David, but) of Christ; and to prove it, addeth this Reason, <em>For David is not ascended into Heaven</em>. But to this a man may easily answer, and say, that though their bodies were not to ascend till the generall day of Judgment, yet their souls were in Heaven as soon as they were departed from their bodies; which also seemeth to be confirmed by the words of our Saviour (<em>Luke</em> 20. 37, 38.) who proving the Resurrection out of the words of Moses, saith thus, <em>That the dead are raised, even Moses shewed, at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the Dead, but of the Living; for they all live to him</em>. But if these words be to be understood only of the Immortality of the Soul, they prove not at all that which our Saviour intended to prove, which was the Resurrection of the Body, that is to say, the Immortality of the Man. Therefore our Saviour meaneth, that those Patriarchs were Immortall; not by a property consequent to the essence, and nature of mankind; but by the will of God, that was pleased of his mere grace, to bestow <em>Eternall life</em> upon the faithfull. And though at that time the Patriarchs and many other faithfull men were <em>dead</em>, yet as it is in the text, they <em>lived to God</em>; that is, they were written in the Book of Life with them that were absolved of their sinnes, and ordained to Life eternall at the Resurrection. That the Soul of man is in its own nature Eternall, and a living Creature independent on the body; or that any meer man is Immortall, otherwise than by the Resurrection in the last day, (except <em>Enos</em> and <em>Elias</em>,) is a doctrine not apparent in Scripture. The whole 14. Chapter of <em>Job</em>, which is the speech not of his friends, but of himselfe, is a complaint of this Mortality of Nature; and yet no contradiction of the Immortality at the Resurrection. <em>There is hope of a tree</em> (saith hee verse 7.) <em>if it be cast down, Though the root thereof wax old, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet when it senteth the water it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a Plant. But man dyeth, and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?</em> and (verse 12.) <em>man lyeth down, and riseth not, till the heavens be no more</em>. But when is it, that the heavens shall be no more? St. Peter tells us, that it is at the generall Resurrection. For in his 2. Epistle, 3. Chapter, and 7 verse, he saith, that <em>the Heavens and the Earth that are now, are reserved unto fire against the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men</em>, and (verse 12.) <em>looking for, and hasting to the comming of God, wherein the Heavens shall be on fire, and shall be dissolved, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat. Neverthelesse, we according to the promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse</em>. Therefore where Job saith, man riseth not till the Heavens be no more; it is all one, as if he had said, the Immortall Life (and Soule and Life in the Scripture, do usually signifie the same thing) beginneth not in man, till the Resurrection, and day of Judgement; and hath for cause, not his specificall nature, and generation; but the Promise. For St. Peter saies not, <em>Wee look for new heavens, and a new earth</em>, (<em>from Nature</em>,) but <em>from Promise</em>.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Lastly, seeing it hath been already proved out of divers evident places of Scripture, in the 35. chapter of this book, that the Kingdom of God is a Civil Common-wealth, where God himself is Soveraign, by vertue first of the <em>Olà</em>, and since of the <em>New</em> Covenant, wherein he reigneth by his Vicar, or Lieutenant; the same places do therefore also prove, that after the comming again of our Saviour in his Majesty, and glory, to reign actually, and Eternally; the Kingdom of God is to be on Earth. But because this doctrine (though proved out of places of Scripture not few, nor obscure) will appear to most men a novelty; I doe but propound it; maintaining nothing in this, or any other paradox of Religion; but attending the end of that dispute of the sword, concerning the Authority, (not yet amongst my Countreymen decided,) by which all sorts of doctrine are to bee approved, or rejected; and whose commands, both in speech, and writing, (whatsoever be the opinions of private men) must by all men, that mean to be protected by their Laws, be obeyed.

And amongst these bodily paines, is to be reckoned also to every one of the wicked a second Death.

The fire prepared for the wicked, is an Everlasting Fire: that is to say, the estate wherein no man can be without torture, both of body and mind, after the Resurrection, shall endure for ever; and in that sense the Fire shall be unquenchable, and the torments Everlasting: but it cannot thence be inferred, that hee who shall be cast into that fire, or be tormented with those torments, shall endure, and resist them so, as to be eternally burnt, and tortured, and yet never be destroyed, nor die. And though there be many places that affirm Everlasting Fire, and Torments (into which men may be cast successively one after another for ever; yet I find none that affirm there shall bee an Eternall Life therein of any individuall person; but to the contrary, an Everlasting Death, which is the Second Death: <em>For after Death, and the Grave shall have delivered</em><span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Apol. 20. 13, 14.</em></span> <em>up the dead which were in them, and every man be judged according to his works; Death and the Grave shall also be cast into the Lake of Fire.

The state of Salvation is described at large, <em>Isaiah</em> 33. ver. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.","subId":"19","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Look upon Zion, the City of our solemnities; thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken</em>.","subId":"20","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers, and streams; wherein shall goe no Gally with oares; neither shall gallant ship passe thereby</em>.","subId":"21","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will save us</em>.","subId":"22","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast; they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey</em>.","subId":"23","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>And the Inhabitant shall not say, I am sicke; the people that shall dwell therein shall be forgiven their Iniquity</em>.","subId":"24","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In which words wee have the place from whence Salvation is to proceed, <em>Jerusalem, a quiet habitation</em>; the Eternity of it, <em>a tabernacle that shall not be taken down</em>, &amp;c. The Saviour of it, <em>the Lord, their Judge, their Lawgiver, their King, he will save us</em>; the Salvation, <em>the Lord shall be to them as a broad mote of swift waters</em>, &amp;c. the condition of their Enemies, <em>their tacklings are loose, their masts weak, the lame shal take the spoil of them</em>. The condition of the Saved, <em>The Inhabitant shal not say, I am sick</em>: And lastly, all this is comprehended in Forgivenesse of sin, <em>The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity</em>. By which it is evident, that Salvation shall be on Earth, then, when God shall reign, (at the coming again of Christ) in Jerusalem; and from Jerusalem shall proceed the Salvation of the Gentiles that shall be received into Gods Kingdome: as is also more expressely declared by the same Prophet, Chap. 65. 20, 21. <em>And they</em> (that is, the Gentiles who had any Jew in bondage) <em>shall bring all your brethren, for an offering to the Lord, out of all nations, upon horses, and in charets, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the Children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessell into the House of the Lord. And I will also take of them for Priests and for Levites, saith the Lord</em>: Whereby it is manifest, that the chief seat of Gods Kingdome (which is the Place, from whence the Salvation of us that were Gentiles, shall proceed) shall be Jerusalem: And the same is also confirmed by our Saviour, in his discourse with the woman of Samaria, concerning the place of Gods worship; to whom he saith, <em>John</em> 4. 22. that the Samaritans worshipped they knew not what, but the Jews worship what they knew, <em>For Salvation is of the Jews</em> (<em>ex Judæis</em>, that is, begins at the Jews): as if he should say, you worship God, but know not by whom he wil save you, as we doe, that know it shall be by one of the tribe of Judah, a Jew, not a Samaritan. And therefore also the woman not impertinently answered him again, <em>We know the Messias shall come</em>. So that which our Saviour saith, <em>Salvation is from the Jews</em>, is the same that Paul sayes (<em>Rom</em>. 1. 16, 17.) <em>The Gospel is the power of God to Salvation to every one that beleeveth: To the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousnesse of God revealed from faith to faith</em>; from the faith of the Jew, to the faith of the Gentile. In the like sense the Prophet <em>Joel</em> describing the day of Judgment, (chap 2. 30, 31.) that God would <em>shew wonders in heaven, and in earth, bloud, and fire, and pillars of smoak. The Sun should be turned to darknesse, and the Moon into bloud, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come</em>, he addeth verse 32. <em>and it shall come to passe, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. For in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem shall be Salvation</em>. And <em>Obadiah</em> verse 17. saith the same, <em>Upon Mount Zion shall be Deliverance; and there shall be holinesse, and the house of Jacob shall possesse their possessions</em>, that is, the possessions of the <em>Heathen</em>, which <em>possessions</em> he expresseth more particularly in the following verses, by the <em>mount of Esau</em>, the <em>Land of the Philistines</em>, the <em>fields of Ephraim, of Samaria, Gilead</em>, and the <em>Cities of the South</em>, and concludes with these words, <em>the Kingdom shall be the Lords</em>. All these places are for Salvation, and the Kingdome of God (after the day of Judgement) upon Earth. On the other side, I have not found any text that can probably be drawn, to prove any Ascension of the Saints into Heaven; that is to say, into any <em>Cælum Empyreum</em>, or other ætheriall Region; saving that it is called the Kingdome of Heaven: which name it may have, because God, that was King of the Jews, governed them by his commands, sent to Moses by Angels from Heaven; and after their revolt, sent his Son from Heaven, to reduce them to their obedience; and shall send him thence again, to rule both them, and all other faithfull men, from the day of Judgment, Everlastingly: or from that, that the Throne of this our Great King is in Heaven; whereas the Earth is but his Footstoole. But that the Subjects of God should have any place as high as his Throne, or higher than his Footstoole, it seemeth not sutable to the dignity of a King, nor can I find any evident text for it in holy Scripture.","subId":"25","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"From this that hath been said of the Kingdom of God, and of Salvation, it is not hard to interpret what is meant by the <span class=\"small-capitals\">World to come</span>.

And seeing the person offended, is Almighty God, in whose power are all things; such Ransome is to be paid before Salvation can be acquired, as God hath been pleased to require. By this Ransome, is not intended a satisfaction for Sin, equivalent to the Offence, which no sinner for himselfe, nor righteous man can ever be able to make for another: The dammage a man does to another, he may make amends for by restitution, or recompence, but sin cannot be taken away by recompence; for that were to make the liberty to sin, a thing vendible. But sins may bee pardoned to the repentant, either <em>gratis</em>, or upon such penalty, as God is pleased to accept. That which God usually accepted in the Old Testament, was some Sacrifice, or Oblation. To forgive sin is not an act of Injustice, though the punishment have been threatned. Even amongst men, though the promise of Good, bind the promiser; yet threats, that is to say, promises of Evill, bind them not; much lesse shall they bind God, who is infinitely more merciful then men. Our Saviour Christ therefore to <em>Redeem</em> us, did not in that sense satisfie for the Sins of men, as that his Death, of its own vertue, could make it unjust in God to punish sinners with Eternall death; but did make that Sacrifice, and Oblation of himself, at his first coming, which God was pleased to require, for the Salvation at his second coming, of such as in the mean time should repent, and beleeve in him. And though this act of our <em>Redemption</em>, be not alwaies in Scripture called a <em>Sacrifice</em>, and <em>Oblation</em>, but sometimes a <em>Price</em>; yet by <em>Price</em> we are not to understand any thing, by the value whereof, he could claim right to a pardon for us, from his offended Father; but that Price which God the Father was pleased in mercy to demand.","subId":"27","id":"Hobbes.L.3.38.27"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.L.3","imported":true,"title":"The Third Part, Of A Christian Common-wealth","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1651]}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.37","imported":true,"title":"Of Miracles, and their Use","breadcrumb":"Chapter 37","published":[1651]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.39","imported":true,"title":"Of the signification in Scripture of the word Church","breadcrumb":"Chapter 39","published":[1651]}}
