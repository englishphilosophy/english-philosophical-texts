And therefore a Church, such a one as is capable to Command, to Judge, Absolve, Condemn, or do any other act, is the same thing with a Civil Common-wealth, consisting of Christian men; and is called a <em>Civill State</em>, for that the subjects of it are <em>Men</em>; and a <em>Church</em>, for that the subjects thereof are <em>Christians. Temporall</em> and <em>Spirituall</em> Government, are but two words brought into the world, to make men see double, and mistake their <em>Lawfull Soveraign</em>. It is true, that the bodies of the faithfull, after the Resurrection, shall be not onely Spirituall, but Eternall: but in this life they are grosse, and corruptible. There is therefore no other Government in this life, neither of State, nor Religion, but Temporall; nor teaching of any doctrine, lawfull to any Subject, which the Governour both of the State, and of the Religion, forbiddeth to be taught: And that Governor must be one; or else there must needs follow Faction, and Civil war in the Common-wealth, between the <em>Church</em> and <em>State</em>; between <em>Spiritualists</em>, and <em>Temporalists</em>; between the <em>Sword of Justice</em>, and the <em>Shield of Faith</em>; and (which is more) in every Christian mans own brest, between the <em>Christian</em>, and the <em>Man</em>. The Doctors of the Church, are called Pastors; so also are Civill Soveraignes: But if Pastors be not subordinate one to another, so as that there may bee one chief Pastor, men will be taught contrary Doctrines, whereof both may be, and one must be false. Who that one chief Pastor is, according to the law of Nature, hath been already shewn; namely, that it is the Civill Soveraign: And to whom the Scripture hath assigned that Office, we shall see in the Chapters following.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.L.3.39.5"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore Politico"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Cive"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Libertie and Necessitie"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Behemoth"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Answer to Bramhall"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.L.3","imported":true,"title":"The Third Part, Of A Christian Common-wealth","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1651]}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.38","imported":true,"title":"Of the Signification in Scripture of Eternall Life, Hell, Salvation, The World to come, and Redemption","breadcrumb":"Chapter 38","published":[1651]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.40","imported":true,"title":"Of the Rights of the Kingdome of God, in Abraham, Moses, the High Priests, and the Kings of Judah","breadcrumb":"Chapter 40","published":[1651]}}
