And <cite><em>Acts</em> 5. 20.</cite> where it is said to the Apostles by an Angel, <em>Go stand and speak in the Temple, all the Words of this life</em>; by the Words of this life, is meant, the Doctrine of the Gospel; as is evident by what they did in the Temple, and is expressed in the last verse of the same Chap. <em>Daily in the Temple, and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach Christ Jesus</em>: In which place it is manifest, that Jesus Christ was the subject of this <em>Word of life</em>; or (which is all one) the subject of the <em>Words of this life eternall</em>, that our Saviour offered them. So <cite><em>Acts</em> 15. 7.</cite> the Word of God, is called <em>the Word of the Gospel</em>, because it containeth the Doctrine of the Kingdome of Christ; and the same Word <cite><em>Rom</em>. 10. 8, 9.</cite> is called <em>the Word of Faith</em>; that is, as is there expressed, the Doctrine of Christ come, and raised from the dead.

For example, though these words, <em>I am the Lord thy God, &amp;c</em>. to the end of the Ten Commandements, were spoken by God to Moses; yet the Preface, <em>God spake these words and said</em>, is to be understood for the Words of him that wrote the holy History.

So also <cite>1 <em>King</em>. 18. 36.</cite> Elijah saith to God, <em>I have done all these thy Words</em>, in stead of <em>I have done all these things at thy Word</em>, or commandement: and <cite><em>Jer</em>. 17. 15.</cite> <em>Where is the Word of the Lord</em>, is put for, <em>Where is the Evill he threatned</em>: And <cite><em>Ezek</em>. 12. 28.</cite> <em>There shall none of my Words be prolonged any more</em>: by <em>words</em> are understood those <em>things</em>, which God promised to his people. And in the New Testament <cite><em>Mat</em>. 24. 35.</cite> <em>heaven and earth shal pass away, but my Words shal not pass away</em>; that is, there is nothing that I have promised or foretold, that shall not come to passe. And in this sense it is, that St. John the Evangelist, and, I think, St. John onely calleth our Saviour himself as in the flesh <em>the Word of God</em> <cite>as <em>Joh</em>. 1. 14.</cite> <em>the Word was made Flesh</em>; that is to say, the Word, or Promise that Christ should come into the world; <em>who in the beginning was with God</em>; that is to say, it was in the purpose of God the Father, to send God the Son into the world, to enlighten men in the way of Eternall life; but it was not till then put in execution, and actually incarnate; So that our Saviour is there called <em>the Word</em>, not because he was the promise, but the thing promised. They that taking occasion from this place, doe commonly call him the Verbe of God, do but render the text more obscure. They might as well term him the Nown of God: for as by <em>Nown</em>, so also by <em>Verbe</em>, men understand nothing but a part of speech, a voice, a sound, that neither affirms, nor denies, nor commands, nor promiseth, nor is any substance corporeall, or spirituall; and therefore it cannot be said to bee either God, or Man; whereas our Saviour is both. And this <em>Word</em> which St. <em>John</em> in his Gospel saith was with God, is <cite>in his 1 Epistle, verse 1.</cite> called the <em>Word of life</em>; and <cite>verse 2.</cite> <em>the Eternall life, which was with the Father</em>: so that he can be in no other sense called the <em>Word</em>, then in that, wherein he is called Eternall life; that is, <em>he that hath procured us Eternall life</em>, by his comming in the flesh. So also <cite><em>Apocalypse</em> 19. 13.</cite> the Apostle speaking of Christ, clothed in a garment dipt in bloud, faith; his name is <em>the Word of God</em>; which is to be understood, as if he had said his name had been, <em>He that was come according to the purpose of God from the beginning, and according to his Word and promises delivered by the Prophets</em>. So that there is nothing here of the Incarnation of a Word, but of the Incarnation of God the Son,<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Acts 1. 4.

For Pharaoh Necho was an Idolater; yet his Words to the good King Josiah, in which he advised him by Messengers, not to oppose him in his march against <em>Carchemish</em>, are said to have proceeded from the mouth of God; and that Josiah not hearkning to them, was slain in the battle; as is to be read 2 <em>Chron</em>. 35. vers. 21, 22, 23.

It is most frequently used in the sense of speaking from God to the People. So <em>Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah</em>, and others were <em>Prophets</em>. And in this sense the High Priest was a <em>Prophet</em>, for he only went into the <em>Sanctum Sanctorum</em>, to enquire of God; and was to declare his answer to the people. And therefore when Caiphas said, it was expedient that one man should die for the people, St. John saith <cite>chap. 11. 51.</cite> that <em>He spake not this of himselfe, but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that one man should dye for the nation</em>. Also they that in Christian Congregations taught the people <cite>1 <em>Cor</em>. 14. 3.</cite> are said to Prophecy. In the like sense it is, that God saith to <em>Moses</em> <cite><em>Exod</em>. 4. 16.</cite> concerning <em>Aaron, He shall be thy Spokes-man to the People; and he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God</em>: that which here is <em>Spokes-man</em>, is <cite>chap. 7. 1.</cite> interpreted Prophet; <em>See</em> (saith God) <em>I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy Prophet</em>. In the sense of speaking from man to God Abraham is called a Prophet <cite><em>Genes</em>. 20. 7.</cite> where God in a Dream speaketh to Abimelech in this manner, <em>Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and shall pray for thee</em>; whereby may be also gathered, that the name of Prophet may be given, not unproperly to them that in Christian Churches, have a Calling to say publique prayers for the Congregation. In the same sense, the Prophets that came down from the High place (or Hill of God) with a Psaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe, and a Harp <cite>1 <em>Sam</em>. 10. 5, 6.</cite> and <cite>vers. 10.</cite> Saul amongst them, are said to Prophecy, in that they praised God, in that manner publiquely. In the like sense, is Miriam <cite><em>Exod</em>. 15. 20.</cite> called a Prophetesse. So is it also to be taken <cite>1 <em>Cor</em>. 11. 4, 5.</cite> where St. Paul saith, <em>Every man that prayeth or prophecyeth with his head covered, &amp;c. and every woman that prayeth or prophecyeth with her head uncovered</em>: For Prophecy in that place, signifieth no more, but praising God in Psalmes, and Holy Songs; which women might doe in the Church, though it were not lawfull for them to speak to the Congregation. And in this signification it is, that the Poets of the Heathen, that composed Hymnes and other sorts of Poems in the honor of their Gods, were called <em>Vates</em> (Prophets) as is well enough known by all that are versed in the Books of the Gentiles, and as is evident <cite><em>Tit</em>. 1. 12.</cite> where St. Paul saith of the Cretians, that a Prophet of their owne said, they were Liars; not that St. Paul held their Poets for Prophets, but acknowledgeth that the word Prophet was commonly used to signifie them that celebrated the honour of God in Verse.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>Prædiction of future contingents, not alwaies Prophecy.</em></span> When by Prophecy is meant Prædiction, or foretelling of future Contigents; not only they were Prophets, who were Gods Spokes-men, and foretold those things to others, which God had foretold to them; but also all those Impostors, that pretend by the helpe of familiar spirits, or by superstitious divination of events past, from false causes, to foretell the like events in time to come: of which (as I have declared already in the 12. chapter of this Discourse) there be many kinds, who gain in the opinion of the common sort of men, a greater reputation of Prophecy, by one casuall event that may bee but wrested to their purpose, than can be lost again by never so many failings. Prophecy is not an Art, nor (when it is taken for Prædiction) a constant Vocation; but an extraordinary, and temporary Employment from God, most often of Good men, but sometimes also of the Wicked. The woman of Endor, who is said to have had a familiar spirit, and thereby to have raised a Phantasme of Samuel, and foretold Saul his death, was not therefore a Prophetesse; for neither had she any science, whereby she could raise such a Phantasme; nor does it appear that God commanded the raising of it; but onely guided that Imposture to be a means of Sauls terror and discouragement; and by consequent, of the discomfiture, by which he fell. And for Incoherent Speech, it was amongst the Gentiles taken for one sort of Prophecy, because the Prophets of their Oracles, intoxicated with a spirit, or vapor from the cave of the Pythian Oracle at Delphi, were for the time really mad, and spake like madmen; of whose loose words a sense might be made to fit any event, in such sort, as all bodies are said to be made of <em>Materia prima</em>. In the Scripture I find it also so taken <cite>1 <em>Sam</em>. 18. 10.</cite> in these words, <em>And the Evill spirit came upon Saul, and he Prophecyed in the midst of the house</em>.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>The manner how God hath spoken to the Prophets.</em></span> And although there be so many significations in Scripture of the word <em>Prophet</em>; yet is that the most frequent, in which it is taken for him, to whom God speaketh immediately, that which the Prophet is to say from him, to some other man, or to the people. And hereupon a question may be asked, in what manner God speaketh to such a Prophet. Can it (may some say) be properly said, that God hath voice and language, when it cannot be properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a man? The Prophet David argueth thus, <em>Shall he that made the eye, not see</em>? <em>or he that made the ear, not hear</em>? But this may be spoken, not (as usually) to signifie Gods nature, but to signifie our intention to honor him. For to <em>see</em>, and <em>hear</em>, are Honorable Attributes, and may be given to God, to declare (as far as our capacity can conceive) his Almighty power. But if it were to be taken in the strict, and proper sense, one might argue from his making of all other parts of mans body, that he had also the same use of them which we have; which would be many of them so uncomely, as it would be the greatest contumely in the world to ascribe them to him. Therefore we are to interpret Gods speaking to men immediately, for that way (whatsoever it be), by which God makes them understand his will: And the wayes whereby he doth this, are many; and to be sought onely in the Holy Scripture: where though many times it be said, that God spake to this, and that person, without declaring in what manner; yet there be again many places, that deliver also the signes by which they were to acknowledge his presence, and commandement; and by these may be understood, how he spake to many of the rest.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In what manner God spake to <em>Adam</em>, and <em>Eve</em>,<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>To the Extraordinary Prophets of the Old Testament he spake by Dreams, or Visions.</em></span> and <em>Cain</em>, and <em>Noah</em>, is not expressed; nor how he spake to <em>Abraham</em>, till such time as he came out of his own countrey to <em>Sichem</em> in the land of <em>Canaan</em>; and then <cite><em>Gen</em>. 12. 7.</cite> God is said to have <em>appeared</em> to him.

For there was <cite>verse 27.</cite> a complaint made against them to Moses; and Joshua would have Moses to have forbidden them; which he did not, but said to Joshua, Bee not jealous in my behalf.

It is meant therefore of the Gift and Grace of God, that guided them to co-operate with Moses; from whom their Spirit was derived. And it appeareth <cite>verse 16.</cite> that, they were such as Moses himself should appoint for Elders and Officers of the People: For the words are, <em>Gather unto me seventy men, whom thou knowest to be Elders and Officers of the people</em>: where, <em>thou knowest</em>, is the same with <em>thou appointest</em>, or <em>hast appointed to be such</em>. For we are told before <cite><em>Exod</em>. 18.</cite> that Moses following the counsell of Jethro his Father-in-law, did appoint Judges, and Officers over the people, such as feared God; and of these, were those Seventy, whom God by putting upon them Moses spirit, inclined to aid Moses in the Administration of the Kingdome: and in this sense the Spirit of God is said <cite>1 <em>Sam</em>. 16. 13, 14.</cite> presently upon the anointing of David, to have come upon David, and left Saul; God giving his graces to him he chose to govern his people, and taking them away from him, he rejected. So that by the Spirit is meant Inclination to Gods service; and not any supernaturall Revelation.","subId":"16","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>God sometimes also spake by Lots.</em></span> God spake also many times by the event of Lots; which were ordered by such as he had put in Authority over his people.

And consequently men had need to be very circumspect, and wary, in obeying the voice of man, that pretending himself to be a Prophet, requires us to obey God in that way, which he in Gods name telleth us to be the way to happinesse. For he that pretends to teach men the way of so great felicity, pretends to govern them; that is to say, to rule, and reign over them; which is a thing, that all men naturally desire, and is therefore worthy to be suspected of Ambition and Imposture; and consequently, ought to be examined, and tryed by every man, before hee yeeld them obedience; unlesse he have yeelded it them already, in the institution of a Common-wealth; as when the Prophet is the Civill Soveraign, or by the Civil Soveraign Authorized. And if this examination of Prophets, and Spirits, were not allowed to every one of the people, it had been to no purpose, to set out the marks, by which every man might be able, to distinguish between those, whom they ought, and those whom they ought not to follow. Seeing therefore such marks are set out (<em>Deut</em>. 13. 1, &amp;c.] to know a Prophet by; and <cite>1 <em>John</em> 4. 1. &amp;c.</cite> to know a Spirit by: and seeing there is so much Prophecying in the Old Testament; and so much Preaching in the New Testament against Prophets; and so much greater a number ordinarily of false Prophets, then of true; every one is to beware of obeying their directions, at their own perill. And first, that there were many more false then true Prophets, appears by this, that when Ahab <cite>I <em>Kings</em> 12.</cite> consulted four hundred Prophets, they were all false Impostors, but onely one Michaiah. And a little before the time of the Captivity, the Prophets were generally lyars. <em>The Prophets</em> (saith the Lord by <em>Jeremy</em>, cha. 14, verse 14.) <em>prophecy Lies in my name. I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor spake unto them, they prophecy to you a false Vision, a thing of naught; and the deceit of their heart</em>. In so much as God commanded the People by the mouth of the Prophet <em>Jeremiah</em> <cite>chap. 23. 16.</cite> not to obey them. <em>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, hearken not unto the words of the Prophets, that prophecy to you. They make you vain, they speak a Vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord</em>.","subId":"19","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"margin-comment\"><em>All prophecy but of the Soveraign Prophet is to be examined by every Subject.</em></span> Seeing then there was in the time of the Old Testament, such quarrells amongst the Visionary Prophets, one contesting with another, and asking, When departed the Spirit from me, to go to thee? as between Michaiah, and the rest of the four hundred; and such giving of the Lye to one another, (as in <em>Jerem</em>. 14. 14.) and such controversies in the New Testament at this day, amongst the Spirituall Prophets: Every man then was, and now is bound to make use of his Naturall Reason, to apply to all Prophecy those Rules which God hath given us, to discern the true from the false. Of which Rules, in the Old Testament, one was, conformable doctrine to that which Moses the Soveraign Prophet had taught them; and the other the miraculous power of foretelling what God would bring to passe, as I have already shewn out of <em>Deut</em>. 13. I. &amp;<em>c</em>. And in the New Testament there was but one onely mark; and that was the preaching of this Doctrine, <em>That Jesus is the Christ</em>, that is, the King of the Jews, promised in the Old Testament. Whosoever denyed that Article, he was a false Prophet, whatsoever miracles he might seem to work; and he that taught it was a true Prophet. For St. <em>John</em> <cite>I Epist. 4. 2, &amp;c.</cite> speaking expressely of the means to examine Spirits, whether they be of God, or not; after he had told them that there would arise false Prophets, saith thus, <em>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God. Every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God</em>; that is, is approved and allowed as a Prophet of God: not that he is a godly man, or one of the Elect, for this, that he confesseth, professeth, or preacheth Jesus to be the Christ; but for that he is a Prophet avowed. For God sometimes speaketh by Prophets, whose persons he hath not accepted; as he did by Baalam; and as he foretold Saul of his death, by the Witch of Endor. Again in the next verse, <em>Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of Christ. And this is the Spirit of Antichrist</em>. So that the Rule is perfect on both sides; that he is a true Prophet, which preacheth the Messiah already come, in the person of Jesus; and he a false one that denyeth him come, and looketh for him in some future Impostor, that shall take upon him that honour falsely, whom the Apostle there properly calleth Antichrist. Every man therefore ought to consider who is the Soveraign Prophet; that is to say, who it is, that is Gods Vicegerent on Earth; and hath next under God, the Authority of Governing Christian men; and to observe for a Rule, that Doctrine, which in the name of God, hee hath commanded to bee taught; and thereby to examine and try out the truth of those Doctrines, which pretended Prophets with miracle, or without, shall at any time advance: and if they find it contrary to that Rule, to doe as they did, that came to Moses, and complained that there were some that Prop<cite>h</cite>ecyed in the Campe, whose Authority so to doe they doubted of; and leave to the Soveraign, as they did to Moses to uphold, or to forbid them, as hee should see cause; and if hee disavow them, then no more to obey their voice; or if he approve them, then to obey them, as men to whom God hath given a part of the Spirit of their Soveraigne. For when Christian men, take not their Christian Soveraign, for Gods Prophet; they must either take their owne Dreames, for the Prophecy they mean to bee governed by, and the tumour of their own hearts for the Spirit of God; or they must suffer themselves to bee lead by some strange Prince; or by some of their fellow subjects, that can bewitch them, by slaunder of the government, into rebellion, without other miracle to confirm their calling, then sometimes an extraordinary successe, and Impunity; and by this means destroying all laws, both divine, and humane, reduce all Order, Government, and Society, to the first Chaos of Violence, and Civill warre.","subId":"20","id":"Hobbes.L.3.36.20"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hobbes.L.3","imported":true,"title":"The Third Part, Of A Christian Common-wealth","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1651]}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.35","imported":true,"title":"Of the Signification in Scripture of Kingdome Of God, of Holy, Sacred, and Sacrament","breadcrumb":"Chapter 35","published":[1651]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.L.3.37","imported":true,"title":"Of Miracles, and their Use","breadcrumb":"Chapter 37","published":[1651]}}
