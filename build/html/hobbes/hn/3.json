The Reason is, That which obscured and made the Conceptions weak, namely Sense, and present <em>Operation</em> of the Object, is <em>removed:</em> for <em>Sleep</em> is the <em>Privation of the Act of Sense,</em> (the Power remaining) and <em>Dreams</em> are the <em>Imagination</em> of them that <em>sleep.</em>","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <em>Causes</em> of Dreams (if they be natural) are the <em>Actions</em> or Violence of the <em>inward</em> Parts of a man upon his <em>Brain,</em> by which the <em>Passages</em> of Sense by Sleep <em>benummed,</em> are <em>restored</em> to their Motion. The Signs by which this appeareth to be so, are the <em>Differences</em> of Dreams (old Men commonly dream oftener, and have their Dreams more painful than young) proceeding from the <em>different</em> Accidents of Mans Body; as Dreams of <em>Lust,</em> as Dreams of <em>Anger,</em> according as the Heart, or other Parts within, work more or less upon the Brain, by more or less <em>Heat</em>; so also the Descents of different <em>sorts of Flegm</em> maketh us a Dream of different Tastes of Meats and Drinks; and I believe there is a <em>Reciprocation</em> of Motion from the Brain to the Vital Parts, and back from the Vital Parts to the Brain; whereby not only <em>Imagination</em> begetteth <em>Motion</em> in those Parts; but also Motion in those Parts begetteth Imagination like to that by which it was begotten. If this be true, and that <em>sad</em> Imaginations nourish the <em>Spleen,</em> then we see also a Cause, why a strong <em>Spleen</em> reciprocally causeth <em>fearful Dreams,</em> and why the Effects of <em>Lasciviousness</em> may in a Dream produce the Image of some person that had <em>caused</em> them. Another Sign that Dreams are caused by the Action of the inward Parts, is the <em>Disorder</em> and casual Consequence of one Conception or Image to another: for when we are <em>waking,</em> the <em>Antecedent</em> thought or Conception introduceth, and is cause of the <em>Consequent,</em> (as the Water followeth a mans Finger upon a dry and level Table (but in <em>Dreams</em> there is commonly <em>no Coherence,</em> (and when there is, it is by Chance) which must needs proceed from this, That the <em>Brain</em> in Dreams is <em>not restored</em> to its Motion in every Part alike; whereby it cometh to pass, that our Thoughts appear like the Stars between the flying Clouds, not in the Order which a Man would chuse to observe them, but as the uncertain Flight of broken Clouds permits.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As when the <em>Water,</em> or any liquid Thing moved at once by <em>divers</em> Movents, receiveth <em>one</em> Motion compounded of them all; so also the <em>Brain</em> or Spirit therein, having been stirred by <em>divers</em> Objects, composeth an Imagination of <em>divers</em> Conceptions that appeared single to the Sense. As for Example, the Sense sheweth at one Time the Figure of a <em>Mountain,</em> and at another Time the Colour of <em>Gold</em>; but the Imagination afterwards hath them both at once in a <em>golden Mountain.</em> From the same Cause it is, there appear unto us <em>Castles</em> in the <em>Air, Chimaera's,</em> and other Monsters which are <em>not</em> in <em>Rerum Natura, but</em> have been conceived by the Sense in Pieces at several Times.

An Example whereof is, the <em>Image</em> remaining before the <em>Eye</em> after looking upon the <em>Sun.</em> Also, those little Images that appear before the Eyes in the <em>dark</em>; whereof I think every Man hath Experience, (but they most of all, who are <em>timorous</em> or superstitious) are Examples of the same.

In Process of Time, the <em>Image</em> of the City <em>returneth</em> but as a <em>Mass</em> of Building <em>only,</em> which is <em>almost</em> to have <em>forgotten</em> it.
