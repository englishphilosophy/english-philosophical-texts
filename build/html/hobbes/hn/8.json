Concerning the Delight of <em>Hearing,</em> it is diverse, and the Organ it self not affected thereby: <em>Simple Sounds</em> please by <em>Æquality,</em> as the Sound of a Bell or Lute: insomuch as it seems, an Equality continued by the Percussion of the Object upon the Ear, is Pleasure; the Contrary is called <em>Harshness,</em> such as is Grating, and some other Sounds, which do not always affect the Body, but only sometime, and that with a Kind of Horrour beginning at the Teeth. <em>Harmony,</em> or many Sounds together agreeing, please by the same Reason as the <em>Vnison,</em> which is the Sound of equal Strings equally stretched. Sounds that differ in any <em>Height,</em> please by <em>Inequality and Æquality alternate,</em> that is to say, the higher Note striketh twice, for one Stroke of the other, whereby they strike together every second Time; as is well proved by <em>Galileo,</em> in the first Dialogue concerning local Motion: where he also sheweth, that two Sounds differing a <em>fifth,</em> delight the Ear by an <em>Æquality</em> of striking <em>after two Inequalities</em>; for the higher Note striketh the Ear thrice, while the other strikes but twice. In like Manner he sheweth wherein consisteth the Pleasure of Concord, and the Displeasure of Discord, in other Difference of Notes. There is yet <em>another</em> Pleasure and Displeasure of Sounds, which consisteth in <em>Consequence of one Note after another, diversified</em> both by <em>Accent</em> and <em>Measure</em>; whereof that which pleaseth is called <em>Air</em>; but for what Reason Succession in Tone and Measure is more Air than another, I confess I know not; but I conjecture the Reason to be, for that some of them imitate and revive some Passion which otherwise we take no Notice of, and the other not; for <em>no Air pleaseth but for a time,</em> no more doth Imitation. Also the Pleasures of the <em>Eye</em> consist in a certain <em>Æquality</em> of <em>Colour:</em> for <em>Light,</em> the most glorious of all Colours, is made by <em>equal</em> Operation of the Object; whereas <em>Colour</em> is <em>perturbed,</em> that is to say, unequal Light, as hath been said, <em>Chap.</em> 2. <em>Sect.</em> 8. And therefore Colours, the more Equality is in them, the more resplendent they are: and as <em>Harmony</em> is pleasure to the <em>Ear,</em> which consisteth of <em>divers Sounds</em>; so perhaps may some Mixture of <em>divers Colours</em> be <em>Harmony</em> to the <em>Eye,</em> more than another Mixture. There is yet another Delight by the <em>Ear,</em> which happeneth onely to Men of skill in Musick, which is of another Nature, (and not as these) Conception of the present, but rejoycing of their own Skill; of which nature are the Passions of which I am to speak next.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Conception of the <em>future,</em> is but a <em>Supposition</em> of the <em>same,</em> proceeding from <em>Remembrance</em> of what is past; and we so far <em>conceive</em> that any Thing <em>will be hereafter,</em> as we <em>know</em> there is <em>something at the present</em> that hath Power to produce it: and that any Thing hath Power now to produce another Thing hereafter, we cannot conceive, but by Remembrance that it hath produced the like heretofore. Wherefore all Conception of future, is Conception of Power able to produce something. Whosoever therefore expecteth Pleasure to come, must conceive withal some Power in himself by which the same may be attained. And because the Passions, whereof I am to speak next, consist in Conception of the future, that is to say, in Conception of Power past, and the Act to come; before I go any further, I must in the next Place speak somewhat concerning this Power.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this Power I mean the same with the Faculties of the <em>Body, Nutritive, Generative, Motive,</em> and of the <em>Mind, Knowledge</em>; and besides these, such <em>further</em> Power as by them is acquired, <em>viz.

The <em>Contraries</em> of these are <em>Impotencies, Infirmities,</em> or <em>Defects</em> of the said Powers respectively. And because the Power of one Man resisteth and hindereth the Effects of the Power of another, <em>Power</em> simply is no more, but the <em>Excess</em> of the Power of one above that of another: for equal Powers opposed, destroy one another; and such their Opposition is called Contention.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <em>Signs</em> by which we know our own <em>Power,</em> are those <em>Actions</em> which proceed from the same; and the Signs by which <em>other Men</em> know it, are such <em>Actions, Gesture, Countenance</em> and <em>Speech,</em> as usually such Powers produce: and the <em>Acknowledgement</em> of Power is called Honour; and to honour a Man inwardly, is to conceive or acknowledge that that Man hath the odds or Excess of that Power above him with whom he contendeth or compareth himself. And honourable are those Signs for which one Man acknowledgeth Power or Excess above his Concurrent in another: As for Example, <em>Beauty</em> of Person, consisting in a lively Aspect of the Countenance, and other <em>Signs</em> of <em>Natural Heat,</em> are honourable, being Signs precedent of Power <em>generative,</em> and much Issue; as also, general Reputation among those of the other Sex, because Signs consequent of the same. And Actions proceeding from <em>Strength of Body,</em> and open Force, are honourable, as Signs consequent of Power <em>motive,</em> such as are Victory in Battel or Duel; <em>A d'avoir tué son homme.</em> Also to adventure upon great Exploits and Danger, as being a Sign consequent of Opinion of our own Strength, and that Opinion a Sign of the Strength it self. And to teach or perswade are honourable, because they be Signs of <em>Knowledge.</em> And Riches are honourable; as Signs of the Power that acquired them: And Gifts, Cost, and Magnificence of Houses, Apparel, and the like, are honourable, as Signs of Riches. And <em>Nobility</em> is honourable by Reflection, as a Sign of Power in the Ancestors: And <em>Authority,</em> because a Sign of the Strength, Wisdom, Favour or Riches by which it is attained. And <em>Good Fortune</em> or casual Prosperity is honourable, because a Sign of the Favour of God, to whom is to be ascribed all that cometh to us by Fortune, no less than that we attain unto by Industry.
