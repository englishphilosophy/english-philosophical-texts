The Experience we have hereof, is in such Brute Beasts, which, having the providence to hide the Remains and Superfluity of their Meat, do nevertheless want the Remembrance of the Place where they hide it, and thereby make no Benefit thereof in their Hunger: but Man, who in this Point beginneth to rank himself somewhat above the Nature of Beasts, hath observed and remembred the Cause of this Defect, and to amend the same, hath imagined or devised to set up a visible or other sensible Mark, the which, when he seeth it again, may bring to his Mind the Thought he had when he set it up. A <em>Mark</em> therefore is a <em>sensible Object</em> which a Man erecteth voluntarily to himself, to the End to <em>remember</em> thereby somewhat past, when the same is objected to his Sense again: As men that have past by a Rock at Sea, set up some Mark, thereby to remember their former Danger, and avoid it.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the Number of these <em>Marks,</em> are those <em>Humane Voices,</em> which we call the <em>Names</em> or Appellations of Things sensible by the Ear, by which we recall into our Mind some Conceptions of the Things to which we gave those Names or Appellations; as the Appellation <em>White</em> bringeth to remembrance the Quality of such Objects as produce that Colour or Conception in us. A <em>Name</em> or Appellation therefore is the <em>Voice</em> of a Man <em>arbitrary,</em> imposed for a <em>Mark</em> to bring into his Mind some Conception concerning the thing on which it is imposed.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Things named, are either the <em>Objects</em> themselves, as a Man; or the <em>Conception</em> it self that we have of Man, as Shape and Motion: or some Privation, which is when we conceive that there is something which we conceive not, in him; as when we conceive he is not just, not finite, we give him the Name of unjust, of infinite, which signifie Privation or Defect; and to the Privations themselves we give the Names of Injustice and Infiniteness: so that here be <em>Two Sorts</em> of Names; One of <em>Things,</em> in which we conceive something; or of the Conceptions themselves, which are called <em>positive</em>: the other of Things wherein we conceive <em>Privation</em> or Defect, and those Names are called <em>Privative.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By the Advantage of <em>Names</em> it is that we are capable of <em>Science,</em> which Beasts, for want of them are not; nor Man, without the Use of them: for as a Beast misseth not one or two out of many her young Ones, for want of those Names of order, One, Two, and Three, and which we call <em>Number</em>; so neither would a Man, without repeating orally or mentally the Words of Number, know how many Pieces of Money or other Things lie before him.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Seeing there be <em>many</em> Conceptions of <em>one</em> and the same Thing, and for <em>every</em> Conception we give it a <em>several</em> Name; it followeth that for one and the same Thing, we have many Names or Attributes; as to the same Man we give the Appellations of <em>Just, Valiant,</em> &amp;c. for divers <em>Vertues</em>; of <em>Strong, Comely,</em> &amp;c. for divers <em>Qualities</em> of the <em>Body.</em> And again, because from divers Things we receive like Conceptions, many Things must needs have the same Appellation: as to all Things we <em>see,</em> we give the same Name of <em>Visible</em>; and to all Things we <em>see moveable,</em> we give the Appellation of <em>Moveable</em>: and those Names we give to <em>many,</em> are called <em>universal</em> to them all; as the Name of Man to every particular of Mankind: such Appellation as we give to <em>one</em> only Thing, we call <em>individual,</em> or singular; as <em>Socrates,</em> and other proper Names: or, by Circumlocution, he that writ the <em>Iliads,</em> for <em>Homer.</em>","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Universality of <em>one Name</em> to many Things, hath been the Cause that Men think the <em>Things</em> are themselves universal; and so seriously contend, that besides <em>Peter</em> and <em>John,</em> and all the rest of the Men that are, have been, or shall be in the World, there is yet something else that we call <em>Man,</em> viz. <em>Man in general,</em> deceiving themselves, by taking the universal, or general Appellation, for the thing it signifieth: For if one should desire the Painter to make him the Picture of a Man, which is as much as to say, of a Man in general; he meaneth no more, but that the Painter should chuse what Man he pleaseth to draw, which must needs be some of them that are, or have been, or may be, none of which are <em>universal.</em> But when he would have him to draw the Picture of the King, or any particular Person, he limiteth the Painter to that one Person he chuseth. It is plain therefore, that there is <em>nothing universal</em> but <em>Names</em>; which are therefore called <em>indefinite</em>; because we limit them not our selves, but leave them to be applied by the Hearer: whereas a singular Name is limited and restrained to one of the many Things it signifieth; as when we say, This Man, pointing to him, or giving him his proper Name, or by some such other Way.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Appellations that be <em>universal,</em> and common to many Things, are <em>not</em> always given to all the <em>particulars,</em> (as they ought to be) for like Conceptions, and like Considerations in them all; which is the Cause that many of them are <em>not</em> of <em>constant</em> Signification, but bring into our Mind other Thoughts than these for which they were ordained, and those are called <em>aequivocal.</em> As for Example, the Word Faith signifieth the same with Belief; sometimes it signifieth particularly that Belief which maketh a Christian; and sometime it signifieth the keeping of a Promise. Also all <em>Metaphors</em> are by Profession <em>aequivocal:</em> and there is scarce any Word that is not made <em>aequivocal</em> by divers Contextures of Speech, or by Diversity of Pronunciation and Gesture.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This <em>Æquivocation</em> of Names maketh it <em>difficult</em> to recover those Conceptions for which the Name was ordained; and that not only in the Language of other Men, wherein we are to consider the <em>Drift</em> and <em>Occasion,</em> and <em>Contexture</em> of the Speech, as well as the <em>Words</em> themselves; but also in our Discourse, which being derived from the Custom and common Use of Speech, representeth unto us not our own Conceptions.

The <em>Passions</em> of Man, as they are the Beginning of <em>voluntary</em> Motions; so are they the Beginning of <em>Speech,</em> which is the Motion of the Tongue. And Men desiring to shew others the Knowledge, Opinions, Conceptions and Passions which are in themselves, and to that End having invented <em>Language,</em> have by that Means transferred all that <em>Discursion</em> of their <em>Mind</em> mentioned in the former Chapter, by the <em>Motion</em> of their <em>Tongues,</em> into <em>Discourse</em> of <em>Words</em>: And <em>Ratio</em> now is but <em>Oratio,</em> for the most part, wherein Custom hath so great a Power, that the Mind suggesteth only the first Word; the rest follow <em>habitually,</em> and are not followed by the Mind; as it is with Beggars, when they saw their <em>Pater noster,</em> putting together such Words, and in such manner, as in their Education they have learned from their Nurses, from their Companies, or from their Teachers, having <em>no Images</em> or <em>Conceptions</em> in their Mind, answering to the Words they speak: and as they have learned themselves, so they teach Posterity. Now if we consider the Power of those <em>Deceptions</em> of the Sense, mentioned Chap 2. Sect. 10 and also how <em>unconstantly</em> Names have been setled, and how subject they are to <em>Æquivocation,</em> and how <em>diversified</em> by <em>Passion,</em> (scarce two Men agreeing what is to be called Good, and what Evil; what Liberality, what Prodigality; what Valour, what Temerity) and how subject Men are to Paralogism or Fallacy in Reasoning, I may in a Manner conclude, that it is impossible to <em>rectifie</em> so many Errours of any one Man, as must needs proceed from those Causes, without beginning <em>a-new</em> from the very first Grounds of all our Knowledge and Sense; and instead of Books, reading over orderly ones own Conceptions: In which Meaning, I take <em>Noste teipsum</em> for a Precept worthy the Reputation it hath gotten.","subId":"14","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.14"}]}
