The Experience we have hereof, is in such Brute Beasts, which, having the providence to hide the Remains and Superfluity of their Meat, do nevertheless want the Remembrance of the Place where they hide it, and thereby make no Benefit thereof in their Hunger: but Man, who in this Point beginneth to rank himself somewhat above the Nature of Beasts, hath observed and remembred the Cause of this Defect, and to amend the same, hath imagined or devised to set up a visible or other sensible Mark, the which, when he seeth it again, may bring to his Mind the Thought he had when he set it up. A <em>Mark</em> therefore is a <em>sensible Object</em> which a Man erecteth voluntarily to himself, to the End to <em>remember</em> thereby somewhat past, when the same is objected to his Sense again: As men that have past by a Rock at Sea, set up some Mark, thereby to remember their former Danger, and avoid it.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the Number of these <em>Marks,</em> are those <em>Humane Voices,</em> which we call the <em>Names</em> or Appellations of Things sensible by the Ear, by which we recall into our Mind some Conceptions of the Things to which we gave those Names or Appellations; as the Appellation <em>White</em> bringeth to remembrance the Quality of such Objects as produce that Colour or Conception in us.

It is plain therefore, that there is <em>nothing universal</em> but <em>Names</em>; which are therefore called <em>indefinite</em>; because we limit them not our selves, but leave them to be applied by the Hearer: whereas a singular Name is limited and restrained to one of the many Things it signifieth; as when we say, This Man, pointing to him, or giving him his proper Name, or by some such other Way.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Appellations that be <em>universal,</em> and common to many Things, are <em>not</em> always given to all the <em>particulars,</em> (as they ought to be) for like Conceptions, and like Considerations in them all; which is the Cause that many of them are <em>not</em> of <em>constant</em> Signification, but bring into our Mind other Thoughts than these for which they were ordained, and those are called <em>aequivocal.</em> As for Example, the Word Faith signifieth the same with Belief; sometimes it signifieth particularly that Belief which maketh a Christian; and sometime it signifieth the keeping of a Promise. Also all <em>Metaphors</em> are by Profession <em>aequivocal:</em> and there is scarce any Word that is not made <em>aequivocal</em> by divers Contextures of Speech, or by Diversity of Pronunciation and Gesture.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.5.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This <em>Æquivocation</em> of Names maketh it <em>difficult</em> to recover those Conceptions for which the Name was ordained; and that not only in the Language of other Men, wherein we are to consider the <em>Drift</em> and <em>Occasion,</em> and <em>Contexture</em> of the Speech, as well as the <em>Words</em> themselves; but also in our Discourse, which being derived from the Custom and common Use of Speech, representeth unto us not our own Conceptions.

The <em>Passions</em> of Man, as they are the Beginning of <em>voluntary</em> Motions; so are they the Beginning of <em>Speech,</em> which is the Motion of the Tongue.
