As for that Difference which ariseth from <em>Sickness,</em> and such accidental Distempers, I omit the same, as impertinent to this Place, and consider, it only in such as have their <em>Health,</em> and <em>Organs</em> well disposed. If the Difference were in the natural Temper of the Brain, I can imagin no Reason why the same should not appear first and most of all in the Senses, which being equal both in the wise and less wise, infer an equal Temper in the common Organ (namely the Brain) of all the Senses.","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But we see by Experience, that <em>Joy</em> and <em>Grief</em> proceed <em>not</em> in <em>all</em> Men from the <em>same Causes,</em> and that men differ very much in the Constitution of the Body; whereby, that which helpeth and furthereth <em>vital Constitution</em> in one, and is therefore delightful, hindereth it and crosseth it in another, and therefore causeth Grief. The <em>Difference</em> therefore of <em>Wits</em> hath its Original <em>from</em> the <em>different Passions,</em> and from the <em>Ends</em> to which the Appetite leadeth them.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And first, those Men whose Ends are <em>sensual</em> Delight, and generally are addicted to <em>Ease, Food, Onerations</em> and <em>Exonerations</em> of the Body, must needs be the <em>less</em> thereby delighted with those <em>Imaginations</em> that <em>conduce not</em> to those Ends, such as are Imaginations of <em>Honour</em> and <em>Glory,</em> which, as I have said before, have Respect to the future: For Sensuality consisteth in the Pleasure of the Senses, which please only for the present, and take away the Inclination to observe such Things as conduce to Honour, and consequently maketh Men less curious, and less ambitious, whereby they less consider the Way either to Knowledge or other Power: in which two consisteth all the Excellency of Power cognitive. And this is it which Men call <em>Dulness,</em> and proceedeth from the Appetite of sensual or bodily Delight. And it may well be conjectured, that such Passion hath its Beginning from a <em>Grossness</em> and <em>Difficulty</em> of the <em>Motion</em> of the <em>Spirit</em> about the <em>Heart.</em>","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Contrary hereunto, is that <em>quick Rangeing</em> of Mind described, Chap. 4. Sect. 3. which is joyned with <em>Curiosity</em> of comparing the Things that come into the Mind, one with another: in which Comparison, a Man delighteth himself either with finding unexpected <em>Similitude</em> of Things, otherwise much unlike, in which Men place the Excellency of <em>Fancy,</em> and from whence proceed those grateful Similies, Metaphors, and other Tropes, by which both <em>Poets</em> and <em>Orators</em> have it in their Power to make Things please or displease, and shew well or ill to others, as they like themselves; or else in discerning suddenly <em>Dissimilitude</em> in Things that otherwise appear the same. And this Vertue of the Mind is that by which Men attain to exact and perfect <em>Knowledge</em>; and the Pleasure thereof consisteth in continual Instruction, and in Distinction of Places, Persons, and Seasons, and is commonly termed by the Name of <em>Judgement</em>: for, to judge is nothing else, but to distinguish or discern: And both <em>Fancy</em> and <em>Judgement</em> are commonly comprehended under the Name of <em>Wit,</em> which seemeth to be a Tenuity and Agility of Spirits, contrary to that Restiness of the Spirits supposed in those that are dull.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is another Defect of the Mind, which Men call <em>Levity,</em> which betrayeth also <em>Mobility</em> in the Spirits, but in Excess. An Example whereof is in them that in the midst of any serious Discourse, have their Minds diverted to every little Jest or witty Observation; which maketh them depart from their Discourse by a Parenthesis, and from that Parenthesis by another, till at length they either lose themselves, or make their Narration like a Dream, or some studied Nonsence. The Passion from whence this proceedeth, is <em>Curiosity,</em> but with <em>too much Equality</em> and Indifference: for when all Things make equal Impression and Delight, they equally throng to be expressed.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Vertue opposite to this Defect, is <em>Gravity,</em> or Steadiness; in which the End being the great and Master-Delight, directeth and keepeth in the Way thereto all other Thoughts.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <em>Extremity</em> of Dulness is that <em>natural Folly</em> which may be called <em>Stolidity</em>: But the Extream of <em>Levity,</em> though it be natural Folly distinct from the other, and obvious to every Mans Observation, I know <em>not</em> how to call it.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is a Fault of the Mind called by the Greeks <span class=\"foreign\"><cite>Greek text</cite></span>, which is <em>Indocibility,</em> or <em>Difficulty</em> of being taught; the which must needs arise from a <em>false Opinion</em> that they <em>know already</em> the Truth of that is called in question: for certainly Men are not otherwise so unequal in capacity as the <em>Evidence</em> is unequal between what is taught by the Mathematicians, and what is commonly discoursed of in other Books: and therefore if the Minds of Men were all of white Paper, they would all most equally be disposed to acknowledge whatsoever should be in right Method, and by right Ratiocination delivered to them: But when Men have once acquiesced in untrue Opinions, and registred them as Authentical Records in their Minds, it is no less impossible to speak intelligibly to such Men, than to write legibly upon a Paper already scribled over. The immediate <em>Cause</em> therefore of <em>Indocibility,</em> is <em>Prejudice</em>; and of prejudice, false Opinion of our own Knowledge.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Another, and a principal Defect of the Mind, is that which Men call <em>Madness,</em> which appeareth to be nothing else but some <em>Imagination</em> of some such <em>Predominancy</em> above the <em>rest,</em> that we have <em>no Passion but from it</em>; and this Conception is nothing else but excessive <em>vain Glory,</em> or <em>vain Dejection</em>: which is most propable by these Examples following, which proceed in Appearance every one of them from <em>Pride,</em> or some <em>Dejection</em> of Mind. As first, we have had the Example of one that preached in <em>Cheapside</em> from a Cart there, instead of a Pulpit, that he himself was Christ, which was <em>spiritual</em> Pride or Madness. We have had also divers Examples of Learned Madness, in which Men have manifestly been distracted upon any Occasion that hath put them in Remembrance of their own Ability. Amongst the learned Men, may be remembred (I think also) those that determine of the Time of the Worlds End, and other such the Points of Prophecy. And the gallant Madness of <em>Don Quixotte</em> is nothing else but an Expression of such Height of vain Glory as reading of <em>Romance</em> may produce in pusillanimous Men. Also Rage and Madness of Love, are but great Indignations of them in whose Brains is predominant Contempt from their Enemies, or their Mistresses. And the <em>Pride</em> taken in <em>Form</em> and <em>Behaviour,</em> hath made divers Men run mad, and to be so accounted, under the Name of Fantastick.","subId":"9","id":"Hobbes.HN.10.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And as these are the Examples of Extremities, so also are there Examples too many of the Degrees, which may therefore be well accounted Follies; as it is a Degree of the <em>first,</em> for a Man, without certain Evidence, to think himself to be <em>inspired,</em> or to have any other Effect of Gods holy Spirit than other godly Men have. Of the <em>second,</em> for a Man continually to speak his mind in a <em>Cento</em> of other Mens Greek or Latine Sentences. Of the <em>third,</em> much of the present Gallantry in Love and Duel.
