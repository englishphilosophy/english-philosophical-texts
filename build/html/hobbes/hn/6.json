Who, by answering, It was Green, discovered himself, and was punished for a Counterfeit: for though by his Sight newly received he might distinguish between Green, and Red, and all other Colours, as well as any that should interrogate him, yet he could not possibly know at first Sight which of them was called Green, or Red, or by any other Name. By this we may understand, there be <em>two Kinds</em> of Knowledge, whereof the <em>one</em> is nothing else but <em>Sense,</em> or Knowledge <em>original,</em> as I have said in the Beginning of the second Chapter, and <em>Remembrance</em> of the same; the <em>other</em> is called <em>Science</em> or Knowledge of the <em>Truth of Propositions,</em> and how Things are called; and is derived from <em>Understanding.</em> Both of these Sorts are but <em>Experience</em>; The former being the Experience of the Effects of Things that work upon us from <em>without</em>; and the latter Experience Men have from the proper Use of <em>Names</em> in Language: and all Experience being, as I have said, but Remembrance, all Knowledge is Remembrance: and of the <em>former,</em> the Register we keep in Books, is called <em>History</em>; But the Registers of the <em>latter</em> are called the <em>Sciences.</em>","subId":"1","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are <em>two Things</em> necessarily implied in this Word <em>Knowledge</em>; the one is <em>Truth,</em> the other <em>Evidence</em>: for what is not Truth, can never be known. For, let a Man say he knoweth a Thing never so well, if the same shall afterwards appear false, he is driven to Confession, that it was not Knowledge, but Opinion. Likewise, if the Truth be not evident, though a Man holdeth it, yet is his Knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold the contrary: for if Truth were enough to make it Knowledge, all Truth were known; which is not so.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What <em>Truth</em> is, hath been defined in the <em>precedent</em> Chapter; What <em>Evidence</em> is, I <em>now</em> set down: and it is the Concomitance of a Mans <em>Conception</em> with the <em>Words</em> that signifie such Conception in the Act of Ratiocination: for when a Man reasoneth with his Lips only, to which the Mind suggesteth only the Beginning, and followeth not the Words of his Mouth with the Conceptions of his Mind, out of Custom of so speaking; though he begin his Ratiocination with True Propositions, and proceed with certain Syllogisms, and thereby make always true Conclusions; yet are not his Conclusions <em>evident</em> to him, for Want of the <em>Concomitance</em> of <em>Conception</em> with his Words: for if the Words alone were sufficient, a <em>Parrot</em> might be taught as well to know Truth, as to speak it. Evidence is to Truth, as the Sap to the Tree, which, so far as it creepeth along with Body and Branches, keepeth them alive; where it forsaketh them, they die: for this Evidence, which is Meaning with our Words, is the Life of Truth.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Knowledge therefore which we call <em>Science,</em> I define to be <em>Evidence of Truth,</em> from some Beginning or Principle of <em>Sense</em>: for the Truth of a Proposition is never evident, until we conceive the Meaning of the Words or Terms whereof it consisteth, which are always Conceptions of the Mind: Nor can we remember those Conceptions, without the Thing that produced the same by our Senses. The <em>first</em> Principle of Knowledge is, that we have such and such <em>Conceptions</em>; the <em>second,</em> that we have thus and thus <em>named</em> the Things whereof they are Conceptions; the <em>third</em> is, that we have <em>joyned</em> those <em>Names</em> in such Manner as to make true Propositions; the <em>fourth</em> and last is, that we have <em>joyned</em> those <em>Propositions</em> in such Manner as they be concluding, and the Truth of the Conclusion said to be known. And of these two Kinds of Knowledge, whereof the former is <em>Experience of Fact,</em> and the later of <em>Evidence of Truth</em>; as the <em>former,</em> if it be great, is called <em>Prudence</em>; so the <em>latter,</em> if it be much, hath usually been called, both by Ancient and Modern Writers, <em>Sapience</em> or Wisdom: and of this <em>latter, Man</em> only is capable; of the <em>former, brute Beasts</em> also participate.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Proposition is said to be <em>supposed,</em> when, being <em>not evident,</em> it is nevertheless <em>admitted for a Time,</em> to the End, that, joyning to it other Propositions, we may <em>conclude</em> something; and to <em>proceed</em> from Conclusion to Conclusion, for a <em>Trial</em> whether the same will lead us into any <em>absurd</em> or impossible Conclusion; which if it <em>do,</em> then we know such Supposition to have been false.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But if, running thorow <em>many</em> Conclusions, we come to <em>none</em> that are <em>absurd,</em> then we think the Proposition <em>probable</em>: likewise we think probable whatsoever Proposition we <em>admit</em> for Truth by Errour of Reasoning, or from trusting to other Men: And all such Propositions as are admitted by <em>Trust</em> or errour, we are not said to <em>know,</em> but <em>think</em> them to be true; and the Admittance of them is called <em>Opinion.</em>","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And particularly, when the Opinion is admitted out of <em>Trust</em> to <em>other</em> Men, they are said to <em>believe</em> it; and their Admittance of it is called <em>Belief,</em> and sometimes <em>Faith.</em>","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is either <em>Science</em> or <em>Opinion</em> which we commonly mean by the Word <em>Conscience</em>: for Men say that such and such a thing is true in or upon their Conscience; which they <em>never</em> do, when they think it <em>doubtful</em>; and therefore they <em>know,</em> or <em>think</em> they know it to be true. But Men, when they say Things upon their Conscience, are not therefore presumed certainly to know the Truth of what they say: It remaineth then, that that Word is used by them that have an <em>Opinion, not</em> only of the <em>Truth</em> of the Thing, <em>but</em> also of their <em>Knowledge</em> of it, to which the <em>Truth</em> of the Proposition is consequent. <em>Conscience</em> I therefore define to be <em>Opinion of Evidence.</em>","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.6.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<em>Belief,</em> which is the admitting of Propositions upon <em>Trust,</em> in many Cases is no less free from <em>Doubt,</em> than perfect and manifest <em>Knowledge</em>: for as there is nothing whereof there is not some Cause; so, when there is Doubt, there must be some Cause thereof conceived Now there be many Things which we receive from <em>Report of others,</em> of which it is impossible to imagine any Cause of <em>Doubt</em>: for what can be opposed against the Consent of all Men, in Things they can know, and have no Cause to report otherwise than they are, (such as is great Part of our <em>Histories</em>) unless a Man would say that all the World had <em>conspired</em> to deceive him.
