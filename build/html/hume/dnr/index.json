Because of the sensitive nature of the text, however, he did not publish it in his lifetime, but left instructions to his nephew to publish it after his death. It was printed in 1779, and this edition is naturally our copytext. Fortunately, however, Humeâ€™s own manuscript for the work survives. This manuscript was consulted in drawing up the critical text provided here.","texts":[{"id":"Hume.DNR.Intro","imported":true,"title":"Pamphilus to Hermippus","breadcrumb":"Pamphilus to Hermippus","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.1","imported":true,"title":"Part 1","breadcrumb":"Part 1","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.2","imported":true,"title":"Part 2","breadcrumb":"Part 2","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.3","imported":true,"title":"Part 3","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.4","imported":true,"title":"Part 4","breadcrumb":"Part 4","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.5","imported":true,"title":"Part 5","breadcrumb":"Part 5","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.6","imported":true,"title":"Part 6","breadcrumb":"Part 6","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.7","imported":true,"title":"Part 7","breadcrumb":"Part 7","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.8","imported":true,"title":"Part 8","breadcrumb":"Part 8","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.9","imported":true,"title":"Part 9","breadcrumb":"Part 9","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.10","imported":true,"title":"Part 10","breadcrumb":"Part 10","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.11","imported":true,"title":"Part 11","breadcrumb":"Part 11","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.12","imported":true,"title":"Part 12","breadcrumb":"Part 12","published":[1779]}],"forename":"David","surname":"Hume","author":"David Hume","birth":1711,"death":1776,"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"<h2>DIALOGUES</h2> <h4>CONCERNING</h4> <h1>NATURAL RELIGION.</h1> ","id":"Hume.DNR"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hume","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":1739,"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hume.THN","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Treatise of Human Nature","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1739,1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.A","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"An Abstract of a Book Lately Published","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.EWU","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1741,1742,1756],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.LG","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1745],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.ETSS","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1758],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.HE","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"The History of England","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1754,1757,1759,1762],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true},{"id":"Hume.DNR","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1779],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true}]}],"prev":{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true}}
