There will be a distinction of rank between the nobility and people, but this will be the only distinction in the state.

When a monarch extends his dominions by conquest, he soon learns to consider his old and his new subjects as on the same footing; because, in reality, all his subjects are to him the same, except the few friends and favourites, with whom he is personally acquainted. He does not, therefore, make any distinction between them in his <em>general</em> laws; and, at the same time, is careful to prevent all <em>particular</em> acts of oppression on the one as well as on the other. But a free state necessarily makes a great distinction, and must always do so, till men learn to love their neighbours as well as themselves. The conquerors, in such a government, are all legislators, and will be sure to contrive matters, by restrictions on trade, and by taxes, so as to draw some private, as well as public, advantage from their conquests. Provincial governors have also a better chance, in a republic, to escape with their plunder, by means of bribery or intrigue; and their fellow-citizens, who find their own state to be enriched by the spoils of the subject provinces, will be the more inclined to tolerate such abuses. Not to mention, that it is a necessary precaution in a free state to change the governors frequently; which obliges these temporary tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious, that they may accumulate sufficient wealth before they give place to their successors. What cruel tyrants were the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Romans</span> over the world during the time of their commonwealth! It is true, they had laws to prevent oppression in their provincial magistrates; but <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cicero</span> informs us, that the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Romans</span> could not better consult the interests of the provinces than by repealing these very laws. For, in that case, says he, our magistrates, having entire impunity, would plunder no more than would satisfy their own rapaciousness; whereas, at present, they must also satisfy that of their judges, and of all the great men in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span>, of whose protection they stand in need. Who can read of the cruelties and oppressions of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Verres</span> without horror and astonishment? <span class=\"page-break\"></span>And who is not touched with indignation to hear, that, after <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cicero</span> had exhausted on that abandoned criminal all the thunders of his eloquence, and had prevailed so far as to get him condemned to the utmost extent of the laws; yet that cruel tyrant lived peaceably to old age, in opulence and ease, and, thirty years afterwards, was put into the proscription by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mark Anthony</span>, on account of his exorbitant wealth, where he fell with <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cicero</span> himself, and all the most virtuous men of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span>? After the dissolution of the commonwealth, the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Roman</span> yoke became easier upon the provinces, as <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tacitus</span> informs us<a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; and it may be observed, that many of the worst emperors, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Domitian</span><a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, for instance, were careful to prevent all oppression on the provinces. In<a href=\"#n4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tiberius</span>'s time, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Gaul</span> was esteemed richer than <span class=\"small-capitals\">Italy</span> itself: Nor, do I find, during the whole time of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Roman</span> monarchy, that the empire became less rich or populous in any of its provinces; though indeed its valour and military discipline were always upon the <span class=\"page-break\"></span>decline. The oppression and tyranny of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Carthaginians</span> over their subject states in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Africa</span> went so far, as we learn from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Polybius</span><a href=\"#n5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, that, not content with exacting the half of all the produce of the land, which of itself was a very high rent, they also loaded them with many other taxes. If we pass from ancient to modern times, we shall still find the observation to hold. The provinces of absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of free states. Compare the <em>Païs conquis</em> of <span class=\"small-capitals\">France</span> with <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ireland</span>, and you will be convinced of this truth; though this latter kingdom, being, in a good measure, peopled from <span class=\"small-capitals\">England</span>, possesses so many rights and privileges as should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a conquered province. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Corsica</span> is also an obvious instance to the same purpose.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.PR.9","pages":"18-21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is an observation in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Machiavel</span>, with regard to the conquests of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexander</span> the Great, which I think, may be regarded as one of those eternal political truths, which no time nor accidents can vary. It may seem strange, says that politician, that such sudden conquests, as those of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexander</span>, should be possessed so peaceably by his successors, and that the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persians</span>, during all the confusions and civil wars among the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greeks</span>, never made the smallest effort towards the recovery of their former independent government. To satisfy us concerning the cause of this remarkable event, we may <span class=\"page-break\"></span>consider, that a monarch may govern his subjects in two different ways. He may either follow the maxims of the eastern princes, and stretch his authority so far as to leave no distinction of rank among his subjects, but what proceeds immediately from himself; no advantages of birth; no hereditary honours and possessions; and, in a word, no credit among the people, except from his commission alone. Or a monarch may exert his power after a milder manner, like other <span class=\"small-capitals\">European</span> princes; and leave other sources of honour, beside his smile and favour: Birth, titles, possessions, valour, integrity, knowledge, or great and fortunate atchievements. In the former species of government, after a conquest, it is impossible ever to shake off the yoke; since no one possesses, among the people, so much personal credit and authority as to begin such an enterprize: Whereas, in the latter, the least misfortune, or discord among the victors, will encourage the vanquished to take arms, who have leaders ready to prompt and conduct them in every undertaking<a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.PR.10","pages":"21-2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Such is the reasoning of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Machiavel</span>, which seems solid and conclusive; though I wish he had not mixed falsehood with truth, in asserting, that monarchies, governed according to eastern policy, though more easily kept when once subdued, yet are the most difficult to subdue; since they cannot contain any powerful subject, whose discontent and faction may facilitate the enterprizes of an enemy. For besides, that such a tyrannical government enervates the courage of men, and renders them indifferent towards the fortunes of their sovereign; besides this, I say, we find by experience, that even the temporary and delegated authority of the generals and <span class=\"page-break\"></span>magistrates; being always, in such governments, as absolute within its sphere, as that of the prince himself; is able, with barbarians, accustomed to a blind submission, to produce the most dangerous and fatal revolutions.

His grandson, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Megabyzus</span>, commanded the army, defeated at <span class=\"small-capitals\">Marathon</span>. His great-grandson, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Zopyrus</span>, was also eminent, and was banished <ins>from</ins> <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persia</span>. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Herod.</span> lib. iii. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Thuc.</span> lib. i. <span class=\"page-break\"></span><span class=\"small-capitals\">Rosaces</span>, who commanded an army in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Egypt</span> under <span class=\"small-capitals\">Artaxerxes</span>, was also descended from one of the seven conspirators, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Diod. Sic.</span> lib. xvi. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Agesilaus</span>, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Xenophon</span>, Hist. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Græc.</span> lib. iv. being desirous of making a marriage betwixt king <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cotys</span> his ally, and the daughter of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spithridates</span>, a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persian</span> of rank, who had deserted to him, first asks <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cotys</span> what family <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spithridates</span> is of. One of the most considerable in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persia</span>, says <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cotys</span>. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ariæus</span>, when offered the sovereignty by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Clearchus</span> and the ten thousand <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greeks</span>, refused it as of too low a rank, and said, that so many eminent <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persians</span> would never endure his rule. <em>Id. de exped.</em> lib. ii. Some of the families descended from the seven <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persians</span> abovementioned remained during all <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexander</span>'s successors; and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mithirdates</span>, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Antiochus</span>'s time, is said by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Polybius</span> to be descended from one of them, lib. v. cap. 43. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Artabazus</span> was esteemed, as <span class=\"small-capitals\">Arrian</span> says, <span class=\"foreign\"><em>εν τοις πρωτοις Περσων</em></span> lib. iii. And when <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexander</span> married in one day 80 of his captains to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persian</span> women, his intention plainly was to ally the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Macedonians</span> with the most eminent <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persian</span> families. Id. lib. vii. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Diodorus Siculus</span> says they were of the most noble birth in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persia</span>, lib. xvii. The government of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persia</span> was despotic, and conducted in many respects, after the eastern manner, but was not carried so far as to extirpate all nobility, and confound all ranks and orders. It left men who were still great, by themselves and their family, independent of their office and commission. And the reason why the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Macedonians</span> kept so easily dominion over them was owing to other causes easy to be found in the historians; though it must be owned that <span class=\"small-capitals\">Machiavel</span>'s reasoning is, in itself, just, however doubtful its application to the present case.","subId":"n6.1","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.PR.n6.1","pages":"22-3"},{"type":"note","content":"<em>Essempio veramente raro, &amp; da Filosofi intante loro imaginate &amp; vedute Republiche mai non trovato, vedere dentro ad un medesimo cerchio, fra medesimi cittadini, la liberta, &amp; la tirannide, la vita civile &amp; la corotta, la giustitia &amp; la licenza; perche quello ordine solo mantiere quella citta piena di costumi antichi &amp; venerabili.
