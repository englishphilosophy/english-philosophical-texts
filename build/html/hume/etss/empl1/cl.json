I am apt, however, to entertain a suspicion, that the world is still too young to fix many general truths in politics, which will remain true to the latest posterity. We have not as yet had experience of three thousand years; so that not only the art of reasoning is still imperfect in this science, as in all others, but we even want sufficient materials upon which we can reason. It is not fully known, what degree of refinement, either in virtue or vice, human nature is susceptible of; nor what may be expected of mankind <span class=\"page-break\"></span>from any great revolution in their education, customs, or principles. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Machiavel</span> was certainly a great genius; but having confined his study to the furious and tyrannical governments of ancient times, or to the little disorderly principalities of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Italy</span>, his reasonings especially upon monarchical government, have been found extremely defective; and there scarcely is any maxim in his <em>prince</em>, which subsequent experience has not entirely refuted. <em>A weak prince</em>, says he, <em>is incapable of receiving good counsel; for if he consult with several, he will not be able to choose among their different counsels. If he abandon himself to one, that minister may, perhaps, have capacity; but he will not long be a minister: He will be sure to dispossess his master, and place himself and his family upon the throne.</em> I mention this, among many instances of the errors of that politician, proceeding, in a great measure, from his having lived in too early an age of the world, to be a good judge of political truth.

Private property seems to me almost as secure in <span class=\"page-break\"></span>a civilized <span class=\"small-capitals\">European</span> monarchy, as in a republic; nor is danger much apprehended in such a government, from the violence of the sovereign; more than we commonly dread harm from thunder, or earthquakes, or any accident the most unusual and extraordinary. Avarice, the spur of industry, is so obstinate a passion, and works its way through so many real dangers and difficulties, that it is not likely to be scared by an imaginary danger, which is so small, that it scarcely admits of calculation. Commerce, therefore, in my opinion, is apt to decay in absolute governments, not because it is there less <em>secure</em>, but because it is less <em>honourable</em>. A subordination of ranks is absolutely necessary to the support of monarchy. Birth, titles, and place, must be honoured above industry and riches. And while these notions prevail, all the considerable traders will be tempted to throw up their commerce, in order to purchase some of those employments, to which privileges and honours are annexed.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.CL.10","pages":"92-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Since I am upon this head, of the alterations which time has produced, or may produce in politics, I must observe, that all kinds of government, free and absolute, seem to have undergone, in modern times, a great change for the better, with regard both to foreign and domestic management.

It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies, what was formerly said in praise of republics alone, <em>that they are a government of Laws, not of Men</em>. They are found susceptible of order, method, and constancy, to a surprizing degree. Property is there secure; industry encouraged; the arts flourish; and the prince lives secure among his subjects, like a father among his children. There are perhaps, and have been for two centuries, near two hundred absolute princes, great and small, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europe</span>; and allowing twenty years to each reign, we may suppose, that there have been in the whole two thousand monarchs or tyrants, as the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greeks</span> would have called them: Yet of these there has not been one, not even <span class=\"small-capitals\">Philip II.</span> of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spain</span>, so bad as <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tiberius</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Caligula</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Nero</span>, or <span class=\"small-capitals\">Domittan</span>, who were four in twelve amongst the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Roman</span> emperors.

The greatest abuses, which arise in <span class=\"small-capitals\">France</span>, the most perfect model of pure monarchy, proceed not from the number or weight of the taxes, beyond what are to be met with in free countries; but from the expensive, unequal, arbitrary, and intricate method of levying them, by which the industry of the poor, especially of the peasants and farmers, is, in a great measure, discouraged, and agriculture rendered a beggarly and slavish employment. But to whose advantage do these abuses tend? If to that of the nobility, they might be esteemed inherent in that form of government; since the nobility are the true supports of monarchy; and it is natural their interest should be more consulted, in such a constitution, than that of the people. But the nobility are, in reality, the chief losers by this oppression; since it ruins their estates, and beggars their tenants. The only gainers by it are the <em>Finançiers</em>, a race of men rather odious to the nobility and the whole kingdom. If a prince or minister, therefore, should arise, endowed with sufficient discernment to know his own and the public interest, and with sufficient force of mind to break through ancient customs, we might expect to see these abuses remedied; in which case, the difference between that absolute government and our free one, would not appear so considerable as at present.","subId":"13","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL1.CL.13","pages":"94-5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The source of degeneracy, which may be remarked in free governments, consists in the practice of contracting debt, and mortgaging the public revenues, by which taxes may, in time, become altogether intolerable, and all the property of the state be brought into the hands of the public. This practice is of modern date. The <span class=\"small-capitals\">Athenians</span>, though governed by a republic, paid near two hundred <em>per Cent.</em> for those sums of money, which any emergence made it necessary for them to borrow; as we learn from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Xenophon</span><a href=\"#n5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Among the moderns, the <span class=\"page-break\"></span><span class=\"small-capitals\">Dutch</span> first introduced the practice of borrowing great sums at low interest, and have well nigh ruined themselves by it. Absolute princes have also contracted debt; but as an absolute prince may make a bankruptcy when he pleases, his people can never be oppressed by his debts. In popular governments, the people, and chiefly those who have the highest offices, being commonly the public creditors, it is difficult for the state to make use of this remedy, which, however it may sometimes be necessary, is always cruel and barbarous. This, therefore<ins>,</ins> seems to be an inconvenience, which nearly threatens all free governments; especially our own, at the present juncture of affairs.
