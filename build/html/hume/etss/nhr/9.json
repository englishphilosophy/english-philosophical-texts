At the same time, idolatry is attended with this evident advantage, that, by limiting the powers and functions of its deities, it naturally admits the gods of other sects and nations to a share of divinity, and renders all the various deities, as well as rites, ceremonies, or traditions, compatible with each other<a href=\"#n42\"><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Theism is opposite both in its advantages and disadvantages. As that system supposes one sole deity, the perfection of reason and goodness, it should, if justly prosecuted, banish every thing frivolous, unreasonable, or inhuman from religious worship, and set before men the most illustrious example, as well as the most commanding motives, of justice and benevolence. These mighty advantages are not indeed over-balanced (for that is not possible), but somewhat diminished, by inconveniencies, which arise from the vices and prejudices of mankind. While one sole object of devotion is acknowledged, the worship of other deities is regarded as absurd and impious. Nay, this unity of object seems naturally to require the unity of faith and ceremonies, and furnishes designing men with a pretence for representing their adversaries as profane, and the objects of divine as well as human vengeance. For as each sect is positive that its own faith and worship are entirely acceptable to the deity, and as no one can conceive, that the same being should be pleased with different and opposite rites and principles; the several sects fall naturally <span class=\"page-break\"></span>into animosity, and mutually discharge on each other that sacred zeal and rancour, the most furious and implacable of all human passions.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.9.1","pages":"60-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The tolerating spirit of idolaters, both in ancient and modern times, is very obvious to any one, who is the least conversant in the writings of historians or travellers. When the oracle of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Delphi</span> was asked, what rites or worship was most acceptable to the gods? Those which are legally established in each city, replied the oracle<a href=\"#n43\"><sup>[43]</sup></a>. Even priests, in those ages, could, it seems, allow salvation to those of a different communion. The <span class=\"small-capitals\">Romans</span> commonly adopted the gods of the conquered people; and never disputed the attributes of those local and national deities, in whose territories they resided. The religious wars and persecutions of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Egyptian</span> idolaters are indeed an exception to this rule; but are accounted for by ancient authors from reasons singular and remarkable. Different species of animals were the deities of the different sects among the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Egyptians</span>; and the deities being in continual war, engaged their votaries in the same contention. The worshippers of dogs could not long remain in peace with the adorers of cats or wolves<a href=\"#n44\"><sup>[44]</sup></a>.
