But the vulgar polytheist, so far from admitting that idea, deifies every part of the universe, and conceives all the conspicuous productions of nature, to be themselves so many real divinities. The sun, moon, and stars, are all gods according to his system: Fountains are inhabited by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become sacred in his eyes, and strike him with a religious veneration. And thus, however strong men's propensity to believe invisible, intelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to rest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to reconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the invisible power with some visible object.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.5.2","pages":"49"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The distribution also of distinct provinces to the several deities is apt to cause some allegory, both physical and moral, to enter into the vulgar systems of polytheism. The god of war will naturally be represented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The god of poetry as elegant, polite, and amiable: The god of merchandise, especially in early times, as thievish and deceitful. The allegories, supposed in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Homer</span> and other mythologists, I allow, have often been so strained, that men of sense are apt entirely to reject them, and to consider them as the production merely of the fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But that allegory really has place in the heathen mythology is undeniable even on the least reflection. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cupid</span> the son of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Venus</span>; the Muses the daughters of Memory; <span class=\"small-capitals\">Prometheus</span>, the wise brother, and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Epimetheus</span> the foolish; <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hygieia</span> or the goddess of health descended from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Æsculapius</span> or the god of physic: Who sees not, in these, and in many other instances, the plain traces of allegory? When a god is supposed to preside over any passion, event, or system of actions, it is almost <span class=\"page-break\"></span>unavoidable to give him a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, suitable to his supposed powers and influence; and to carry on that similitude and comparison, which is naturally so agreeable to the mind of man.","subId":"3","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.5.3","pages":"49-50"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Allegories, indeed, entirely perfect, we ought not to expect as the productions of ignorance and superstition; there being no work of genius that requires a nicer hand, or has been more rarely executed with success.

Most of the divinities of the ancient world are supposed to have once been men, and to have been beholden for their <em>apotheosis</em> to the admiration and affection of the people.

The limited influence of these agents, and their great proximity to human weakness, introduce the various distribution and division of their authority; and thereby give rise to allegory. The same principles naturally deify mortals, superior in power, courage, or understanding, and produce hero-worship; together with fabulous history and mythological tradition, in all its wild and unaccountable forms. And as an invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined for vulgar apprehension, men naturally affix it to some sensible representation; such as either the more conspicuous parts of nature, or the statues, images, and pictures, which a more refined age forms of its divinities.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.5.9","pages":"51"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Almost all idolaters, of whatever age or country, concur in these general principles and conceptions; and even the particular characters and provinces, which they assign to their deities, are not extremely different<a href=\"#n36\"><sup>[36]</sup></a>.
