But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind, and to have been, many of them, advanced from that inferior rank, we are more at our ease in our addresses to them, and may even, without profaneness, aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them. Hence activity, spirit, courage, magnanimity, love of liberty, and all the virtues which aggrandize a people.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.NHR.10.2","pages":"63"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The heroes in paganism correspond exactly to the saints in popery and holy dervises in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mahometanism</span>.
