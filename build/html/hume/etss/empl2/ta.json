But there is a third consequence, which often follows upon taxes, namely, that the poor encrease their industry, perform more work, and live as well as before, without demanding more for their labour. Where taxes are moderate, are laid on gradually, and affect not the necessaries of life, this consequence naturally follows; and it is certain, that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people, and render them more opulent and laborious, than others, who enjoy the greatest advantages. For we may observe, as a parallel instance, that the most commercial nations have not always possessed the greatest extent of fertile land; but, on the contrary, that they have laboured under many natural disadvantages. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tyre</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Athens</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Carthage</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rhodes</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Genoa</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Venice</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Holland</span>, are strong examples to this purpose. And in all history, we find only three instances of large and fertile countries, which have possessed much <span class=\"page-break\"></span>trade; the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Netherlands</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">England</span>, and <span class=\"small-capitals\">France</span>. The two former seem to have been allured by the advantages of their maritime situation, and the necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports, in order to procure what their own climate refused them. And as to <span class=\"small-capitals\">France</span>, trade has come late into that kingdom, and seems to have been the effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and enterprizing people, who remarked the riches acquired by such of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigation and commerce.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.2","pages":"343-4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The places mentioned by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cicero</span><a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, as possessed of the greatest commerce in his time, are <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexandria</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Colchus</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tyre</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Sidon</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Andros</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cyprus</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pamphylia</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Lycia</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rhodes</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Chios</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Byzantium</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Lesbos</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Smyrna</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Miletum</span>, <span class=\"small-capitals\">Coos</span>.

Sir <span class=\"small-capitals\">William Temple</span><a href=\"#n2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, we may observe, ascribes the industry of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Dutch</span> entirely to necessity, proceeding from their natural disadvantages; and illustrates his doctrine by a striking comparison with <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ireland</span>; <q>where,</q> says he, <q>by the largeness and plenty of the soil, and scarcity of people, all things necessary to life are so cheap, that an industrious man, by two days labour, may gain enough to feed him the rest of the week. Which I take to be a very plain ground of the laziness attributed to the people. For men naturally prefer ease before labour, and will not take pains if they can live idle; though when, by necessity, they have been inured to it, they cannot leave it, being grown a custom necessary to their health, and to their very entertainment. Nor perhaps is the change harder, from constant ease to labour, than from constant labour to ease.</q> After which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as <span class=\"page-break\"></span>above, the places where trade has most flourished, in ancient and modern times; and which are commonly observed to be such narrow confined territories, as beget a necessity for industry.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.4","pages":"344-5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The best taxes are such as are levied upon consumptions, especially those of luxury; because such taxes are least felt by the people. They seem, in some measure, voluntary; since a man may chuse how far he will use the commodity which is taxed: They are paid gradually and insensibly: They naturally produce sobriety and frugality, if judiciously imposed: And being confounded with the natural price of the commodity, they are scarcely perceived by the consumers. Their only disadvantage is, that they are expensive in the levying.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.5","pages":"345"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Taxes upon possessions are levied without expence; but have every other disadvantage.

They are commonly converted, by their management, into punishments on industry; and also, by their unavoidable inequality, are more grievous, than by the real burden which <span class=\"page-break\"></span>they impose. It is surprising, therefore, to see them have place among any civilized people.","subId":"7","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.7","pages":"345-6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbitrary, which they commonly are, may be esteemed dangerous: Because it is so easy for the sovereign to add a little more, and a little more, to the sum demanded, that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppressive and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty upon commodities checks itself; and a prince will soon find, that an encrease of the impost is no encrease of his revenue. It is not easy, therefore, for a people to be altogether ruined by such taxes.","subId":"8","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.8","pages":"346"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Historians inform us, that one of the chief causes of the destruction of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Roman</span> state, was the alteration, which <span class=\"small-capitals\">Constantine</span> introduced into the finances, by substituting an universal poll-tax, in lieu of almost all the tithes, customs, and excises, which formerly composed the revenue of the <em>empire</em>. The people, in all the provinces, were so grinded and oppressed by the <em>publicans</em>, that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians; whose dominion, as they had fewer necessities and less art, was found preferable to the refined tyranny of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Romans</span>.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.9","pages":"346"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is an opinion, zealously promoted by some political writers, that, since all taxes, as they pretend, fall ultimately upon land, it were better to lay them originally there, and abolish every duty upon consumptions. But it is denied, that all taxes fall ultimately upon land. If a duty be laid upon any commodity, consumed by an artisan, he has two obvious expedients for paying it; he may retrench somewhat of his expence, or he may encrease his labour. Both these resources are more easy and natural, than that of heightening his wages. We see, <span class=\"page-break\"></span>that, in years of scarcity, the weaver either consumes less or labours more, or employs both these expedients of frugality and industry, by which he is enabled to reach the end of the year. It is but just, that he should subject himself to the same hardships, if they deserve the name, for the sake of the publick, which gives him protection. By what contrivance can he raise the price of his labour? The manufacturer who employs him, will not give him more: Neither can he, because the merchant, who exports the cloth, cannot raise its price, being limited by the price which it yields in foreign markets. Every man, to be sure, is desirous of pushing off from himself the burden of any tax, which is imposed, and of laying it upon others: But as every man has the same inclination, and is upon the defensive; no set of men can be supposed to prevail altogether in this contest. And why the landed gentleman should be the victim of the whole, and should not be able to defend himself, as well as others are, I cannot readily imagine. All tradesmen, indeed, would willingly prey upon him, and divide him among them, if they could: But this inclination they always have, though no taxes were levied; and the same methods, by which he guards against the imposition of tradesmen before taxes, will serve him afterwards, and make them share the burden with him. They must be very heavy taxes, indeed, and very injudiciously levied, which the artizan will not, of himself, be enabled to pay, by superior industry and frugality, without raising the price of his labour.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.10","pages":"346-7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I shall conclude this subject with observing, that we have, with regard to taxes, an instance of what frequently happens in political institutions, that the consequences of things are diametrically opposite to what we should expect on the first appearance. It is regarded as a fundamental maxim of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Turkish</span> government, that the <em>Grand Signior</em>, though absolute master of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no authority to impose a new tax; and every <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ottoman</span> prince, who has made such an attempt, either has been obliged to retract, or has found the fatal effects of his perseverance. One would imagine, that this prejudice or established opinion were <span class=\"page-break\"></span>the firmest barrier in the world against oppression; yet it is certain, that its effect is quite contrary. The emperor, having no regular method of encreasing his revenue, must allow all the bashaws and governors to oppress and abuse the subjects: And these he squeezes after their return from their government. Whereas, if he could impose a new tax, like our <span class=\"small-capitals\">European</span> princes, his interest would so far be united with that of his people, that he would immediately feel the bad effects of these disorderly levies of money, and would find, that a pound, raised by a general imposition, would have less pernicious effects, than a shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner.","subId":"11","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.Ta.11","pages":"347-8"},{"type":"note","content":"Epist. ad <span class=\"small-capitals\">Att.</span> lib. ix. ep.
