The one party, by tracing up government to the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Deity</span>, endeavour to render it so sacred and inviolate, that it must be little less than sacrilege, however tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade it, in the smallest article. The other party, by founding government altogether on the consent of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">People</span>, suppose that there is a kind of <em>original contract</em>, by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority, with which they have, for certain purposes, voluntarily entrusted him.

As it is impossible for the human race to subsist, at least in any comfortable or secure state, without the protection of government; this <span class=\"page-break\"></span>institution must certainly have been intended by that beneficent Being, who means the good of all his creatures: And as it has universally, in fact, taken place, in all countries, and all ages; we may conclude, with still greater certainty, that it was intended by that omniscient Being, who can never be deceived by any event or operation. But since he gave rise to it, not by any particular or miraculous interposition, but by his concealed and universal efficacy; a sovereign cannot, properly speaking, be called his vice-gerent, in any other sense than every power or force, being derived from him, may be said to act by his commission. Whatever actually happens is comprehended in the general plan or intention of providence; nor has the greatest and most lawful prince any more reason, upon that account, to plead a peculiar sacredness or inviolable authority, than an inferior magistrate, or even an usurper, or even a robber and a pyrate. The same divine superintendant, who, for wise purposes, invested a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Titus</span> or a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Trajan</span> with authority, did also, for purposes, no doubt, equally wise, though unknown, bestow power on a <span class=\"small-capitals\">Borgia</span> or an <span class=\"small-capitals\">Angria</span>. The same causes, which gave rise to the sovereign power in every state, established likewise every petty jurisdiction in it, and every limited authority.

The people, if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and desarts, are the source of all power and jurisdiction, and voluntarily, for the sake of peace and order, abandoned their native liberty, and received laws from their equal and companion. The conditions, upon which they were willing to submit, were either expressed, or were so clear and obvious, that it might well be esteemed superfluous to express them. If this, then, be meant by the <em>original contract</em>, it cannot be denied, that all government is, at first, founded on a contract, and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed chiefly by that principle. In vain, are we asked in what records this charter of our liberties is registered. It was not written on parchment, nor yet on leaves or barks of trees. It preceded the use of writing and all the other civilized arts of life. But we trace it plainly in the nature of man, and in the equality, or something approaching equality, which we find in all the individuals of that species. The force, which now prevails, and which is founded on fleets and armies, is plainly political, and derived from authority, the effect of established government. A man's natural force consists only in the vigour of his limbs, and the firmness of his courage; which could never subject multitudes to the command of one. Nothing but their own consent, and their sense of the advantages resulting from peace and order, could have had that influence.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.OC.4","pages":"467-8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Yet even this consent was long very imperfect, and could not be the basis of a regular administration.

No compact or agreement, it is evident, was expressly formed for general submission; an idea far beyond the comprehension of savages: Each exertion of <span class=\"page-break\"></span>authority in the chieftain must have been particular, and called forth by the present exigencies of the case: The sensible utility, resulting from his interposition, made these exertions become daily more frequent; and their frequency gradually produced an habitual, and, if you please to call it so, a voluntary, and therefore precarious, acquiescence in the people.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.OC.5","pages":"468-9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But philosophers, who have embraced a party (if that be not a contradiction in terms) are not contented with these concessions.

They affirm, that all men are still born equal, and owe allegiance to no prince or government, unless bound by the obligation and sanction of a <em>promise</em>. And as no man, without some equivalent, would forego the advantages of his native liberty, and subject himself to the will of another; this promise is always understood to be conditional, and imposes on him no obligation, unless he meet with justice and protection from his sovereign. These advantages the sovereign promises him in return; and if he fail in the execution, he has broken, on his part, the articles of engagement, and has thereby freed his subject from all obligations to allegiance. Such, according to these philosophers, is the foundation of authority in every government; and such the right of resistance, possessed by every subject.","subId":"6","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.OC.6","pages":"469"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But would these reasoners look abroad into the world, they <span class=\"page-break\"></span>would meet with nothing that, in the least, corresponds to their ideas, or can warrant so refined and philosophical a system.

We find also, every where, subjects, who acknowledge this right in their prince, and suppose themselves born under obligations of obedience to a certain sovereign, as much as under the ties of reverence and duty to certain parents. These connexions are always conceived to be equally independent of our consent, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persia</span> and <span class=\"small-capitals\">China</span>; in <span class=\"small-capitals\">France</span> and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spain</span>; and even in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Holland</span> and <span class=\"small-capitals\">England</span>, wherever the doctrines above-mentioned have not been carefully inculcated.

Or if curiosity ever move them; as soon as they learn, that they themselves and their ancestors have, for several ages, or from time immemorial, been subject to such a form of government or such a family; they immediately acquiesce, and acknowledge their obligation to allegiance. Were you to preach, in most parts of the world, that political connexions are founded altogether on voluntary consent or a mutual promise, the magistrate would soon imprison you, as seditious, for loosening the ties of obedience; if your friends did not before shut you up as delirious, for advancing such absurdities. It is strange, that an act of the mind, which every individual is supposed to have formed, and after he came to the use of reason too, otherwise it could have no authority; that this act, I say, should be so much unknown to all of them, that, over the face of the whole earth, there scarcely remain any traces or memory of it.","subId":"7","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.OC.7","pages":"469-70"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the contract, on which government is founded, is said to be the <em>original contract</em>; and consequently may be supposed too old to fall under the knowledge of the present generation.
