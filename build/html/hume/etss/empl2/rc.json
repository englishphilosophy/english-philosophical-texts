One would think it essential to every supreme council or assembly, which debates, that entire liberty of speech should be granted to every member, and that all motions or reason<span class=\"page-break\"></span>ings should be received, which can any wise tend to illustrate the point under deliberation. One would conclude, with still greater assurance, that, after a motion was made, which was voted and approved by that assembly in which the legislative power is lodged, the member who made the motion must for ever be exempted from future trial or enquiry. But no political maxim can, at first sight, appear more undisputable, than that he must, at least, be secured from all inferior jurisdiction; and that nothing less than the same supreme legislative assembly, in their subsequent meetings, could make him accountable for those motions and harangues, to which they had before given their approbation.

But the people, having numbers and force on their side, and being elated with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign wars, always prevailed when pushed to extremity, and first extorted from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes, and next the legislative power of the <em>comitia tributa.</em> It then behoved the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people. For beside the force which the latter were always possessed of, they had now got possession of legal authority, and could instantly break in pieces any order or institution which directly opposed them. By intrigue, by influence, by money, by combination, and by the respect paid to their character, the nobles might often prevail, and direct the whole machine of government: But had they openly set their <em>comitia centuriata</em> in opposition to the <em>tributa</em>, they had soon lost the advantage of that institution, together with their consuls, prætors, ediles, and all the magis<span class=\"page-break\"></span>trates elected by it. But the <em>comitia tributa</em>, not having the same reason for respecting the <em>centuriata</em>, frequently repealed laws favourable to the Aristocracy: They limited the authority of the nobles, protected the people from oppression, and controuled the actions of the senate and magistracy. The <em>centuriata</em> found it convenient always to submit; and though equal in authority, yet being inferior in power, durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature, either by repealing its laws, or establishing laws, which, it foresaw, would soon be repealed by it.","subId":"11","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.RC.11","pages":"372-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"No instance is found of any opposition or struggle between these <em>comitia;</em> except one slight attempt of this kind, mentioned by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Appian</span> in the third book of his civil wars. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Mark Anthony</span>, resolving to deprive <span class=\"small-capitals\">Decimus Brutus</span> of the government of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cisalpine Gaul</span>, railed in the <em>Forum</em>, and called one of the <em>comitia</em>, in order to prevent the meeting of the other, which had been ordered by the senate.

It is a maxim in politics, which we readily admit as undisputed and universal, that a power, however great, when granted by law to an eminent magistrate, is not so dangerous to liberty, as an authority, however inconsiderable, which he acquires from violence and usurpation. For, besides that the law always limits every power which it bestows, the very receiving it as a concession establishes the authority whence it is derived, and preserves the harmony of the constitution. By the same right that one prerogative is assumed without law, another may also be claimed, and another, with still greater facility; while the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the following, and give force to maintain them. Hence the heroism of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Hampden</span>'s conduct, who sustained the whole violence of royal prosecution, rather than pay a tax of twenty shillings, not imposed by parliament; hence the care of all <span class=\"small-capitals\">English</span> patriots to guard against the first encroachments of the crown; and hence alone the existence, at this day, of <span class=\"small-capitals\">English</span> liberty.","subId":"14","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.RC.14","pages":"373-4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is, however, one occasion, where the parliament has departed from this maxim; and that is, in the <em>pressing of seamen</em>.

While this power is exercised to no other end than to man the navy, men willingly submit to it, from a sense of its use and necessity; and the sailors, who are alone affected by it, find no body to support them, in claiming the rights and privileges, which the law grants, without distinction, to all <span class=\"small-capitals\">English</span> subjects.

On the other hand, were the parliament to grant such an authority, they would probably fall into one of these two inconveniencies: They would either bestow it under so many restrictions as would make it lose its effect, by cramping the authority of the crown; or they would render it so large and comprehensive, as might give occasion to great abuses, for which we could, in that case, have no remedy.
