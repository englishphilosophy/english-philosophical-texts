The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge, or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another. It must therefore, as well as each individual form which it contains, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age; and it is probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the <span class=\"page-break\"></span>human species should possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradual revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourished in one period, and have decayed in another: But we may observe, that, at the time when they rose to greatest perfection among one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and though they universally decayed in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again revived, and diffused themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the human species; and though it were allowed, that the universe, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature<a href=\"#n1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroyed every gener<span class=\"page-break\"></span>ation, should make a vast difference, it may be thought, in the numbers of the people; and when joined to venereal distempers, a new plague diffused every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant operation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that ancient times were more populous than the present, and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.PA.2","pages":"379-80"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But is it certain, that antiquity was so much more populous, as is pretended?

For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation, more active than is ever universally exerted, the restraints, which they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties in their situation, which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, would more than double every generation. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are nowise straitened or confined, as in long established governments? History tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not perceived; and the society had again acquired their former number. The lands which were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities raised, the riches acquired, enabled the people, who escaped, immediately to marry, and to rear families, <span class=\"page-break\"></span>which supplied the place of those who had perished<a href=\"#n3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one which produces corn only, and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage. In general, warm climates, as the necessities of the inhabitants are there fewer, and vegetation more powerful, are likely to be most populous: But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that, wherever there are most happiness and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.PA.4","pages":"381-2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The question, therefore, concerning the populousness of ancient and modern times, being allowed of great importance, it will be requisite, if we would bring it to some determination, to compare both the <em>domestic</em> and <em>political</em> situation of these two periods, in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes; which is the <em>first</em> view in which we proposed to consider them.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.PA.5","pages":"383"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The chief difference between the <em>domestic</em> œconomy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery, which prevailed among the former, and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greater part of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europe</span>. Some passionate admirers of the ancients, and zealous partizans of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they are, both of them, in the main, extremely just, are found to be almost inseparable) cannot forbear regretting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they would gladly reduce the greater part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers coolly on the subject it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Europe</span>, than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The more the master is removed from us in place and rank, the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controled; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes between our own subjection, and the freedom, and even dominion of another. The remains which are found of domestic slavery, in the <span class=\"small-capitals\">American</span> colonies, and among some <span class=\"small-capitals\">European</span> nations, would never surely create a desire of rendering it more universal. The little humanity, commonly observed in persons, accustomed, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow-creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient <span class=\"page-break\"></span>alone to disgust us with that unbounded dominion.

At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property of the servants is lodged in the master, their marriage forms his riches, and brings him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled.

The opulent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, though not in the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty.

The comparison is shocking between the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when applied to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, attendance, labour are there dear; and men find their account better in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former.

It is an universal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus <em>man</em> and <em>woman</em>, <em>master</em> and <em>servant</em>, <em>father</em> and <em>son</em>, <em>prince</em> and <em>subject</em>, <em>stranger</em> and <em>citizen</em>, are correlative terms. But the words <em>seaman</em>, <em>carpenter</em>, <em>smith</em>, <em>tailor</em>, &amp;c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seamen, no carpenters, <em>&amp;c.</em> Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Roman</span> emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanced all the other orders of the state: Hence <em>miles</em> and <em>paganus</em> became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to ancient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence <em>clergy</em> and <em>laity</em> are terms opposed in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought by the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Romans</span> from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those which were bred at home, <em>verna</em> would have had a correlative, which would have expressed the former species of slaves.

For the banished nobles, returning in many places, butchered their adversaries at <span class=\"small-capitals\">Phialæ</span>, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Corinth</span>, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Megara</span>, in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Phliasia</span>. In this last place they killed 300 of the people; but these again revolting, killed above 600 of the nobles, and banished the rest; lib. xv. p. 357. In <span class=\"small-capitals\">Arcadia</span> 1400 banished, besides many killed. The banished retired to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Sparta</span> and to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pallantium</span>: The latter were delivered up to their countrymen, and all killed; lib. xv. p. 373. Of the banished from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Argos</span> and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Thebes</span>, there were 509 in the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Spartan</span> army; <em>id.</em> p. 374. Here is a detail of the most remarkable of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Agathocles</span>'s cruelties from the same author. The people before his usurpation had banished 600 nobles; lib. xix. p. 655. Afterwards that tyrant, in concurrence with the people, killed 4000 nobles, and banished 6000; <em>id.</em> p. 647. He killed 4000 people at <span class=\"small-capitals\">Gela</span>; <em>id.</em> p. 741. By <span class=\"small-capitals\">Agathocles</span>'s brother 8000 banished from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Syracuse</span>; lib. xx. p. 757. The inhabitants of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Ægesta</span>, to the number of 40,000, were killed, man, woman, and child; and with tortures, for the sake of their money; <em>id.</em> p. 802. All the relations, to wit, father, brother, children, grandfather, of his <span class=\"small-capitals\">Libyan</span> army, killed; <em>id.</em> p. 803. He killed 7000 exiles after capitulation; <em>id.</em> p. 816. It is to be remarked, that <span class=\"small-capitals\">Agathocles</span> was a man of great sense and courage, and is not to be suspected of wanton cruelty, contrary to the maxims of his age.","subId":"n84.1","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.PA.n84.1","pages":"409-10"},{"type":"note","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Diod.

Whoever is acquainted with the spirit of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greeks</span>, especially of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Thebans</span>, will never suspect, that any of them would desert their country, when it was reduced to such extreme peril and distress. As <span class=\"small-capitals\">Alexander</span> took the town by storm, all those who bore arms were put to the sword without mercy; and they amounted only to 6000 men.

We may therefore conclude that the free citizens in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Thebes</span>, of both sexes and all ages, were near 24,000; the strangers and slaves about 12,000.

The question is, What <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny</span> means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed? The manner in which I conceive it, is this. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The Forum, and consequently the Milliarium, we know, was situated on the banks of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tyber</span>, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Though there were thirty-seven gates to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span>, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the Milliarium. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny</span>, therefore, having assigned the circumference of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span>, and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther method. He supposes all the streets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> is five miles, and its breadth about half as much, besides the scattered suburbs.","subId":"n193.2","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.PA.n193.2","pages":"439"},{"type":"note","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Pere Hardouin</span> understands this passage in the same manner; with regard to <span class=\"page-break\"></span>the laying together the several streets of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> into one line, in order to compose 30,775 paces: But then he supposes, that streets led from the Milliarium to every gate, and that no street exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1.) a semicircular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near thirteen miles, the compass of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> as assigned by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny</span>. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3.)

And <span class=\"small-capitals\">Vossius</span> understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tyber</span> formed the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allowed to be contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pliny</span>, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.)

(5.) <span class=\"small-capitals\">Aurelian</span>'s wall is said by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Vopiscus</span> to have been drawn <em>laxiore ambitu</em>, and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north side of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Tyber</span>; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text; since the walls, which remain, and which are supposed to be the same with <span class=\"small-capitals\">Aurelian</span>'s, exceed not twelve miles. It is not probable, that <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span> would diminish from <span class=\"small-capitals\">Augustus</span> to <span class=\"small-capitals\">Aurelian</span>. It remained still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Maximus</span> and <span class=\"small-capitals\">Balbinus</span>, ever affected the city. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Caracalla</span> is said by <span class=\"small-capitals\">Aurelius Victor</span> to have encreased <span class=\"small-capitals\">Rome</span>.
