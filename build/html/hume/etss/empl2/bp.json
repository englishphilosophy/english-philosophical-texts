If we consider, indeed, the small number of inhabitants in any one republic, compared to the whole, the great difficulty of forming sieges in those times, and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman among that noble people; we shall conclude, that the balance of power was, of itself, sufficiently secured in <span class=\"small-capitals\">Greece</span>, and needed not to have been guarded with that caution which may be requisite in other ages. But whether we ascribe the shifting of sides in all the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Grecian</span> republics to <em>jealous emulation</em> or <em>cautious politics</em>, the effects were alike, and every prevailing power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it, and that often composed of its former friends and allies.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.BP.4","pages":"334"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The same principle, call it envy or prudence, which produced the <em>Ostracism</em> of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Athens</span>, and <em>Petalism</em> of <span class=\"small-capitals\">Syracuse</span>, and expelled every citizen whose fame or power overtopped the rest; the same principle, I say, naturally discovered itself in foreign politics, and soon raised enemies to the leading state, however moderate in the exercise of its authority.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.EMPL2.BP.5","pages":"334"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <span class=\"small-capitals\">Persian</span> monarch was really, in his force, a petty prince, compared to the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Grecian</span> republics; and therefore it behoved him, from views of safety more than from emulation, to interest himself in their quarrels, and to support the weaker side in every contest.
