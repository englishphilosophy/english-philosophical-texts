The epithets <em>sociable</em>, <em>good-natured</em>, <em>humane</em>, <em>merciful</em>, <em>grateful</em>, <em>friendly</em>, <em>generous</em>, <em>beneficent</em>, or their equivalents, are known in all languages, and universally express the highest merit, which <em>human nature</em> is capable of attaining. Where these amiable qualities are attended with birth and power and eminent abilities, and display themselves in the good government or useful instruction of mankind, they seem even to raise the possessors of them above the rank of <em>human nature</em>, and make them approach in some measure to the divine. Exalted capacity, undaunted courage, prosperous success; these may only expose a hero or politician to the envy and ill-will of the public: But as soon as the praises are added of humane and beneficent; when instances are displayed of lenity, tenderness, or friendship; envy itself is silent, or joins the general voice of approbation and applause.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.ETSS.EPM.2.1","pages":"176"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When <span class=\"small-capitals\">Pericles</span>, the great <span class=\"small-capitals\">Athenian</span> statesman and general, was on his death-bed, his surrounding friends, deeming him now insensible, began to indulge their sorrow for their expiring patron, by enumerating his great qualities and <span class=\"page-break\"></span>successes, his conquests and victories, the unusual length of his administration, and his nine trophies erected over the enemies of the republic. <em>You forget</em>, cries the dying hero, who had heard all, <em>you forget the most eminent of my praises, while you dwell so much on those vulgar advantages, in which fortune had a principal share.

A high ambition, an elevated courage, is apt, says <span class=\"small-capitals\">Cicero</span>, in less perfect characters, to degenerate into a turbulent ferocity. The more social and softer virtues are there chiefly to be regarded.

It must, indeed, be confessed, that by doing good only, can a man truly enjoy the advantages of being eminent. His exalted station, of itself, but the more exposes him to danger and tempest.

These, indeed, sufficiently engage every heart, on the first apprehension of them; and it is difficult to abstain from some sally of panegyric, as often as they occur in discourse or reasoning. But our object here being more the speculative, <span class=\"page-break\"></span>than the practical part of morals, it will suffice to remark, (what will readily, I believe, be allowed) that no qualities are more intitled to the general good-will and approbation of mankind than beneficence and humanity, friendship and gratitude, natural affection and public spirit, or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy with others, and a generous concern for our kind and species. These, wherever they appear, seem to transfuse themselves, in a manner, into each beholder, and to call forth, in their own behalf, the same favourable and affectionate sentiments, which they exert on all around.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.ETSS.EPM.2.5","pages":"177-8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We may observe, that, in displaying the praises of any humane, beneficent man, there is one circumstance which never fails to be amply insisted on, namely, the happiness and satisfaction, derived to society from his intercourse and good offices. To his parents, we are apt to say, he endears himself by his pious attachment and duteous care, still more than by the connexions of nature. His children never feel his authority, but when employed for their advantage. With him, the ties of love are consolidated by beneficence and friendship. The ties of friendship approach, in a fond observance of each obliging office, to those of love and inclination. His domestics and dependants have in him a sure resource; and no longer dread the power of fortune, but so far as she exercises it over him. From him the hungry receive food, the naked cloathing, the ignorant and slothful skill and industry. Like the sun, an inferior minister of providence, he cheers, invigorates, and sustains the surrounding world.","subId":"6","id":"Hume.ETSS.EPM.2.6","pages":"178"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If confined to private life, the sphere of his activity is narrower; but his influence is all benign and gentle.
