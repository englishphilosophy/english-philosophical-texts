All the World conspires to oppose and contradict me; tho' such is my Weakness, that I feel all my Opinions loosen and fall of themselves, when unsupported by the Approbation of <span class=\"margin-comment\">460.</span> others.— Can I be sure, that, in leaving all established Opinions, I am following Truth? and by what Criterion shall I distinguish her, even if <em>Fortune</em> should at last guide me on her Footsteps? After the most accurate and exact of my Reasonings, I can give no Reason why I should assent to it; and feel nothing but a strong Propensity to consider Objects strongly in that View under which they <span class=\"margin-comment\">461.</span> appear to me.— The Memory, Senses, and Understanding, are all of them founded on the <em>Imagination</em>.— No Wonder a Principle so inconstant and fallacious should lead us into Errors, when implicitely followed (as it must be) in all its <span class=\"margin-comment\">464.</span> Variations.— I have already shown, that the Understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general Principles, <em>entirely</em> subverts itself, and leaves not the <em>lowest Degree</em> <span class=\"page-break\"></span>of Evidence in any Proposition either in Philosophy or <span class=\"margin-comment\">465.</span> common Life.— We have no Choice left, <span class=\"margin-comment\">466.</span> but betwixt a <em>false Reason</em> and <em>none at <span class=\"margin-comment\">467.</span> all</em>.— Where am I, or what? From what Causes do I derive my Existence, and to what Condition shall I return? Whose Favour shall I court, and whose Anger must I dread? What Beings surround me? On whom have I any Influence, or who have any Influence on me? I am confounded with all these Questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable Condition imaginable, invironed with the deepest Darkness, and utterly deprived of the Use of every Member <span class=\"margin-comment\">468.</span> and Faculty.— If I must be <em>a Fool</em>, as all those who reason or believe any Thing certainly are, my Follies shall at least be <span class=\"margin-comment\">469.</span> natural and agreeable.— In all the Incidents of Life, we ought still to preserve our Scepticism: If we believe that <em>Fire warms</em>, or <em>Water refreshes</em>, 'tis only because it costs us <em>too much Pains</em> to think otherwise; nay, if we are Philosophers, <em>it ought only</em> to be upon sceptical Principles. <span class=\"margin-comment\">470.</span> — I cannot forbear having a Curiosity to be acquainted with the Principles of moral Good and Evil, <em>&amp;c</em>. I am concerned for the Condition of the <em>learned World</em>, which lies under such a deplorable Ignorance in all these Particulars. I feel an Ambition arise in me of contributing to the Instruction of Mankind, and of acquiring <em>a Name by my Inventions and Discoveries</em>.— Should I endeavour to banish these Sentiments, I feel I should be a Loser in point of Pleasure; and this is the Origin of my Philosophy.</q>","subId":"6","id":"Hume.LG.6","pages":"420-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Agreeable to this summary View, he tells us, <em>p.</em> 123. <q>Let us fix our Attention <em>out of ourselves</em> as much as possible.— We really never advance a Step <em>beyond ourselves</em>; nor can conceive any Kind of Existence, but these Perceptions which have appeared in that narrow Compass: This is the Universe of the Imagination, nor have we any Idea but what is there produced.</q>— Accordingly, <q>An Opinion or Belief may be most accurately <span class=\"margin-comment\">172.</span> defined, <em>A lively Idea related or associated <span class=\"margin-comment\">321.</span> with a present Impression</em>; and is more properly an Act of the sensitive than of the cogitive Part of our Natures.</q> And, <span class=\"margin-comment\">363.</span> <q>Belief in general consists in nothing but <span class=\"margin-comment\">122.</span> the Vivacity of an Idea. Again, the Idea of <em>Existence</em> is the very same with the Idea of what we conceive to be existent. — Any Idea we please to form is the Idea of a Being; and the Idea of a Being is any Idea we please to form. And as to the Notion of an external Existence, when taken for something specifically different from our Perceptions, we have shown its <span class=\"margin-comment\">330.</span> Absurdity: And what we call a Mind is nothing but a Heap or Collection of different Perceptions united together by certain Relations, and supposed, tho' falsly, <span class=\"margin-comment\">361.</span> to be endowed with a perfect Simplicity.</q> <span class=\"margin-comment\">370.</span> And, <q>The only Existence, of which we are certain, are Perceptions. <span class=\"margin-comment\">438.</span> When I enter most intimately into what I call <em>myself</em>, I always stumble on some particular Perception or other.— I never can catch <em>myself</em> at any Time without a Perception, and never can observe <em>any <span class=\"margin-comment\">439.</span> Thing but the Perception</em>.— If any one think he has a different Notion of himself, I must confess I can reason no longer with him.— I may venture to affirm of the rest of Mankind, that they are nothing but a Bundle of Perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable Rapidity, and are in a perpetual Flux and Movement.</q>— And lest the Reader should forget to apply all this to the Supreme Mind, and the Existence of the First Cause, he has a long Disquisition <span class=\"page-break\"></span>concerning <em>Causes</em> and <em>Effects</em>, the Sum of <span class=\"margin-comment\">321.</span> which amounts to this, That all our Reasonings <span class=\"margin-comment\">138.</span> concerning Causes and Effects are derived from <em>nothing</em> but <em>Custom</em>: That, <q>if any pretend to define a Cause by saying it is something productive of another, 'tis evident he would say nothing; for <span class=\"margin-comment\">298.</span> what does he mean by Production? That we may define a Cause to be <em>an Object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the Objects resembling the former are placed in like Relations of Precedency and Contiguity to these Objects that resemble the latter</em>; or, a <em>Cause is an Object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the Idea of the one determines the Mind to form the Idea of the other, and the Impression of the one to form a more lively Idea of the other</em>.</q> From these clear and plain Definitions he infers, <q>That all Causes are of the same Kind; and there is no Foundation for the Distinction betwixt efficient Causes, and Causes <em>sine qua non</em>; or betwixt <em>efficient</em> Causes, and formal and material, and exemplary, <span class=\"margin-comment\">300.</span> and final Causes: And that there is but one Kind of Necessity, and <span class=\"margin-comment\">301.</span> the common Distinction betwixt Moral and Physical is without any Foundation in Nature: And that the Distinction we often make betwixt Power, and the Exercise of it, is equally without Foundation: And that the Necessity of a Cause to every Beginning of Existence, is not founded on any Arguments demonstrative or intuitive: And in fine, That <em>any Thing</em> may produce <em>any Thing</em>; Creation, Annihilation, Motion, Reason, Volition; all these may arise from one another, or from any other Object we can imagine.</q> This curious <em>Nostrum</em> he often repeats, <span class=\"margin-comment\">284.</span> <em>p.</em> 430, 434. Again he tells us, <q>That when we talk of any Being, whether of a Superior or Inferior Nature, as endowed with a Power or Force proportioned to any Effect,— We have really no distinct Meaning, and make Use only of common Words, without any clear and <span class=\"margin-comment\">294.</span> determinate Ideas. And if we have really no Idea of Power or Efficacy in any Object, or of any real Connection betwixt Causes and Effects, 'twill be to little Purpose to prove that an Efficacy is necessary in all Operations. We do not understand our own Meaning in talking so, but ignorantly confound Ideas which are intirely distinct from each <span class=\"margin-comment\">291.</span> other.</q> Again he says, <q>The Efficacy or Energy of Causes is neither placed in the Causes themselves, nor in the Deity, nor in the Concurrence of these two Principles, but belongs entirely to the Soul (<em>or the Bundle of Perceptions</em>) which considers the Union of two or more Objects in all past Instances: 'Tis here that the real Power of Causes is placed, along with their Connection and Necessity. And in fine, we may observe a Conjunction or a Relation of Cause <em>and Effect between different Perceptions</em>, but can never observe it between Perceptions and Objects.</q> 'Tis impossible therefore, that, from the Existence or any of the Qualities of the former, we can ever form any Conclusion concerning the Existence of the latter, or ever satisfy our Reason in this Particular with regard to the Existence of a Supreme Being. 'Tis well known that this Principle, <em>Whatever begins to exist must have a Cause of Existence</em>, is the first Step in the Argument for the Being of a Supreme Cause; and that, without it, 'tis impossible to go one Step further in that Argument. Now this Maxim he is at great Pains from <em>p.</em> 141. to explode, and to show, <q>That it is neither intuitively nor demonstratively certain;</q> and he says, <q>Reason can never satisfy us that the Existence of any <span class=\"page-break\"></span>Object does ever imply that of <span class=\"margin-comment\">173.</span> another. So that, when we pass from the Impression of one to the Idea and Belief of another, we are not determined <span class=\"margin-comment\">172.</span> by Reason, but by Custom.</q> In a marginal Note on the preceeding Page he says, <q>In that Proposition, <em>God is</em>, or indeed any other which regards Existence, the Idea of Existence is no distinct Idea which we unite with that of the Object, and which is capable of forming a compound Idea by the Union.</q> Concerning <span class=\"margin-comment\">280.</span> this Principle, <em>That the Deity is the prime Mover of the Universe, who first created Matter, and gave its original Impulse, and likewise supports its Existence, and successively bestows on it its Motions</em>; he says, <q>This Opinion is certainly very curious, but it will appear superfluous to examine it in this Place.— For, if the very Idea be derived from an Impression, the Idea of a Deity proceeds from the same Origin; and, if no Impression implies any Force or Efficacy, 'tis equally impossible to discover, or even imagine, any such active Principle in the Deity.— Since Philosophers therefore have concluded, that Matter cannot be endowed with any efficacious Principle, because it is impossible to discover in it such a Principle; the same Course of Reasoning should determine them to exclude it from the Supreme Being: Or if they esteem that Opinion absurd and impious, as it really is, I shall tell them how they may avoid it, and that is, by <em>concluding from the very first</em>, that they have no adequate Idea of Power or Efficacy in any Object; since neither in Body nor Spirit, neither in Superior nor Inferior Natures, are they able to discover one single Instance of it.</q> And <span class=\"margin-comment\">432.</span> says he, <q>We have no Idea of a Being endowed with any Power, much less of one endowed with infinite Power.</q>","subId":"7","id":"Hume.LG.7","pages":"421-3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Concerning <em>the Immateriality of the Soul</em> (from which the Argument is taken for its natural Immortality, or that it cannot perish by Dissolution as the Body) he <span class=\"margin-comment\">431.</span> says, <q>We certainly may conclude that Motion may be and actually is the Cause of <span class=\"margin-comment\">434.</span> Thought and Perception: And no wonder, for any Thing may be the Cause or Effect of <em>any Thing</em>; which evidently gives the Advantage to the Materialists <span class=\"margin-comment\">418.</span> above their Adversaries.</q> But yet more plainly, <q>I assert, says he, that the Doctrine of the Immateriality, Simplicity, and Indivisibility of a thinking Substance, <em>is a true Atheism</em>, and will serve to justify <em>all</em> these Sentiments for which <em>Spinoza</em> <span class=\"margin-comment\">419.</span> is so universally infamous.</q> This hideous Hypothesis is almost the same with that of the Immateriality of the Soul, which has <span class=\"margin-comment\">423.</span> become so popular. And again he endeavours to prove, that all the Absurdities which have been found in the Systems of <em>Spinoza</em>, may likewise be discovered in that <span class=\"margin-comment\">425.</span> of the Theologians: And concludes, that <q>We cannot advance one Step towards the establishing the Simplicity and Immateriality of the Soul, without preparing the Way for a dangerous and irrecoverable Atheism.</q>","subId":"8","id":"Hume.LG.8","pages":"423"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Author's Sentiments in Morality we have in Vol. 3. printed for <em>T.

That Justice is not a natural, but an artificial Virtue; and gives one pretty odd <span class=\"margin-comment\">128.</span> Reason for it: <q>We may conclude, that the Laws of Justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be derived <span class=\"margin-comment\">101.</span> from Nature.

In Reality, a Philosopher who affects to doubt of the Maxims of <em>common Reason</em>, and even of his <em>Senses</em>, declares sufficiently that he is not in earnest, and that he intends not to advance an Opinion which he would recommend as Standards of Judgment and Action. All he means by these Scruples is to abate the Pride of <em>mere human Reasoners</em>, by showing them, that even with regard to Principles which seem the clearest, and which they are necessitated from the strongest Instincts of Nature to embrace, they are not able to attain a full Consistence and absolute Certainty. <em>Modesty</em> then, and <em>Humility</em>, with regard to the Operations of our natural Faculties, is the Result of <em>Scepticism</em>; not an universal Doubt, which it is impossible <span class=\"page-break\"></span>for any Man to support, and which the first and most trivial Accident in Life must immediately disconcert and destroy.","subId":"21","id":"Hume.LG.21","pages":"425-6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How is such a Frame of Mind prejudicial to Piety?

All the antient Fathers, as well as our first Reformers, are copious in representing the Weakness and Uncertainty of <em>mere</em> human Reason. And Monsieur <em>Huet</em> the learned Bishop of <em>Avaranches</em> (so celebrated for his <em>Demonstration Evangelique</em> which contains all the great Proofs of the Christian Religion) wrote also a Book on this very Topick, wherein he endeavours to revive all the Doctrines of the antient <em>Scepticks</em> or <em>Pyrrhonians</em>.","subId":"24","id":"Hume.LG.24","pages":"426"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In Reality, whence come all the various Tribes of Hereticks, the <em>Arians</em>, <em>Socinians</em> and <em>Deists</em>, but from too great a Confidence in mere human Reason, which they regard as the <em>Standard</em> of every Thing, and which they will not submit to the superior Light of Revelation?

The Author is charged with Opinions leading to <em>downright Atheism</em>, chiefly by denying this Principle, <em>That whatever begins to exist must have a Cause of Existence</em>. To give you a Notion of the Extravagance of this Charge, I must enter into a little Detail. It is common for Philosophers to distinguish the Kinds of Evidence into <em>intuitive</em>, <em>demonstrative</em>, <em>sensible</em>, and <em>moral</em>; by which they intend <em>only</em> to mark a Difference betwixt them, not to denote a Superiority of one above another. <em>Moral Certainty</em> may reach as <em>high</em> a Degree of Assurance as <em>Mathematical</em>; and our Senses are surely to be comprised amongst the clearest <span class=\"page-break\"></span>and most convincing of all Evidences. Now, it being the Author's Purpose, in the Pages cited in the Specimen, to examine the Grounds of that Proposition; he used the Freedom of disputing the common Opinion, that it was founded on <em>demonstrative</em> or <em>intuitive Certainty</em>; but asserts, that it is supported by <em>moral Evidence</em>, and is followed by a Conviction of the same Kind with these Truths, <em>That all Men must die</em>, and that <em>the Sun will rise To-morrow</em>.

Bishop <em>Tillotson</em> has used a Degree of Freedom on this Head, which I would not willingly allow myself; 'tis in his excellent Sermon <em>concerning the Wisdom of being religious</em>, where he says, <em>That the Being of a God is not capable of Demonstration, but of moral Evidence</em>.

Had the Author really denied the Truth of the foregoing Proposition (which the most superficial Reader cannot think ever entred his Head) still he could not properly be charged as designing to invalidate any one Argument that any Philosopher has employed for a <em>Divine Existence</em>; that is only an Inference and Construction of others, which he may refuse if he thinks proper.","subId":"28","id":"Hume.LG.28","pages":"427"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus you may judge of the Candor of the whole Charge, when you see the assigning of <em>one Kind of Evidence</em> for a Proposition, instead of <em>another</em>, is called denying that Proposition; that the invalidating only <em>one Kind</em> of Argument for the Divine Existence is called <em>positive Atheism</em>; nay, that the weakning only of <em>one individual Argument</em> of that Kind is called rejecting that <em>whole Species of Argument</em>, and the Inferences of others are ascribed to the Author as his real Opinion.","subId":"29","id":"Hume.LG.29","pages":"427"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis impossible ever to satisfy a captious Adversary, but it would be easy for me to convince the severest Judge, that all the solid Arguments for Natural Religion retain their full Force upon the Author's Principles concerning Causes and Effects, and that there is no Necessity even for altering the common Methods of expressing or conceiving these Arguments. The Author has indeed asserted, That we can judge only of the Operations of Causes by Experience, <span class=\"page-break\"></span>and that, reasoning <em>a priori</em>, any thing might appear able to produce any thing. We could not know that Stones would descend, or Fire burn, had we not Experience of these Effects; and indeed, without such Experience, we could not certainly infer the Existence of one Thing from that of another. This is no great Paradox, but seems to have been the Opinion of several Philosophers, and seems the most obvious and familiar Sentiment on that Subject; but, tho' all Inferences concerning Matter of Fact be thus resolved into Experience, these Inferences are noway weakned by such an Assertion, but on the contrary will be found to acquire more Force, as long as Men are disposed to trust to their Experience rather than to mere human Reasoning. Wherever I see Order, I infer from Experience that <em>there</em>, there hath been Design and Contrivance. And the same Principle which leads me into this Inference, when I contemplate a Building, regular and beautiful in its whole Frame and Structure; the same Principle obliges me to infer an infinitely perfect Architect, from the infinite Art and Contrivance which is display'd in the whole Fabrick of the Universe. Is not this the Light in which this Argument hath been placed by all Writers concerning Natural Religion?","subId":"30","id":"Hume.LG.30","pages":"427-8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"III. The next Proof of Atheism is so unaccountable, that I know not what to make of it. Our Author indeed asserts, after the present pious and learned Bishop of <em>Cloyne</em>, That we have no <em>abstract</em> or <em>general Ideas</em>, properly so speaking; and that those Ideas, which are called general, are nothing but particular Ideas affixed to general Terms. Thus, when I think of a Horse in general, I must always conceive that Horse as black or white, fat or lean, <em>&amp;c</em>. and can form no Notion of a Horse that is not of some particular Colour or Size. In Prosecution of the same Topick, the Author hath said, That we have no general Idea of Existence, distinct from every particular Existence. But a Man must have strange Sagacity, that could discover Atheism in so harmless a Proposition. This, in my Opinion, might be justified before the University of <em>Salamanca</em>, or a <em>Spanish</em> Inquisition. I do indeed believe, that, when we assert the Existence of a Deity, we do not form a general abstract Idea of Existence, which we unite with the Idea of God, and which is capable of forming a compound Idea by Union; but this is the Case with regard to every Proposition concerning Existence. So that, by this Course of Reasoning, we must deny the Existence of every Thing, even of ourselves, of which at least even the Accuser himself will admit our Author is perswaded.","subId":"31","id":"Hume.LG.31","pages":"428"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"IV. Ere answering the fourth Charge, I must use the Freedom to deliver a short History of a particular Opinion in Philosophy. When Men considered the several Effects and Operations of Nature, they were led to examine into the Force or Power by which they were performed; and they divided into several Opinions upon this Head, according as their <em>other</em> Principles were more or less favourable to Religion. The Followers of <em>Epicurus</em> and <em>Strato</em> asserted, That this Force was original and inherent in Matter, and, operating blindly, produced all the various Effects which we behold. The <em>Platonick</em> and <em>Peripatetick</em> Schools, perceiving the Absurdity of this Proposition, ascribed the Origin of all Force to one primary efficient Cause, who first bestowed it on Matter, and successively <span class=\"page-break\"></span>guided it in all its Operations. But all the antient Philosophers agreed, that there was a real Force in Matter, either original or derived; and that it was really Fire which burnt, and Food that nourished, when we observed any of these Effects to follow upon the Operations of these Bodies: The Schoolmen supposed also a real Power in Matter, to whose Operations however the continual Concurrence of the Deity was requisite, as well as to the Support of that Existence which had been bestowed on Matter, and which they considered as a perpetual Creation. No one, till <em>Des Cartes</em> and <em>Malbranche</em>, ever entertained an Opinion that Matter had no Force either <em>primary</em> or <em>secondary</em>, and <em>independent</em> or <em>concurrent</em>, and could not so much as properly be called an <em>Instrument</em> in the Hands of the Deity, to serve any of the Purposes of Providence. These Philosophers last-mentioned substituted the Notion of <em>occasional Causes</em>, by which it was asserted that a Billiard Ball did not move another by its Impulse, but was only the Occasion why the Deity, in pursuance of general Laws, bestowed Motion on the second Ball. But, tho' this Opinion be very innocent, it never gained great Credit, especially in <em>England</em>, where it was considered as too much contrary to received popular Opinions, and too little supported by Philosophical Arguments, ever to be admitted as any Thing but a <em>mere Hypothesis</em>. <em>Cudworth</em>, <em>Lock</em> and <em>Clark</em> make little or no mention of it. Sir <em>Isaac Newton</em> (tho' some of his Followers have taken a different Turn of thinking) plainly rejects it, by substituting the Hypothesis of an Ætherial Fluid, not the immediate Volition of the Deity, as the Cause of Attraction. And, in short, this has been a Dispute left entirely to the Arguments of Philosophers, and in which Religion has never been supposed to be in the least concerned.","subId":"32","id":"Hume.LG.32","pages":"428-9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now it is evidently concerning this <em>Cartesian Doctrine</em>, of <em>secondary Causes</em>, the Author is treating, when he says, (in the Passage referred to in the Charge) <em>That it was a curious Opinion, but which it would appear superfluous to examine in that Place</em>.","subId":"33","id":"Hume.LG.33","pages":"429"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Topick there handled is somewhat abstract: But I believe any Reader will easily perceive the Truth of this Assertion, and that the Author is far from pretending to deny (as asserted in the Charge) <em>God's being the first Cause and prime Mover of the Universe</em>.

By the <em>natural Virtues</em> he plainly understands <em>Compassion</em> and <em>Generosity</em>, and such as we are immediately carried to by a <em>natural Instinct</em>; and by the <em>artificial Virtues</em> he means <em>Justice</em>, <em>Loyalty</em>, and such as require, along with a <em>natural Instinct</em>, a certain Reflection on the general Interests of Human Society, and a Combination with others. In the same Sense, Sucking is an Action natural to Man, and Speech is artificial. But what is there in this Doctrine that can be supposed in the least pernicious? Has he not expresly asserted, That Justice, in another Sense of the Word, is so natural to Man, that no Society of Men, and even no individual Member of any Society, was ever entirely devoid of all Sense of it? Some Persons (tho' without any Reason, in my Opinion) are displeased with Mr. <em>Hutchison</em>'s Philosophy, in founding all the Virtues so much on <em>Instinct</em>, and admitting so little of <em>Reason</em> and <em>Reflection</em>.

The most careless Reader must perceive that he does not understand <em>Moral</em> in such an extended Sense, as to deny the Obligation of Promises, independent of Society; seeing he not only asserts what is above-represented, but likewise that the Laws of Justice are universal, and perfectly inflexible. It is evident, that suppose Mankind, in some primitive unconnected State, should by some Means come to the Knowledge of the Nature of those Things which we call Contracts and Promises; that this Knowledge would have laid them under no such actual Obligation, if not placed in such Circumstances as give rise to these Contracts.","subId":"39","id":"Hume.LG.39","pages":"430"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am sorry I should be obliged to cite from my Memory, and cannot mention Page and Chapter so accurately as the Accuser.

I am indeed of Opinion, that the Author had better delayed the publishing of that Book; not on account of any dangerous Principles contained in it, but because on more mature Consideration he might have rendered it much less imperfect by further Corrections and Revisals. I must not at the same Time omit observing, that nothing can be wrote so accurately or innocently, which may not be perverted by such Arts as have been imployed on this Occasion.
