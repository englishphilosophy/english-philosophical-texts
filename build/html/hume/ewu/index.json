These essays are collected together here, alongside the two unpublished essays <cite>Of Suicide</cite> and <cite>Of the Immortality of the Soul</cite>. These latter were printed in 1755, intended for what became the <cite>Four Dissertations</cite> of 1757, but Hume soon regretted the decision and had them removed, writing the essay <cite>Of the Standard of Taste</cite> to fill their place. A few copies of the 1755 print were circulated (against Hume’s wishes), which therefore serves as our copytext. In preparing the critical text here, the copy held in the National Library of Scotland, containing several modifications in Hume’s hand, was consulted.","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"<h1>ESSAYS,</h1> <h2>MORAL</h2> <h3><span class=\"small-capitals\">and</span></h3> <h2>POLITICAL.</h2> <h4>Withdrawn Essays.</h4> ","id":"Hume.EWU"}],"texts":[{"id":"Hume.EWU.IM","imported":true,"title":"Of Impudence and Modesty","breadcrumb":"Of Impudence and Modesty","published":[1741]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.LM","imported":true,"title":"Of Love and Marriage","breadcrumb":"Of Love and Marriage","published":[1741]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.SH","imported":true,"title":"Of the Study of History","breadcrumb":"Of the Study of History","published":[1741]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.Av","imported":true,"title":"Of Avarice","breadcrumb":"Of Avarice","published":[1741]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.EW","imported":true,"title":"Of Essay-Writing","breadcrumb":"Of Essay-Writing","published":[1742]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.MP","imported":true,"title":"Of Moral Prejudices","breadcrumb":"Of Moral Prejudices","published":[1742]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.MS","imported":true,"title":"Of the Middle Station of Life","breadcrumb":"Of the Middle Station of Life","published":[1742]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.CR","imported":true,"title":"A Character of Sir Robert Walpole","breadcrumb":"A Character of Sir Robert Walpole","published":[1742]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.Su","imported":true,"title":"Of Suicide","breadcrumb":"Of Suicide","published":[1777]},{"id":"Hume.EWU.IS","imported":true,"title":"Of the Immortality of the Soul","breadcrumb":"Of the Immortality of the Soul","published":[1777]}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hume","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":1739,"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hume.THN","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Treatise of Human Nature","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1739,1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise"},{"id":"Hume.A","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"An Abstract of a Book Lately Published","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Abstract"},{"id":"Hume.EWU","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1741,1742,1756],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished"},{"id":"Hume.LG","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1745],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Letter from a Gentleman"},{"id":"Hume.ETSS","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1758],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays and Treatises"},{"id":"Hume.HE","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"The History of England","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1754,1757,1759,1762],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"History of England"},{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"My Own Life"},{"id":"Hume.DNR","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1779],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues"}]}],"prev":{"id":"Hume.A","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"An Abstract of a Book Lately Published","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Abstract"},"next":{"id":"Hume.LG","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1745],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Letter from a Gentleman"}}
