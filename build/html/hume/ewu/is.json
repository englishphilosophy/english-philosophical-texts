These latter were printed in 1755, intended for what became the <cite>Four Dissertations</cite> of 1757, but Hume soon regretted the decision and had them removed, writing the essay <cite>Of the Standard of Taste</cite> to fill their place. A few copies of the 1755 print were circulated (against Hume’s wishes), which therefore serves as our copytext. In preparing the critical text here, the copy held in the National Library of Scotland, containing several modifications in Hume’s hand, was consulted.","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"<h1>Of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Immortality</span> of the <span class=\"small-capitals\">Soul</span></h1> ","id":"Hume.EWU.IS"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"BY the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the Immortality of the Soul. The arguments for it are commonly derived either from <em>metaphysical</em> topics, or <em>moral</em> or <em>physical</em>. But in reality, it is the gospel, and the gospel alone, that has brought life and immortality to light.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.EWU.IS.1","pages":"590"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I. <span class=\"small-capitals\">Metaphysical</span> topics <del>suppose</del><ins>are founded on the supposition</ins> that the soul is immaterial, and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.EWU.IS.2","pages":"591"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">But</span> just metaphysics teach us, that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an unknown something.
