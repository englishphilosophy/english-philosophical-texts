These latter were printed in 1755, intended for what became the <cite>Four Dissertations</cite> of 1757, but Hume soon regretted the decision and had them removed, writing the essay <cite>Of the Standard of Taste</cite> to fill their place. A few copies of the 1755 print were circulated (against Hume’s wishes), which therefore serves as our copytext.
