These essays are collected together here, alongside the two unpublished essays <cite>Of Suicide</cite> and <cite>Of the Immortality of the Soul</cite>. These latter were printed in 1755, intended for what became the <cite>Four Dissertations</cite> of 1757, but Hume soon regretted the decision and had them removed, writing the essay <cite>Of the Standard of Taste</cite> to fill their place. A few copies of the 1755 print were circulated (against Hume’s wishes), which therefore serves as our copytext.

He began with two volumes on the History of Great Britain (from the Union of the Crowns to the death of James II), published in 1754 and 1757. In 1759 he then published two more volumes, on the House of Tudor. This necessitated changing the title from the <cite>History of Great Britain</cite> to the <cite>History of England</cite>, since he now began the story a century and a half before the union. Finally, in 1762, he published two more volumes tracing the country’s history back even further, all the way to the Celtic Britons and the Roman invasion. In 1763, the first complete set was published, but owing to the size of the work – including the now very large index included in the final volume – it had to be chopped up rather awkwardly into 8 volumes rather than 6. The text here follows the posthumous 1778 edition, which Hume was working on before he died. That edition was also (of necessity) printed in 8 volumes, but it is shown here divided into 6 volumes instead (matching the breaks that appeared in the volumes as they were originally published)."},{"imported":true,"id":"Hume.MOL","title":"My Own Life","breadcrumb":"My Own Life","published":[1777],"sourceDesc":"Hume’s short autobiographical <cite>My Own Life</cite> was published in 1777, coinciding with the posthumous edition of his <cite>Essays and Treatises</cite>.

Because of the sensitive nature of the text, however, he did not publish it in his lifetime, but left instructions to his nephew to publish it after his death. It was printed in 1779, and this edition is naturally our copytext. Fortunately, however, Hume’s own manuscript for the work survives. This manuscript was consulted in drawing up the critical text provided here."}],"publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[]}
