Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a new vivacity, the passions become more violent; and keep pace with the imagination in all its variations. Whether this proceeds from the principle above-mention'd, <em>that any attendant emotion is easily converted into the predominant</em>, I shall not determine. 'Tis sufficient for my present purpose, that we have many instances to confirm this influence of the imagination upon the passions.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.THN.2.3.6.1","pages":"424"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Any</span> pleasure, with which we are acquainted, affects us more than any other, which we own to be superior, but of whose nature we are wholly ignorant. Of the one we can form a particular and determinate idea: The other we conceive under the general notion of pleasure; and 'tis certain, <span class=\"page-break\"></span>that the more general and universal any of our ideas are, the less influence they have upon the imagination. A general idea, tho' it be nothing but a particular one consider'd in a certain view, is commonly more obscure; and that because no particular idea, by which we represent a general one, is ever fix'd or determinate, but may easily be chang'd for other particular ones, which will serve equally in the representation.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.THN.2.3.6.2","pages":"424-5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">There</span> is a noted passage in the history of <em>Greece</em>, which may serve for our present purpose. <em>Themistocles</em> told the <em>Athenians</em>, that he had form'd a design, which wou'd be highly useful to the public, but which 'twas impossible for him to communicate to them without ruining the execution, since its success depended entirely on the secrecy with which it shou'd be conducted. The <em>Athenians</em>, instead of granting him full power to act as he thought fitting, order'd him to communicate his design to <em>Aristides</em>, in whose prudence they had an entire confidence, and whose opinion they were resolv'd blindly to submit to. The design of <em>Themistocles</em> was secretly to set fire to the fleet of all the <em>Grecian</em> commonwealths, which was assembled in a neighbouring port, and which being once destroy'd, wou'd give the <em>Athenians</em> the empire of the sea without any rival. <em>Aristides</em> return'd to the assembly, and told them, that nothing cou'd be more advantageous than the design of <em>Themistocles</em>; but at the same time that nothing cou'd be more unjust: Upon which the people unanimously rejected the project.","subId":"3","id":"Hume.THN.2.3.6.3","pages":"425"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">A late</span> celebrated<a href=\"#n66\"><sup>[66]</sup></a> historian admires this passage of antient history, as one of the most singular that is any where to be met with. <em>Here</em>, says he, <em>they are not philosophers, to whom 'tis easy in their schools to establish the finest maxims and most sublime rules of morality, who decide that interest ought never to prevail above justice. 'Tis a whole people interested in the proposal, which is made to them, who consider it as of importance to the public good, and who notwithstanding reject it <span class=\"page-break\"></span>unanimously, and without hesitation, merely because it is contrary to justice</em>. For my part I see nothing so extraordinary in this proceeding of the <em>Athenians</em>. The same reasons, which render it so easy for philosophers to establish these sublime maxims, tend, in part, to diminish the merit of such a conduct in that people. Philosophers never ballance betwixt profit and honesty, because their decisions are general, and neither their passions nor imaginations are interested in the objects. And tho' in the present case the advantage was immediate to the <em>Athenians</em>, yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage, without being conceiv'd by any particular idea, it must have had a less considerable influence on their imaginations, and have been a less violent temptation, than if they had been acquainted with all its circumstances: Otherwise 'tis difficult to conceive, that a whole people, unjust and violent as men commonly are, shou'd so unanimously have adher'd to justice, and rejected any considerable advantage.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.THN.2.3.6.4","pages":"425-6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Any</span> satisfaction, which we lately enjoy'd, and of which the memory is fresh and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than another of which the traces are decay'd, and almost obliterated. From whence does this proceed, but that the memory in the first case assists the fancy, and gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions? The image of the past pleasure being strong and violent, bestows these qualities on the idea of the future pleasure, which is connected with it by the relation of resemblance.","subId":"5","id":"Hume.THN.2.3.6.5","pages":"426"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">A pleasure</span>, which is suitable to the way of life, in which we are engag'd, excites more our desires and appetites than another, which is foreign to it.
