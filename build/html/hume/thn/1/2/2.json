But our ideas are adequate representations of the most minute <del>part</del><ins>parts</ins> of extension; and thro' whatever divisions and subdivisions we may suppose these parts to be arriv'd at, they can never become inferior to some ideas, which we form. The plain consequence is, that whatever <em>appears</em> impossible and contradictory upon the comparison of these ideas, must be <em>really</em> impossible and contradictory, without any farther excuse or evasion.","subId":"1","id":"Hume.THN.1.2.2.1","pages":"29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">Every</span> thing capable of being infinitely divided contains an infinite number of parts; otherwise the division would be stopt short by the indivisible parts, which we should immediately arrive at. If therefore any finite extension be infinitely divisible, it can be no contradiction to suppose, that a finite extension contains an infinite number of parts: And <em>vice versa</em>, if it be a contradiction to suppose, that a finite extension contains an infinite number of parts, no finite extension can be infinitely divisible. But that this latter supposition is absurd, I easily convince myself by the consideration of my clear ideas. I first take the least idea I can form of a part of extension, and being certain that there is nothing more minute than this idea, I conclude, that whatever I discover by its means must be a real quality of extension. I then repeat this idea once, twice, thrice, <em>&amp;c.</em> and find the compound idea of extension, arising from its repetition, always to augment, and become double, triple, quadruple, <em>&amp;c.</em> till at last it swells up to a considerable bulk, greater or smaller, in proportion as I repeat more or less the same idea. When I stop in the addition of parts, the idea of <span class=\"page-break\"></span>extension ceases to augment; and were I to carry on the addition <em>in infinitum</em>, I clearly perceive, that the idea of extension must also become infinite. Upon the whole, I conclude, that the idea of an infinite number of parts is individually the same idea with that of an infinite extension; that no finite extension is capable of containing an infinite number of parts; and consequently that no finite extension is infinitely divisible<a href=\"#n6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.","subId":"2","id":"Hume.THN.1.2.2.2","pages":"29-30"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">I may</span> subjoin another argument propos'd by a noted author, <a href=\"#n7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which seems to me very strong and beautiful. 'Tis evident, that existence in itself belongs only to unity, and is never applicable to number, but on account of the unites, of which the number is compos'd. Twenty men may be said to exist; but 'tis only because one, two, three, four, <em>&amp;c.</em> are existent; and if you deny the existence of the latter, that of the former falls of course. 'Tis therefore utterly absurd to suppose any number to exist, and yet deny the existence of unites; and as extension is always a number, according to the common sentiment of metaphysicians, and never resolves itself into any unite or indivisible quantity, it follows, that extension can never at all exist. 'Tis in vain to reply, that any determinate quantity of extension is an unite; but such-a-one as admits of an infinite number of fractions, and is inexhaustible in its sub-divisions. For by the same rule these twenty men <em>may be consider'd as an unite</em>. The whole globe of the earth, nay the whole universe <em>may be consider'd as an unite</em>. That term of unity is merely a fictitious denomination, which the mind may apply to any quantity of objects it collects together; nor can such an unity any more exist alone than number can, as being in reality a <span class=\"page-break\"></span>true number. But the unity, which can exist alone, and whose existence is necessary to that of all number, is of another kind, and must be perfectly indivisible, and incapable of being resolved into any lesser unity.","subId":"3","id":"Hume.THN.1.2.2.3","pages":"30-1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">All</span> this reasoning takes place with regard to time; along with an additional argument, which it may be proper to take notice of. 'Tis a property inseparable from time, and which in a manner constitutes its essence, that each of its parts succeeds another, and that none of them, however contiguous, can ever be co-existent. For the same reason, that the year 1737. cannot concur with the present year 1738. every moment must be distinct from, and posterior or antecedent to another. 'Tis certain then, that time, as it exists, must be compos'd of indivisible moments. For if in time we could never arrive at an end of division, and if each moment, as it succeeds another, were not perfectly single and indivisible, there would be an infinite number of co-existent moments, or parts of time; which I believe will be allow'd to be an arrant contradiction.","subId":"4","id":"Hume.THN.1.2.2.4","pages":"31"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"<span class=\"small-capitals\">The</span> infinite divisibility of space implies that of time, as is evident from the nature of motion.

'Tis not in demonstrations as in probabilities, that difficulties can take place, and one argument counter-ballance another, and diminish its authority. A demonstration, if just, admits of no opposite difficulty; and if not just, 'tis a mere sophism, and consequently can never be a difficulty. 'Tis either irresistible, or has no manner of force. To talk therefore of objections <span class=\"page-break\"></span>and replies, and ballancing of arguments in such a question as this, is to confess, either that human reason is nothing but a play of words, or that the person himself, who talks so, has not a capacity equal to such subjects.
