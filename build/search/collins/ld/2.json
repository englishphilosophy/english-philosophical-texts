They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","author":"Anthony Collins","birth":1676,"death":1729,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"A Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell;\nContaining some Remarks on a (pretended) Demonstration of the Immateriality and Natural Immortality of the Soul, in Mr. Clark's Answer to his late Epistolary Discouse, &c.","id":"Collins.LD.2"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Collins","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":1707,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Collins.LD","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD"},{"id":"Collins.EUR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"An Essay concerning the Use of Reason","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1707],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Collins.DFT","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Collins.FDF","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Farther Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Collins.IHL","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Philosophical Inquiry concerning Human Liberty","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1717],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Collins.DCR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse on the Grounds and Reason of the Christian Religion","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1724],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"},{"id":"Collins.DLN","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Dissertation on Libery and Necessity","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1729],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male"}]},{"id":"Collins.LD","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD"}],"prev":{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.1","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's Letter to Dodwell","published":[1706]},"next":{"id":"ClarkeS.LD.3","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"A Defense of an Argument made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Clarke's First Defence","published":[1707]}}
