If there be any thing ever so little amiss or wrong in the inward Frame, the Humour or Temper of the Creature, 'tis readily call'd vicious; and when more than ordinarily wrong, unnatural.

Ask one of these Gentlemen, unawares, when sollicitously careful and busy'd in the great Concerns of his Stable, or Kennel, \"Whether his Hound or Greyhound-Bitch who eats her Puppys, is as natural as the other who nurses 'em?\" and he will think you frantick. Ask him again, \"Whether he thinks the unnatural Creature who acts thus, or the natural-one who does otherwise, is best in its kind, and enjoys it-self the most?\" And he will be inclin'd to think still as strangely of you.

The Creatures who, according to the OEconomy of their Kind, are oblig'd to make themselves Habitations of Defense against the Seasons and other Incidents; they who in some parts of the Year are depriv'd of all Subsistence, and are therefore necessitated to accumulate in another, and to provide withal for the Safety of their collected Stores, are by their Nature indeed as strictly join'd, and with as proper Affections towards their Publick and Community, as the looser Kind, of a more easy Subsistence and Support, are united in what relates merely to their Offspring, and the Propagation of their Species. Of these thorowly associating and confederate-Animals, there are none I have ever heard of, who in Bulk or Strength exceed the Beaver. The major part of these political Animals, and Creatures of a joint Stock, are as inconsiderable as the Race of Ants or Bees. But had Nature assign'd such an OEconomy as this to so puissant an Animal, for instance, as the Elephant, and made him withal as prolifick as those smaller Creatures commonly are; it might have gone hard perhaps with Mankind: And a single Animal, who by his proper Might and Prowess has often decided the Fate of the greatest Battels which have been fought by Human Race, shou'd he have grown up into a Society, with a Genius for Architecture and Mechanicks proportionable to what we observe in those smaller Creatures; we shou'd, with all our invented Machines, have found it hard to dispute with him the Dominion of the Continent.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.2.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Were we in a disinterested View, or with somewhat less Selfishness than ordinary, to consider the OEconomys, Parts, Interests, Conditions, and Terms of Life, which Nature has distributed and assign'd to the several Species of Creatures round us, we shou'd not be apt to think our-selves so hardly dealt with. But Whether our Lot in this respect be just, or equal, is not the Question with us, at present. 'Tis enough that we know \"There is certainly an Assignment and Distribution: That each OEconomy or Part so distributed, is in it-self uniform, fix'd, and invariable: and That if any thing in the Creature be accidentally impair'd; if any thing in the inward Form, the Disposition, Temper or Affections, be contrary or unsutable to the distinct OEconomy or Part, the Creature is wretched and unnatural.\"","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The social or natural Affections, which our Author considers as essential to the Health, Wholeness, or Integrity of the particular Creature, are such as contribute to the Welfare and Prosperity of that Whole or Species, to which he is by Nature join'd.

But as the Design or End of Nature in each Animal-System, is exhibited chiefly in the Support and Propagation of the particular Species; it happens, of consequence, that those Affections of earliest Alliance and mutual Kindness between the Parent and the Offspring, are known more particularly by the name of natural Affection. However, since it is evident that all Defect or Depravity of Affection, which counterworks or opposes the original Constitution and OEconomy of the Creature, is unnatural; it follows, \"That in Creatures who by their particular OEconomy are fitted to the strictest Society and Rule of common Good, the most unnatural of all Affections are those which separate from this Community; and the most truly natural, generous and noble, are those which tend towards Publick Service, and the Interest of the Society at large.\"","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.2.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is the main Problem which our Author in more philosophical Terms demonstrates, in this Treatise, \"That for a Creature whose natural End is Society, to operate as is by Nature appointed him towards the Good of such his Society, or Whole, is in reality to pursue his own natural and proper Good. \" And \"That to operate contrary-wise, or by such Affections as sever from that common Good, or publick Interest, is, in reality, to work towards his own natural and proper Ill. \" Now if Man, as has been prov'd, be justly rank'd in the number of those Creatures whose OEconomy is according to a joint-Stock and publick-Weal; if it be understood, withal, that the only State of his Affections which answers rightly to this publick-Weal, is the regular, orderly, or virtuous State; it necessarily follows, \"That Virtue is his natural Good, and Vice his Misery and Ill.\"","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.2.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for that further Consideration, \"Whether Nature has orderly and justly distributed the several OEconomys or Parts; and Whether the Defects, Failures, or Calamitys of particular Systems are to the advantage of all in general, and contribute to the Perfection of the one common and universal System\"; we must refer to our Author's profounder Speculations in this his Inquiry, and in his following Philosophick Dialogue. But if what he advances in this respect be real, or at least the most probable by far of any Scheme or Representation which can be made of the Universal Nature and Cause of things; it will follow, \"That since Man has been so constituted, by means of his rational Part, as to be conscious of this his more immediate Relation to the Universal System, and Principle of Order and Intelligence; he is not only by Nature sociable, within the Limits of his own Species, or Kind; but in a yet more generous and extensive manner.

Without this, there might be less Safety found, perhaps, in Thinking. Every light Reflection might run us up to the dangerous State of Meditation. And in reality, profound Thinking is many times the Cause of shallow Thought. To prevent this contemplative Habit and Character, of which we see so little good effect in the World, we have reason perhaps to be fond of the diverting Manner in Writing, and Discourse, especially if the Subject be of a solemn kind.

But NATURE will be able still to shift for her-self, and get the better of those Schemes, which need no other Force against them, than that of Horace's single Verse: \n\nDente Lupus, cornu Taurus petit.

Nor wou'd he need be scandaliz'd with the Comparison of a Goat, or Boar, or other of Horace's premeditating Animals, who have more natural Wit, it seems, than our Philosopher; if we may judg of him by his own Hypothesis, which denies the same implanted SENSE and natural Ideas to his own Kind. \n\nCras donaberis Haedo, \n Cui Frons turgida Cornibus \n Primis, &Venerem & Praelia destinat. \n [Lib. iii.
