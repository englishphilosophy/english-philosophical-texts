We are now, in our Commentator-Capacity, arriv'd at length to his second Volume, to which the three Pieces of his first appear preparatory. That they were really so design'd, the Advertisement to the first Edition of his Soliloquy is a sufficient Proof. He took occasion there, in a line or two, under the Name of his Printer, or (as he otherwise calls him) his Amanuensis, to prepare us for a more elaborate and methodical Piece which was to follow. We have this System now before us. Nor need we wonder, such as it is, that it came so hardly into the World, and that our Author has been deliver'd of it with so much difficulty, and after so long a time. His Amanuensis and he, were not, it seems, heretofore upon such good Terms of Correspondence. Otherwise such an unshapen Foetus, or false Birth, as that of which our Author in his Title-page complains, had not formerly appear'd abroad. Nor had it ever risen again in its more decent Form, but for the accidental Publication of our Author's First Letter, which, by a necessary Train of Consequences, occasion'd the revival of this abortive Piece, and gave usherance to its Companions.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It will appear therefore in this Joint-Edition of our Author's Five Treatises, that the Three former are preparatory to the Fourth, on which we are now enter'd; and the Fifth (with which he concludes) a kind of Apology for this reviv'd Treatise concerning Virtue and Religion.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for his Apology (particularly in what relates to reveal'd Religion, and a World to come) I commit the Reader to the disputant Divines, and Gentlemen, whom our Author has introduc'd in that concluding Piece of Dialogue-Writing, or rhapsodical Philosophy.

For the Ego or I, being establish'd in the first part of the Proposition, the Ergo, no doubt, must hold it good in the latter.

From whence it must follow, That the Affection towards it, as suppos'd Good, is an ill Affection, and creative only of Disturbance and Disease. So that the Affections of Love and Hatred, Liking and Dislike, on which the Happiness or Prosperity of the Person so much depends, being influenc'd and govern'd by Opinion; the highest Good or Happiness must depend on right Opinion, and the highest Misery be deriv'd from wrong.","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To explain this, I consider, for instance, the Fancy or Imagination I have of Death, according as I find this Subject naturally passing in my Mind.

Now if the Increase of the Aversion can be no Cause of the Decrease or Diminution of the Evil it-self, but rather the contrary; then the Increase of the Aversion must necessarily prove the Increase of Disappointment and Disturbance. And so on the other hand, the Diminution or Decrease of the Aversion (if this may any way be effected) must of necessity prove the Diminution of inward Disturbance, and the better Establishment of inward Quiet and Satisfaction.","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Again, I consider with my-self, That I have the Imagination of something beautiful, great, and becoming in Things.

Now if the Passion rais'd on this Opinion (call it Avarice, Pride, Vanity, or Ambition) be indeed incapable of any real Satisfaction, even under the most successful Course of Fortune; and then too, attended with perpetual Fears of Disappointment and Loss: how can the Mind be other than miserable, when possess'd by it? But if instead of forming thus the Opinion of Good; if instead of placing Worth or Excellence in these outward Subjects, we place it, where it is truest, in the Affections or Sentiments, in the governing Part and inward Character; we have then the full Enjoyment of it within our power: The Imagination or Opinion remains steddy and irreversible: And the Love, Desire and Appetite is answer'd; without Apprehension of Loss or Disappointment.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here therefore arises Work and Employment for us Within: \"To regulate Fancy, and rectify Opinion, on which all depends.\" For if our Loves, Desires, Hatreds and Aversions are left to themselves; we are necessarily expos'd to endless Vexation and Calamity: but if these are found capable of Amendment, or in any measure flexible or variable by Opinion; we ought, methinks, to make trial, at least, how far we might by this means acquire Felicity and Content.","subId":"22","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Accordingly, if we find it evident, on one hand, that by indulging any wrong Appetite (as either Debauch, Malice, or Revenge) the Opinion of the false Good increases; and the Appetite, which is a real Ill, grows so much the stronger: we may be as fully assur'd, on the other hand, that by restraining this Affection, and nourishing a contrary sort in opposition to it; we cannot fail to diminish what is Ill, and increase what is properly our Happiness and Good.","subId":"23","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.4.1.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On this account, a Man may reasonably conclude, \"That it becomes him, by working upon his own Mind, to withdraw the Fancy or Opinion of Good or Ill from that to which justly and by necessity it is not join'd; and apply it, with the strongest Resolution, to that with which it naturally agrees.\" For if the Fancy or Opinion of Good be join'd to what is not durable, nor in my power either to acquire or to retain; the more such an Opinion prevails, the more I must be subject to Disappointment and Distress.

'Tis plain, from what has been debated, That the less fanciful I am, in what relates to my Content and Happiness, the more powerful and absolute I must be, in Self-enjoyment, and the Possession of my Good. And since 'tis Fancy merely, which gives the force of Good, or power of passing as such, to Things of Chance and outward Dependency; 'tis evident, that the more I take from Fancy in this respect, the more I confer upon my-self. As I am less led or betray'd by Fancy to an Esteem of what depends on others; I am the more fix'd in the Esteem of what depends on myself alone.

Nor was this Prohibition of the wondering or admiring Habit, in early Students, peculiar to one kind of Philosophy alone. It was common to many; however the Reason and Account of it might differ, in one Sect from the other. The Pythagoreans sufficiently check'd their Tyro's, by silencing them so long on their first Courtship to Philosophy.
