We may find a thousand Engineers, who can sap, undermine, and blow up, with admirable Dexterity, for one single-one, who can build a Fort, or lay the Plat-form of a Citadel. And tho Compassion in real War may make the ruinous Practice less delightful, 'tis certain that in the literate warring-World, the springing of Mines, the blowing up of Towers, Bastions, and Ramparts of Philosophy, with Systems, Hypotheses, Opinions, and Doctrines into the Air, is a Spectacle of all other, the most naturally rejoicing.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Our Author, we suppose, might have done well to consider this.

It must be acknowledg'd, that tho, in the earliest times, there may have been divine Men of a transcending Genius, who have given Laws both in Religion and Government, to the great Advantage and Improvement of Mankind; yet Philosophy it-self, as a Science and known Profession worthy of that name, cannot with any probability be suppos'd to have risen (as our Author shews) till other Arts had been rais'd, and, in a certain proportion, advanc'd before it. As this was of the greatest Dignity and Weight, so it came last into Form. It was long clearing it-self from the affected Dress of Sophists, or Enthusiastick Air of Poets; and appear'd late in its genuine, simple, and just Beauty.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Reader perhaps may justly excuse our Author for having in this place so over-loaded his Margin with those weighty Authoritys and antient Citations, when he knows that there are many grave Professors in Humanity and Letters among the Moderns, who are puzzled in this Search, and write both repugnantly to one another, and to the plain and natural Evidence of the Case. The real Lineage and Succession of Wit, is indeed plainly founded in Nature: as our Author has endeavour'd to make appear both from History and Fact. The Greek Nation, as it is Original to us, in respect to these polite Arts and Sciences, so it was in reality original to it-self. For whether the Egyptians,Phenicians,Thracians, or Barbarians of any kind, may have hit fortunately on this or that particular Invention, either in Agriculture, Building, Navigation, or Letters; which-ever may have introduc'd this Rite of Worship, this Title of a Deity, this or that Instrument of Musick, this or that Festival, Game, or Dance, (for on this matter there are high Debates among the Learned) 'tis evident, beyond a doubt, that the Arts and Sciences were form'd in Greece it-self. 'Twas there that Musick, Poetry, and the rest came to receive some kind of shape, and be distinguish'd into their several Orders and Degrees. Whatever flourish'd, or was rais'd to any degree of Correctness, or real Perfection in the kind, was by means of Greece alone, and in the hand of that sole polite, most civiliz'd, and accomplish'd Nation.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor can this appear strange, when we consider the fortunate Constitution of that People. For tho compos'd of different Nations, distinct in Laws and Governments, divided by Seas and Continents, dispers'd in distant Islands; yet being originally of the same Extract, united by one single Language, and animated by that social, publick and free Spirit, which notwithstanding the Animosity of their several warring States, induc'd them to erect such heroick Congresses and Powers as those which constituted the Amphictonian Councils, the Olympick,Isthmian, and other Games; they cou'd not but naturally polish and refine each other. 'Twas thus they brought their beautiful and comprehensive Language to a just Standard, leaving only such Variety in the Dialects as render'd their Poetry, in particular, so much the more agreeable. The Standard was in the same proportion carry'd into other Arts. The Secretion was made. The several Species found, and set apart. The Performers and Masters in every kind, honour'd and admir'd. And, last of all, even Criticks themselves acknowledg'd and receiv'd as Masters over all the rest. From Musick, Poetry, Rhetorick, down to the simple Prose of History, thro' all the plastick Arts of Sculpture, Statuary, Painting, Architecture, and the rest; every thing Muse-like, graceful and exquisite, was rewarded with the highest Honours, and carry'd on with the utmost Ardor and Emulation. Thus Greece, tho she exported Arts to other Nations, had properly for her own share no Import of the kind. The utmost which cou'd be nam'd, wou'd amount to no more than raw Materials, of a rude and barbarous form. And thus the Nation was evidently Original in Art; and with them every noble Study and Science was (as the great Master, so often cited by our Author, says of certain kinds of Poetry) self-form'd, wrought out of Nature, and drawn from the necessary Operation and Course of things, working, as it were, of their own accord, and proper inclination. Now according to this natural Growth of Arts, peculiar to Greece, it wou'd necessarily happen; That at the beginning, when the Force of Language came to be first prov'd; when the admiring World made their first Judgment, and essay'd their Taste in the Elegancys of this sort; the Lofty, the Sublime, the Astonishing and Amazing wou'd be the most in fashion, and prefer'd. Metaphorical Speech, Multiplicity of Figures and high-sounding Words wou'd naturally prevail. Tho in the Common-wealth it-self, and in the Affairs of Government, Men were us'd originally to plain and direct Speech; yet when Speaking became an Art, and was taught by Sophists, and other pretended Masters, the high-poetick, and the figurative Way began to prevail, even at the Bar, and in the Publick Assemblys: Insomuch that the Grand-Master, in the above-cited part of his Rhetoricks, where he extols the Tragick Poet Euripides, upbraids the Rhetoricians of his own Age, who retain'd that very bombastick Style, which even Poets, and those too of the tragick kind, had already thrown off, or at least considerably mitigated. But the Taste of Greece was now polishing. A better Judgment was soon form'd, when a Demosthenes was heard, and had found success. The People themselves (as our Author has shewn) came now to reform their Comedy, and familiar Manner, after Tragedy, and the higher Style, had been brought to its perfection under the last hand of an Euripides. And now in all the principal Works of Ingenuity and Art, Simplicity and Nature began chiefly to be sought: And this was the Taste which lasted thro' so many Ages, till the Ruin of all things, under a Universal Monarchy.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the Reader shou'd peradventure be led by his Curiosity to seek some kind of Comparison between this antient Growth of Taste, and that which we have experienc'd in modern days, and within our own Nation; he may look back to the Speeches of our Ancestors in Parliament. He will find 'em generally speaking, to have been very short and plain, but coarse, and what we properly call home-spun; till Learning came in vogue, and Science was known amongst us. When our Princes and Senators became Scholars, they spoke scholastically. And the pedantick Style was prevalent, from the first Dawn of Letters, about the Age of the Reformation, till long afterwards. Witness the best written Discourses, the admir'd Speeches, Orations, or Sermons, thro' several Reigns, down to these latter, which we compute within the present Age. 'Twill undoubtedly be found, That till very late days, the Fashion of speaking, and the Turn of Wit, was after the figurative and florid Manner. Nothing was so acceptable as the high-sounding Phrase, the far-fetch'd Comparison, the capricious Point, and Play of Words; and nothing so despicable as what was merely of the plain or natural kind. So that it must either be confess'd, that in respect of the preceding Age, we are fallen very low in Taste; or that, if we are in reality improv'd, the natural and simple Manner which conceals and covers Art, is the most truly artful, and of the genteelest, truest, and best-study'd Taste: as has above been treated more at large.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"NOW, THEREFORE, as to our Author's Philosophy it-self, as it lies conceal'd in this Treatise, but more profess'd and formal in his next; we shall proceed gradually according to his own Method: since it becomes not one who has undertaken the part of his airy Assistant and humorous Paraphrast, to enter suddenly, without good preparation, into his dry Reasonings and moral Researches about the social Passions and natural Affections, of which he is such a punctilious Examiner.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of all human Affections, the noblest and most becoming human Nature, is that of Love to one's Country.

There are few such Country-men or Free-men so degenerate, as directly to discountenance or condemn this Passion of Love to their Community and national Brotherhood. The indirect Manner of opposing this Principle, is the most usual. We hear it commonly, as a Complaint, \"That there is little of this Love extant in the World.\" From whence 'tis hastily concluded, \"That there is little or nothing of friendly or social Affection inherent in our Nature, or proper to our Species.\" 'Tis however apparent, That there is scarce a Creature of human Kind, who is not possess'd at least with some inferior degree or meaner sort of this natural Affection to a Country.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Our own country charms and draws us with a certain sweetness.","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis a wretched Aspect of Humanity which we figure to our-selves, when we wou'd endeavour to resolve the very Essence and Foundation of this generous Passion into a Relation to mere Clay and Dust, exclusively of any thing sensible, intelligent, or moral. 'Tis, I must own, on certain Relations, or respective Proportions, that all natural Affection does in some measure depend. And in this View it cannot, I confess, be deny'd, that we have each of us a certain Relation to the mere Earth it-self, the very Mould or Surface of that Planet, in which, with other Animals of various sorts, We (poor Reptiles!) were also bred and nourish'd. But had it happen'd to one of us British-Men to have been born at Sea, cou'd we not therefore properly be call'd British-Men? Cou'd we be allow'd Country-Men of no sort, as having no distinct relation to any certain Soil or Region; no original Neighbourhood but with the watry Inhabitants and Sea-Monsters? Surely, if we were born of lawful Parents, lawfully employ'd, and under the Protection of Law; wherever they might be then detain'd, to whatever Colonys sent, or whither-soever driven by any Accident, or in Expeditions or Adventures in the Publick Service, or that of Mankind, we shou'd still find we had a Home, and Country, ready to lay claim to us. We shou'd be oblig'd still to consider our-selves as Fellow-Citizens, and might be allow'd to love our Country or Nation as honestly and heartily as the most inland Inhabitant or Native of the Soil. Our political and social Capacity wou'd undoubtedly come in view, and be acknowledg'd full as natural and essential in our Species, as the parental and filial kind, which gives rise to what we peculiarly call natural Affection. Or supposing that both our Birth and Parents had been unknown, and that in this respect we were in a manner younger Brothers in Society to the rest of Mankind; yet from our Nurture and Education we shou'd surely espouse some Country or other; and joyfully embracing the Protection of a Magistracy, shou'd of necessity and by force of Nature join our-selves to the general Society of Mankind, and those in particular, with whom we had enter'd into a nearer Communication of Benefits, and closer Sympathy of Affections.

'Tis admirable, indeed, to consider, That a Man shou'd have been long come into a World, carry'd his Reason and Sense about with him, and yet have never seriously ask'd himself this single Question, \"Where am I? or What? \" but, on the contrary, shou'd proceed regularly to every other Study and Inquiry, postponing this alone, as the least considerable; or leaving the Examination of it to others, commission'd, as he supposes, to understand and think for him, upon this Head. To be bubbled, or put upon by any sham-Advices in this Affair, is, it seems, of no consequence! We take care to examine accurately, by our own Judgment, the Affairs of other People, and the Concerns of the World which least belong to us: But what relates more immediately to our-selves, and is our chief Self -Interest, we charitably leave to others to examine for us, and readily take up with the first Comers; on whose Honesty and good Faith 'tis presum'd we may safely rely.","subId":"32","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.32"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here, methinks, the Ridicule turns more against the Philosophy-Haters than the Virtuosi or Philosophers. Whilst Philosophy is taken (as in its prime Sense it ought) for Mastership in Life and Manners, 'tis like to make no ill Figure in the World, whatever Impertinencys may reign, or however extravagant the Times may prove. But let us view Philosophy, like mere Virtuoso-ship, in its usual Career, and we shall find the Ridicule rising full as strongly against the Professors of the higher as the lower kind. Cockleshell abounds with each. Many things exterior, and without our-selves, of no relation to our real Interests or to those of Society and Mankind, are diligently investigated: Nature's remotest Operations, deepest Mysterys, and most difficult Phaenomena discuss'd, and whimsically explain'd; Hypotheses and fantastick Systems erected; a Universe anatomiz'd; and by some notable Scheme so solv'd and reduc'd, as to appear an easy Knack or Secret to those who have the Clew. Creation it-self can, upon occasion, be exhibited; Transmutations, Projections, and other Philosophical Arcana, such as in the corporeal World can accomplish all things; whilst in the intellectual, a set Frame of metaphysical Phrases and Distinctions can serve to solve whatever Difficultys may be propounded either in Logicks, Ethicks, or any real Science, of whatever kind.","subId":"33","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It appears from hence, that the Defects of Philosophy, and those of Virtuoso-ship are of the same nature.

Both Characters aim at what is excellent, aspire to a just Taste, and carry in view the Model of what is beautiful and becoming. Accordingly, the respective Conduct and distinct Manners of each Party are regulated; The one according to the perfectest Ease, and good Entertainment of Company; the other according to the strictest Interest of Mankind and Society: The one according to a Man's Rank and Quality in his private Nation; the other according to his Rank and Dignity in Nature.","subId":"36","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.36"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whether each of these Offices, of social Parts, are in themselves as convenient as becoming, is the great Question which must some-way be decided.

The Pretender to Philosophy, who either knows not how to determine this Affair, or if he has determin'd, knows not how to pursue his Point, with Constancy, and Firmness, remains in respect of Philosophy, what a Clown or Coxcomb is in respect of Breeding and Behaviour. Thus, according to our Author, the Taste of Beauty, and the Relish of what is decent, just, and amiable, perfects the Character of the Gentleman, and the Philosopher. And the Study of such a Taste or Relish will, as we suppose, be ever the great Employment and Concern of him, who covets as well to be wise and good, as agreeable and polite.","subId":"37","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.37"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I care about and I ask what is true and fitting and I am completely occupied in this.","subId":"38","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.3.1.38"},{"type":"note","content":"Viz.
