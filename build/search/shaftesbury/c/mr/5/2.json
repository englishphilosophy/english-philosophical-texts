There is, I know, a certain Species of Authors, who subsist wholly by the criticizing or commenting Practice upon others, and can appear in no other Form besides what this Employment authorizes them to assume. They have no original Character, or first Part; but wait for something which may be call'd a Work, in order to graft upon it, and come in, for Sharers, at second hand.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Pen-men of this Capacity and Degree are, from their Function and Employment, distinguish'd by the Title of Answerers.

And tho the new practising Criticks are of a sort unlikely ever to understand any original Book or Writing; they can understand, or at least remember, and quote the subsequent Reflections, Flouts, and Jeers, which may accidentally be made on such a Piece. Where-ever a Gentleman of this sort happens, at any time, to be in company, you shall no sooner hear a new Book spoken of, than 'twill be ask'd, \"Who has answer'd it?\" or \"When is there an Answer to come out?\"—Now the Answer, as our Gentleman knows, must needs be newer than the Book. And the newer a thing is, the more fashionable still, and the genteeler the Subject of Discourse. For this the Bookseller knows how to fit our Gentleman to a nicety: For he has commonly an Answer ready bespoke, and perhaps finish'd, by the time his new Book comes abroad.

For this reason, tho there are many Answerers seen abroad, there are few or no Criticks or Satirists. But whatever may be the State of Controversy in our Religion, or politick Concerns; 'tis certain that in the mere literate World, Affairs are manag'd with a better Understanding between the principal Partys concern'd.

They have found a way, by decrying all Criticism in general, to get rid of their Dissenters, and prevent all Pretences to further Reformation in their State.

It wou'd be unreasonable to expect of 'em that they shou'd bring such Measures in use, as being apply'd to their Works, wou'd discover 'em to be wholly deform'd and disproportionable. 'Tis no wonder therefore if we have so little of this critical Genius extant, to guide us in our Taste. 'Tis no wonder if what is generally current in this kind, lies in a manner bury'd, and in disguise under Burlesque, as particularly in the witty Comedy of a noble Author of this last Age. To the Shame, however, of our profess'd Wits and Enterprizers in the higher Spheres of Poetry, it may be observ'd, that they have not wanted good Advice and Instruction of the graver kind, from as high a Hand in respect of Quality and Character: Since one of the justest of our modern Poems, and so confess'd even by our Poets themselves, is a short Criticism, An Art of Poetry; by which, if they themselves were to be judg'd, they must in general appear no better than mere Bunglers, and void of all true Sense and Knowledg in their Art. But if in reality both Critick and Poet, confessing the Justice of these Rules of Art, can afterwards, in Practice, condemn and approve, perform and judg, in a quite different manner from what they acknowledg just and true: it plainly shews, That, tho perhaps we are not indigent in Wit; we want what is of more consequence, and can alone raise Wit to any Dignity or Worth; even plain Honesty,Manners, and a Sense of that MoralTruth, on which (as has been often express'd in these Volumes) poetick Truth and Beauty must naturally depend.","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The man who has learned what are his duties to his fatherland or to his friends; what affection is due to a father, a brother, or a guest; what is the duty of a senator, what of a juryman, . . . he to be sure knows how to find suitable language for each character.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for this Species of Morality which distinguishes the Civil Offices of Life, and describes each becoming Personage or Character in this Scene; so necessary it is for the Poet and polite Author to be appriz'd of it, that even the Divine himself may with juster pretence be exempted from the knowledg of this sort. The Composer of religious Discourses has the advantage of that higher Scene of Mystery, which is above the level of human Commerce. 'Tis not so much his Concern, or Business, to be agreeable.

His Theater, and that of the polite World, are very different: Insomuch that in a Reverend Author, or Declaimer of this sort, we naturally excuse the Ignorance of ordinary Decorum, in what relates to the Affairs of our inferior temporal World.

Here our Author's Timorousness is visible. In the very Plan or Model of his Work, he is apparently put to a hard shift, to contrive how or with what probability he might introduce Men of any Note or Fashion, reasoning expresly and purposely, without play or trifling, for two or three hours together, on mere Philosophy and Morals. He finds these Subjects (as he confesses) so wide of common Conversation, and, by long Custom, so appropriated to the School, the University-Chair, or Pulpit, that he thinks it hardly safe or practicable to treat of them elsewhere, or in a different Tone. He is forc'd therefore to raise particular Machines, and constrain his principal Characters, in order to carry a better Face, and bear himself out, against the appearance of Pedantry. Thus his Gentleman-Philosopher Theocles, before he enters into his real Character, becomes a feign'd Preacher. And even when his real Character comes on, he hardly dares stand it out; but to deal the better with his Sceptick-Friend, he falls again to personating, and takes up the Humour of the Poet and Enthusiast. Palemon the Man of Quality, and who is first introduc'd as Speaker in the Piece, must, for fashion-sake, appear in Love, and under a kind of Melancholy, produc'd by some Mis-adventures in the World. How else shou'd he be suppos'd so serious? Philocles his Friend (an airy Gentleman of the World, and a thorow Raillier) must have a home Charge upon him, and feel the Anger of his grave Friend, before he can be suppos'd grave enough to enter into a philosophical Discourse. A quarter of an hour's reading must serve to represent an hour or two's Debate.

I know not whether they wou'd do so much for any philosophical Piece in the world. Our Author seems very much to question it; and has therefore made that part easy enough, which relates to the distinction of his Characters, by making use of the narrative Manner. Tho he had done, as well, perhaps, not to have gone out of the natural plain way, on this account. For with those to whom such philosophical Subjects are agreeable, it cou'd be thought no laborious Task to give the same attention to Characters in Dialogue, as is given at the first entrance by every Reader to the easiest Play, compos'd of fewest and plainest Personages.

For if real Gentlemen, seduc'd, as you pretend, and made erroneous in their Religion or Philosophy, discover not the least Feature of their real Faces in your Looking-glass, nor know themselves, in the least, by your Description; they will hardly be apt to think they are refuted. How wittily soever your Comedy may be wrought up, they will scarce apprehend any of that Wit to fall upon themselves. They may laugh indeed at the Diversion you are pleas'd to give 'em: But the Laugh perhaps may be different from what you intend. They may smile secretly to see themselves thus encounter'd; when they find, at last, your Authority laid by, and your scholastick Weapons quitted, in favour of this weak Attempt, To master them by their own Arms, and proper Ability.\"","subId":"33","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THUS WE have perform'd our critical Task, and try'd our Strength, both on our Author, and those of his Order, who attempt to write in Dialogue, after the active dramatick, mimical, or personating Way; according to which a Writer is properly poetical.","subId":"34","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.34"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What remains, we shall examine in our succeeding and last Chapter.","subId":"35","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.35"},{"type":"note","content":"Viz.

But aetatem habet, de se loquatur. Others, that the double Poison is unnatural. Let the common receiv'd Opinion, and Ausonius's famous Epigram answer that. Lastly, a more ignorant sort of Creatures than either of the former, maintain that the Character of Dorax is not only unnatural, but inconsistent with it-self. Let them read the Play, and think again.—A longer Reply is what those Cavillers deserve not. But I will give them and their Fellows to understand, that the Earl of * * * was pleas'd to read the Tragedy twice over before it was acted, and did me the favour to send me word, that I had written beyond any of my former Plays, and that he was displeas'd any thing shou'd be cut away. If I have not reason to prefer his single Judgment to a whole Faction, let the World be judge: For the Opposition is the same with that of Lucan' s Hero against an Army, concurrere Bellum atque Virum.

'Tis a Sceptick recites: and the Hero of the Piece passes for an Enthusiast. If a perfect Character be wanting; 'tis the same Case here, as with the Poets in some of their best Pieces. And this surely is a sufficient Warrant for the Author of a PHILOSOPHICAL ROMANCE.\"—Thus our Author himself; who to conceal, however, his strict Imitation of the antient poetick DIALOGUE, has prefix'd an auxiliary Title to his Work, and given it the Sirname of RHAPSODY: As if it were merely of that Essay or mix'd kind of Works, which come abroad with an affected Air of Negligence and Irregularity. But whatever our Author may have affected in his Title-Page, 'twas so little his Intention to write after that Model of incoherent Workmanship, that it appears to be sorely against his Will, if this Dialogue-Piece of his has not the just Character, and correct Form of those antient Poems describ'd. He wou'd gladly have constituted ONE single Action and Time, sutable to the just Simplicity of those Dramatick Works. And this, one wou'd think, was easy enough for him to have done. He needed only to have brought his first Speakers immediately into Action, and sav'd the narrative or recitative Part of Philocles to Palemon, by producing them as speaking Personages upon his Stage. The Scene all along might have been the Park. From the early Evening to the late Hour of Night, that the two Galants withdrew to their Town-Apartments, there was sufficient time for the Narrator Philocles, to have recited the whole Transaction of the second and third Part; which wou'd have stood thro'out as it now does: only at the Conclusion, when the narrative or recitative Part had ceas'd, the simple and direct DIALOGUE wou'd have again return'd, to grace the Exit. By this means the temporal as well as local Unity of the Piece had been preserv'd. Nor had our Author been necessitated to commit that Anachronism, of making his first Part, in order, to be last in time.","subId":"n12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.5.2.n12"},{"type":"note","content":"VOL.
