How far the Author of the Letter differs from this Author in his Opinion both of the End and Foundation of this Passion, may appear from what has been said above.

Many of these, he observes, are at this day pretendedly exhibited in the World, with an Endeavour of giving them the perfect Air and exact Resemblance of those recorded in Holy Writ. He speaks indeed with Contempt of the Mockery of modern Miracles and Inspiration. And as to all Pretences to things of this kind in our present Age; he seems inclin'd to look upon 'em as no better than mere Imposture or Delusion. But for what is recorded of Ages heretofore, he seems to resign his Judgment, with intire Condescension, to his Superiors. He pretends not to frame any certain or positive Opinion of his own, notwithstanding his best Searches into Antiquity, and the Nature of religious Record and Tradition: but on all occasions submits most willingly, and with full Confidence and Trust, to the Opinions by Law establish'd.

Between these two States or Situations of Mind, there can be no medium. For he who says, \"That he believes for certain, or is assur'd of what he believes\"; either speaks ridiculously, or says in effect, \"That he believes strongly, but is not sure.\" So that whoever is not conscious of Revelation, nor has certain Knowledg of any Miracle or Sign, can be no more than Sceptick in the Case: And the best Christian in the World, who being destitute of the means of Certainty, depends only on History and Tradition for his Belief in these Particulars, is at best but a Sceptick-Christian.

His Faith is not in antient Facts or Persons, nor in the antient Writ, or Primitive Recorders; nor in the successive Collators or Conservators of these Records (for of these he is unable to take cognizance): But his Confidence and Trust must be in those modern Men, or Societys of Men, to whom the Publick, or He himself, ascribes the Right to judg of these Records, and commits the Determination of sacred Writ and genuine Story.","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let the Person seem ever so positive or dogmatical in these high Points of Learning; he is yet in reality no Dogmatist, nor can any way free himself from a certain kind of Scepticism.

So far are we from being able to be sure when we have a mind; that indeed we can never be thorowly sure, but then only when we can't help it, and find of necessity we must be so, whether we will or not.

In his account of some Transactions of this kind, himself being the Witness, and speaking (as we may presume) of his own Person, and proper Vision, he says only that \"He knew a Man: whether in the Body or out of it, he cannot tell. But such a one caught up to the third Heaven, he knew formerly (he says) above fourteen years before his then Writing.\" And when in another Capacity the same inspir'd Writer, giving Precepts to his Disciples, distinguishes what he writes by Divine Commission from what he delivers as his own Judgment and private Opinion, he condescends nevertheless to speak as one no way positive, or Master of any absolute Criterion in the Case. And in several subsequent Passages, he expresses himself as under some kind of Doubt how to judg or determine certainly, \"Whether he writes by Inspiration or otherwise.\" He only \"thinks he has the Spirit.\" He \"is not sure,\" nor wou'd have us to depend on him as positive or certain in a matter of so nice Discernment.","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The holy Founders and inspir'd Authors of our Religion requir'd not, it seems, so strict an Assent, or such implicit Faith in behalf of their original Writings and Revelations, as later un-inspir'd Doctors, without the help of Divine Testimony, or any Miracle on their side, have requir'd in behalf of their own Comments and Interpretations. The earliest and worst of Hereticks, 'tis said, were those call'd Gnosticks, who took their name from an audacious Pretence to certain Knowledg and Comprehension of the greatest Mysterys of Faith.

'Twas Satisfaction enough to the Priest-Philosopher, if the initiated Party preserv'd his Respect and Veneration for the Tradition and Worship of the Temple, by complying in every respect with the requisite Performances and Rites of Worship. No Account was afterwards taken of the Philosophick Faith of the Proselyte, or Worshiper. His Opinions were left to himself, and he might philosophize according to what foreign School or Sect he fansy'd.

The odd exterior Shapes of Deitys, Temples, and holy Utensils, which by the Egyptian Sects had been formerly set in battel against each other, were now metamorphos'd into philosophical Forms and Phantoms; and, like Flags and Banners, display'd in hostile manner, and borne offensively, by one Party against another. In former times those barbarous Nations above mention'd were the sole Warriors in these religious Causes; but now the whole World became engag'd: when instead of Storks and Crocodiles, other Ensigns were erected; when sophistical Chimeras, crabbed Notions, bombastick Phrases, Solecisms, Absurditys, and a thousand Monsters of a scholastick Brood, were set on foot, and made the Subject of vulgar Animosity and Dispute.","subId":"24","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here first began that Spirit of Bigotry, which broke out in a more raging manner than had been ever known before, and was less capable of Temper or Moderation than any Species, Form, or Mixture of Religion in the antient World.

The very Jewish Traditions, and Cabalistick Learning underwent this Fate. That which was naturally the Subject of profound Speculation and Inquiry, was made the necessary Subject of a strict and absolute Assent. The allegorical, mythological Account of Sacred Things, was wholly inverted: Liberty of Judgment and Exposition taken away: No Ground left for Inquiry, Search, or Meditation: No Refuge from the dogmatical Spirit let loose.

As little Bigots as the People were, and as far from any offensive Zeal, yet when their establish'd Church came to be call'd in question, we see in what a manner their Zeal began to operate. \"All with one voice, about the space of two hours, cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\" At the same time this Assembly was so confus'd, that the greater part knew not wherefore they were come together; and consequently cou'd not understand why their Church was in any Danger. But the Enthusiasm was got up, and a Panick Fear for the Church had struck the Multitude.

Ye know that by this Mystery, or Craft, we have our Wealth. Ye see withal, and have heard, that not only here at Ephesus, but almost thro'out all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turn'd away many People, by telling them, They are no real Gods who are figur'd, or wrought with hands: so that not only this our Craft is in danger; but also the Temple it-self.\"","subId":"29","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nothing cou'd be more moderate and wise, nothing more agreeable to that magisterial Science or Policy, which our Author recommends, than the Behaviour of the Town-Clerk or Recorder of the City, as he is represented on this occasion, in Holy Writ.

He ventur'd to assure the People, \"That every one acquiesc'd in their antient Worship of the great Goddess, and in their Tradition of the Image, which fell down from Jupiter: That these were Facts undeniable: and That the new Sect neither meant the pulling down of their Church, nor so much as offer'd to blaspheme or speak amiss of their Goddess.\"","subId":"30","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.30"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This, no doubt, was stretching the point sufficiently; as may be understood by the Event, in after time.

Mean while the Tumult was appeas'd: No harm befel the Temple for that time. The new Sect acquiesc'd in what had been spoken on their behalf. They allow'd the Apology of the Recorder.

All these seeming Contrarietys of human Passion they knew how to comprehend in their political Model and subservient System of Divinity.

'Tis indeed the Nature of Fear, as of all other Passions, when excessive, to defeat its own End, and prevent us in the execution of what we naturally propose to our-selves as our Advantage. Superstition it-self is but a certain kind of Fear, which possessing us strongly with the apprehended Wrath or Displeasure of Divine Powers, hinders us from judging what those Powers are in themselves, or what Conduct of ours may, with best reason, be thought sutable to such highly rational and superior Natures. Now if from the Experience of many gross Delusions of a superstitious kind, the Course of this Fear begins to turn; 'tis natural for it to run, with equal violence, a contrary way. The extreme Passion for religious Objects passes into an Aversion. And a certain Horror and Dread of Imposture causes as great a Disturbance as even Imposture it-self had done before. In such a Situation as this, the Mind may easily be blinded; as well in one respect, as in the other. 'Tis plain, both these Disorders carry something with them which discover us to be in some manner beside our Reason, and out of the right use of Judgment and Understanding. For how can we be said to intrust or use our Reason, if in any case we fear to be convinc'd? How are we Masters of our-selves, when we have acquir'd the Habit of bringing Horror, Aversion, Favour, Fondness, or any other Temper than that of mere Indifference and Impartiality, into the Judgment of Opinions, and Search of Truth?","subId":"n3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n3"},{"type":"note","content":"Dr. More, §. 11, 19, 20, and so on.","subId":"n4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n4"},{"type":"note","content":"§. 16.","subId":"n5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n5"},{"type":"note","content":"It appears from hence, that in the Notion which this learned Divine gives us of Enthusiasm, he comprehends the social or popular Genius of the Passion; agreeably with what our Author in his Letter concerning Enthusiasm (p. 15, 16, 44, 45.) has said of the Influence and Power of the Assembly and Auditory it-self, and of the communicative Force and rapid Progress of this extatick Fervor, once kindled, and set in action.","subId":"n6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n6"},{"type":"note","content":"§. 20, 21, 23, 26.","subId":"n7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n7"},{"type":"note","content":"Acts ii. 13.","subId":"n8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n8"},{"type":"note","content":"§. 1.","subId":"n9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n9"},{"type":"note","content":"§. 15.","subId":"n10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n10"},{"type":"note","content":"§. 30, & 57.","subId":"n11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.2.n11"},{"type":"note","content":"VOL.

But what may give us yet a greater Idea of these Riches, is, That in the latter Heathen Times, which grew more and more superstitious, the restraining Laws (or Statues of Mort-main) by which Men had formerly been with-held from giving away Estates by Will, or otherwise, to Religious Uses, were repeal'd; and the Heathen-Church left, in this manner, as a bottomless Gulph and devouring Receptacle of Land and Treasure.

What the Zeal was of many early Christians against the Idolatry of the old Heathen Church (at that time the establish'd one) may be comprehended by any Person who is ever so slenderly vers'd in the History of those Times. Nor can it be said indeed of us Moderns, that in the quality of good Christians (as that Character is generally understood) we are found either backward or scrupulous in assigning to Perdition such Wretches as we pronounce guilty of Idolatry. The name Idolater is sufficient Excuse for almost any kind of Insult against the Person, and much more against the Worship of such a Mis-Believer. The very word Christian is in common Language us'd for Man, in opposition to Brute-Beast, without leaving so much as a middle place for the poor Heathen or Pagan: who, as the greater Beast of the two, is naturally doom'd to Massacre, and his Gods and Temples to Fracture and Demolishment. Nor are we masters of this Passion, even in our best humour. The French Poets, we see, can with great Success, and general Applause, exhibit this primitive Zeal even on the publick Stage: [Polyeucte, Act II. Sc. 6.] \n\nNe perdons plus de temps, le Sacrifice est prêt. \n Allons y du vray Dieu soutenir l'intérêt, \n Allons fouler aux piés ce Foudre ridicule \n Dont arme un bois pourri ce Peuple trop credule; \n Allons en éclairer l'aveuglement fatal, \n Allons briser ces Dieux de Pierre & de Metau: \n Abandonnons nos jours à cette ardeur celeste, \n Faisons triompher Dieu; qu'il dispose du reste.\n\n I shou'd scarce have mention'd this, but that it came into my mind how ill a Construction some People have endeavour'd to make of what our Author, stating the Case of Heathen and Christian Persecution, in his Letter of Enthusiasm, has said concerning the Emperor Julian. It was no more indeed than had been said of that virtuous and gallant Emperor by his greatest Enemys; even by those who, to the shame of Christianity, boasted of his having been most insolently affronted on all occasions, and even treacherously assassinated by one of his Christian Soldiers. As for such Authors as these, shou'd I cite them in their proper invective Style and Saint-like Phrase, they wou'd make no very agreeable appearance, especially in Miscellanys of the kind we have here undertaken. But a Letter of that elegant and witty Emperor, may not be improperly plac'd amongst our Citations, as a Pattern of his Humour and Genius, as well as of his Principle and Sentiments, on this occasion. [Julian's Epistles, Numb. 52.] \n\nJulian to the Bostrens. \n \"I should have thought, indeed, that the Galilaean Leaders wou'd have esteem'd themselves more indebted to me, than to him who preceded me in the Administration of the Empire. For in his time, many of them suffer'd Exile, Persecution, and Imprisonment. Multitudes of those whom in their Religion they term Hereticks, were put to the sword. Insomuch that in Samosata, Cyzicum, Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Galatia, and many other Countrys, whole Towns were level'd with the Earth. The just Reverse of this has been observ'd in my time. The Exiles have been recall'd; and the Proscrib'd restor'd to the lawful Possession of their Estates. But to that height of Fury and Distraction are this People arriv'd, that being no longer allow'd the Privilege to tyrannize over one another, or persecute either their own Sectarys, or the Religious of the lawful Church, they swell with rage, and leave no stone unturn'd, no opportunity unimploy'd, of raising Tumult and Sedition. So little regard have they to true Piety; so little Obedience to our Laws and Constitutions; however humane and tolerating. For still do we determine and steddily resolve, never to suffer one of them to be drawn involuntarily to our Altars. * * * As for the mere People, indeed, they appear driven to these Riots and Seditions by those amongst them whom they call CLERICKS: who are now enrag'd to find themselves restrain'd in the use of their former Power and intemperate Rule. * * * They can no longer act the Magistrate or Civil Judg, nor assume Authority to make Peoples Wills, supplant Relations, possess themselves of other Mens Patrimonys, and by specious Pretences transfer all into their own possession. * * * For this reason I have thought fit, by this Publick EDICT, to forewarn the People of this sort, that they raise no more Commotions, nor gather in a riotous manner about their seditious CLERICKS, in defiance of the Magistrate, who has been insulted and in danger of being ston'd by these incited Rabbles. In their Congregations they may, notwithstanding, assemble as they please, and croud about their Leaders, performing Worship, receiving Doctrine, and praying, according as they are by them taught and conducted: But if with any Tendency to Sedition; let them beware how they hearken, or give assent; and remember, 'tis at their peril, if by these means they are secretly wrought up to Mutiny and Insurrection. * * * Live, therefore, in Peace and Quietness! neither spitefully opposing, or injuriously treating one another. You misguided People of the new way, Beware, on your side! And you of the antient and establish'd Church, injure not your Neighbours and Fellow-Citizens, who are enthusiastically led away, in Ignorance and Mistake, rather than with Design or Malice! 'Tis by DISCOURSE and REASON, not by Blows, Insults, or Violence, that Men are to be inform'd of Truth, and convinc'd of Error. Again therefore and again I enjoin and charge the zealous Followers of the true Religion, no way to injure, molest, or affront the Galilaean People.\n\n\" Thus the generous and mild Emperor; whom we may indeed call Heathen, but not so justly Apostate: since being, at different times of his Youth, transfer'd to different Schools or Universitys, and bred under Tutors of each Religion, as well Heathen as Christian; he happen'd, when of full age, to make his choice (tho very unfortunately) in the former kind, and adher'd to the antient Religion of his Country and Forefathers.
