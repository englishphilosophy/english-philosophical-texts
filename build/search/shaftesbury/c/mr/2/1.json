Some there are who assert the Negative, and endeavour to solve the Appearances of this kind by the natural Operation of our Passions, and the common Course of outward Things. For my own part, I cannot but at this present apprehend a kind of Enchantment or Magick in that which we call Enthusiasm; since I find, that having touch'd slightly on this Subject, I cannot so easily part with it at pleasure.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"After having made some cursory Reflections on our Author's Letter, I thought I might have sufficiently acquitted my-self on this head; till passing to his next Treatise, I found my-self still further ingag'd. I perceiv'd plainly that I had as yet scarce enter'd into our Author's Humour, or felt any thing of that Passion, which, as he informs us, is so easily communicable and naturally engaging. But what I had pass'd over in my first Reflections, I found naturally rising in me, upon second thoughts. So that by experience I prov'd it true what our Author says, \"That we all of us know something of this Principle.\" And now that I find I have in reality so much of it imparted to me, I may with better reason be pardon'd, if, after our Author's example, I am led to write on such Subjects as these, with Caution, at different Reprises; and not singly, in one Breath.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have heard indeed that the very reading of Treatises and Accounts of Melancholy, has been apt to generate that Passion in the over-diligent and attentive Reader. And this perhaps may have been the reason, why our Author himself (as he seems to intimate towards the Conclusion of his first Letter) car'd not in reality to grapple closely with his Subject, or give us, at once, the precise Definition of Enthusiasm. This however we may, with our Author, presume to infer, from the coolest of all Studys, even from Criticism it-self, (of which we have been lately treating) \"That there is a Power in Numbers, Harmony, Proportion, and Beauty of every kind, which naturally captivates the Heart, and raises the Imagination to an Opinion or Conceit of something majestick and divine.\"","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whatever this Subject may be in it-self; we cannot help being transported with the thought of it. It inspires us with something more than ordinary, and raises us above our-selves. Without this Imagination or Conceit, the World wou'd be but a dull Circumstance, and Life a sorry Pass-time. Scarce cou'd we be said to live. The animal Functions might in their course be carry'd on; but nothing further sought for, or regarded. The gallant Sentiments, the elegant Fancys, the Belle-passions, which have, all of them, this Beauty in view, wou'd be set aside, and leave us probably no other Employment than that of satisfying our coarsest Appetites at the cheapest rate; in order to the attainment of a supine State of Indolence and Inactivity.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Slender wou'd be the Enjoyments of the Lover, the ambitious Man, the Warrior, or the Virtuoso, (as our Author has elsewhere intimated) if in the Beautys which they admire, and passionately pursue, there were no reference or regard to any higher Majesty or Grandure, than what simply results from the particular Objects of their pursuit. I know not, in reality, what we shou'd do to find a seasoning to most of our Pleasures in Life, were it not for the Taste or Relish, which is owing to this particular Passion, and the Conceit or Imagination which supports it. Without this, we cou'd not so much as admire a Poem, or a Picture; a Garden, or a Palace; a charming Shape, or a fair Face. Love it-self wou'd appear the lowest thing in Nature, when thus anticipated, and treated according to the Anti-enthusiastick Poet's method:","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And to indulge lust with whoever is at hand.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How Heroism or Magnanimity must stand in this Hypothesis, is easy to imagine. The Muses themselves must make a very indifferent figure in this philosophical Draught. Even the Prince of Poets wou'd prove a most insipid Writer, if he were thus reduc'd. Nor cou'd there, according to this Scheme, be yet a place of Honour left even for our Latin Poet, the great Disciple of this un-polite Philosophy, who dares with so little Equity employ the Muses Art in favour of such a System. But in spite of his Philosophy, he everywhere gives way to Admiration, and rapturous Views of Nature. He is transported with the several Beautys of the World, even whilst he arraigns the Order of it, and destroys the Principle of Beauty, from whence in antient Languages the World it-self was nam'd.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This is what our Author advances; when in behalf of Enthusiasm he quotes its formal Enemys, and shews That they are as capable of it as its greatest Confessors and Assertors. So far is he from degrading Enthusiasm, or disclaiming it in himself; that he looks on this Passion, simply consider'd, as the most natural, and its Object as the justest in the World.

The exalted part of Love is only borrow'd hence. That of pure Friendship is its immediate Self. He who yields his Life a Sacrifice to his Prince or Country; the Lover who for his Paramour performs as much; the heroick, the amorous, the religious Martyrs, who draw their Views, whether visionary or real, from this Pattern and Exemplar of Divinity: all these, according to our Author's Sentiment, are alike actuated by this Passion, and prove themselves in effect so many different Enthusiasts.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor is thorow Honesty, in his Hypothesis, any other than this Zeal, or Passion, moving strongly upon the Species or View of the Decorum, and Sublime of Actions.

According to the Regimen prescrib'd by this Philosophy, it must be acknowledg'd that the Evils of Love, Ambition, Vanity, Luxury, with other Disturbances deriv'd from the florid, high, and elegant Ideas of Things, must in appearance be set in a fair way of being radically cur'd.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It need not be thought surprizing, that Religion it-self shou'd in the account of these Philosophers be reckon'd among those Vices and Disturbances, which it concerns us after this manner to extirpate.

Now if the Subject it-self be not in Nature, neither the Idea nor the Passion grounded on it can be properly esteem'd natural: And thus all Admiration ceases; and Enthusiasm is at an end. But if there be naturally such a Passion; 'tis evident that Religion it-self is of the kind, and must be therefore natural to Man.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We can admire nothing profoundly, without a certain religious Veneration.

They knew very well that the first Motion, Appetite, and Ardour of the Youth in general towards Philosophy and Knowledg, depended chiefly on this Turn of Temper: Yet were they well appriz'd, withal, That in the Progress of this Study, as well as in the affairs of Life, the florid Ideas and exalted Fancy of this kind became the Fuel of many incendiary Passions; and that, in religious Concerns particularly, the Habit of Admiration and contemplative Delight, wou'd, by over-Indulgence, too easily mount into high Fanaticism, or degenerate into abject Superstition.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon the whole therefore, according to our Author, Enthusiasm is, in it-self, a very natural honest Passion; and has properly nothing for its Object but what is Good and Honest.

And by modern example we know, perhaps yet better than by any antient, that, in Religion, the Enthusiasm which works by Love, is subject to many strange Irregularitys; and that which works by Fear, to many monstrous and horrible Superstitions. Mysticks and Fanaticks are known to abound as well in our Reform'd, as in the Romish Churches. The pretended Floods of Grace pour'd into the Bosoms of the Quietists, Pietists, and those who favour the extatick way of Devotion, raise such Transports, as by their own Proselytes are confess'd to have something strangely agreeable, and in common with what ordinary Lovers are us'd to feel. And it has been remark'd by many, That the Female Saints have been the greatest Improvers of this soft part of Religion. What truth there may be in the related Operations of this pretended Grace and amorous Zeal, or in the Accounts of what has usually past between the Saints of each Sex, in these devout Extasys, I shall leave the Reader to examine: supposing he will find credible Accounts, sufficient to convince him of the dangerous progress of Enthusiasm in this amorous Lineage.","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There are many Branches indeed more vulgar, as that of Fear,Melancholy,Consternation,Suspicion,Despair. And when the Passion turns more towards the astonishing and frightful, than the amiable and delightful side, it creates rather what we call Superstition than Enthusiasm. I must confess withal, that what we commonly style Zeal in matters of Religion, is seldom without a mixture of both these Extravagancys. The extatick Motions of Love and Admiration, are seldom un-accompany'd with the Horrors and Consternations of a lower sort of Devotion. These Paroxysms of Zeal are in reality as the hot and cold Fits of an Ague, and depend on the different and occasional Views or Aspects of the Divinity; according as the Worshiper is guided from without, or affected from within, by his particular Constitution. Seldom are those Aspects so determinate and fix'd, as to excite constantly one and the same Spirit of Devotion. In Religions therefore, which hold most of Love, there is generally room left for Terrors of the deepest kind. Nor is there any Religion so diabolical, as, in its representation of Divinity, to leave no room for Admiration and Esteem. Whatever Personage or Specter of Divinity is worship'd; a certain Esteem and Love is generally affected by his Worshipers. Or if, in the Devotion paid him, there be in truth no real or absolute Esteem; there is however a certain astonishing Delight or Ravishment excited.","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Passion is experienc'd, in common, by every Worshiper of the Zealot-kind.

In this Disposition the Reins are let loose to all Passion which arises: And the Mind, as far as it is able to act or think in such a State, approves the Riot, and justifies the wild Effects, by the suppos'd Sacredness of the Cause. Every Dream and Frenzy is made Inspiration; every Affection, Zeal. And in this Persuasion the Zealots, no longer self-govern'd, but set adrift to the wide Sea of Passion, can in one and the same Spirit of Devotion, exert the opposite Passions of Love and Hatred; unite affectionately, and abhor furiously; curse, bless, sing, mourn, exult, tremble, caress, assassinate, inflict and suffer Martyrdom, with a thousand other the most vehement Efforts of variable and contrary Affection.","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THE common Heathen Religion, especially in its latter Age, when adorn'd with the most beautiful Temples, and render'd more illustrious by the Munificence of the Roman Senate and succeeding Emperors, ran wholly into Pomp, and was supported chiefly by that sort of Enthusiasm, which is rais'd from the external Objects of Grandure, Majesty, and what we call August. On the other side, the Egyptian or Syrian Religions, which lay more in Mystery and conceal'd Rites; having less Dependence on the Magistrate, and less of that Decorum of Art, Politeness, and Magnificence, ran into a more pusillanimous, frivolous, and mean kind of Superstition; \"The Observation of Days, the Forbearance of Meats, and the Contention about Traditions, Seniority of Laws, and Priority of Godships.\"","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Hence a raging madness is abroad on both sides, because each place hates its neighbours' deities, since it believes that only its own objects of worship are Gods.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.MR.2.1.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"History, withal, informs us of a certain Establishment in Egypt, which was very extraordinary, and must needs have had a very uncommon effect; no way advantageous to that Nation in particular, or to the general Society of Mankind.

Now it happen'd of old, in this Mother-Land of Superstition, that the Sons of certain Artists were by Law oblig'd always to follow the same Calling with their Fathers. Thus the Son of a Priest was always a Priest by Birth, as was the whole Lineage after him, without interruption. Nor was it a Custom with this Nation, as with others, to have only one single Priest or Priestess to a Temple: but as the Number of Gods and Temples was infinite; so was that of the Priests.

[When the acceptance of the old-fashioned morals was prevailing with great strength to reconcile the minds of the Hebrews to the laws and sacrificial rites of God and was removing all the ill-will from the Mosaic reformation, it was especially appropriate that God received some rites customary in former times into the number of his own sacred rituals and that the law given by Moses carried some aspect of these assimilated practices. Certainly the Israelites had been so born and reared, having departed from Egypt only recently, that it was almost necessary to God (it is right to say humane) to indulge them in the practice of some of their former rituals and to adapt his laws to their habit and standard. For they were a people habituated from childhood to the customs of the Egyptians and confirmed in them by the practice of many years. . . . The Hebrews were accustomed not only to the manners of the Egyptians but also to their obstinacies. . . . Just as a people from whatever locale and country have their own distinct character and habits peculiar to them, so nature fashioned the race of the Hebrews in distinction from the rest of the inhabitants of the world in disposition: capricious, difficult and stubborn even to the point of disgrace. . . . Therefore since the old Hebrews had such harsh and savage manners, the character of the people demanded that God would allow them some rituals of long-standing usage and a lawful servitude happened to them due to their own weakness; (just as Theodorus says) he established the ritual law suited to their weaknesses. . . . The Hebrews were a race full of superstitions and were almost destitute of all writing. How deeply they were immersed in the superstitions of the race you may understand from the laws which were being imposed on the people as if they were antidotes for superstitions. Moreover stiff-necked superstition is a monster, especially if from blind ignorance it will have drunk in a new ferocity and obstinacy. In truth it can easily be believed that the Israelites recently freed from slavery were untutored in civilized arts and scarcely had a taste for anything beyond the bricks and garlic of the Egyptians. And so since now God had a duty to people so barbarous and so thoroughly dedicated to superstition it was almost necessary that he give something to the inconstancy of those weak men and would draw them to himself by a certain trick (not by arguments).
