For 'twas no longer the agreeable Part of a Companion which I had now to bear. Your Conversation, Palemon, which had hitherto supported me, was at an end. I was now alone; confin'd to my Closet; oblig'd to meditate by my-self; and reduc'd to the hard Circumstances of an Author, and Historian, in the most difficult Subject.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But here, methought, propitious Heaven, in some manner, assisted me. For if Dreams were, as Homer teaches, sent from the Throne of Jove; I might conclude I had a favourable one, of the true sort, towards the Morning-light; which, as I recollected my-self, gave me a clear and perfect Idea of what I desir'd so earnestly to bring back to my Memory.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I found my-self transported to a distant Country, which presented a pompous rural Scene. It was a Mountain not far from the Sea, its Brow adorn'd with antient Wood, and at its foot a River and well-inhabited Plain: beyond which the Sea appearing, clos'd the Prospect.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"No sooner had I consider'd the Place, than I discern'd it to be the very same where I had talk'd with Theocles the second Day I was with him in the Country. I look'd about to see if I cou'd find my Friend; and calling Theocles! I awak'd. But so powerful was the Impression of my Dream, and so perfect the Idea rais'd in me, of the Person, Words, and Manner of my Friend, that I cou'd now fansy myself philosophically inspir'd, as that Roman Sage by his AEgeria, and invited, on this occasion, to try my Historical Muse. For justly might I hope for such Assistance in behalf of Theocles, who so lov'd the Muses, and was, I thought, no less belov'd by them.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"TO RETURN therefore to that original rural Scene, and that Heroick Genius, the Companion and Guide of my first Thoughts in these profounder Subjects: I found him the first Morning with his belov'd Mantuan Muse, roving in the Fields; where, as I had been inform'd at his House, he was gone out, after his usual way, to read. The moment he saw me, his Book vanish'd, and he came with friendly haste to meet me. After we had embrac'd, I discover'd my Curiosity to know what he was reading; and ask'd, \"if it were of a secret kind, to which I cou'd not be admitted.\" On this he shew'd me his Poet; and looking pleasantly, \"Now tell me truly,\" said he, \"Philocles, did you not expect some more mysterious Book than this?\" I own'd I did, considering his Character, which I took to be of so contemplative a kind. \"And do you think,\" said he, \"that without being contemplative, one can truly relish these diviner Poets?\" \"Indeed,\" said I, \"I never thought there was any need of growing contemplative, or retiring from the World, to read Virgil or Horace. \"","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Retirement.} You have nam'd two, said he, who can hardly be thought so very like; tho they were Friends, and equally good Poets. Yet joining 'em, as you are pleas'd to do, I wou'd willingly learn from you, whether in your opinion there be any Disposition so fitted for reading 'em, as that in which they writ themselves. In this, I am sure, they both join'd heartily; to love Retirement: when for the sake of such a Life and Habit as you call contemplative, they were willing to sacrifice the highest Advantages, Pleasures, and Favour of a Court. But I will venture to say more in favour of Retirement: \"That not only the best Authors, but the best Company, require this seasoning.\" Society it-self cannot be rightly enjoy'd without some Abstinence and separate Thought. All grows insipid, dull, and tiresom, without the help of some Intervals of Retirement. Say, Philocles, whether you your-self have not often found it so? Do you think those Lovers understand the Interests of their Loves, who by their good-will wou'd never be parted for a moment? Or wou'd they be discreet Friends, think you, who wou'd chuse to live together on such Terms? What Relish then must the World have (that common World of mix'd and undistinguish'd Company) without a little Solitude; without stepping now and then aside, out of the Road and beaten Track of Life, that tedious Circle of Noise and Show, which forces weary'd Mankind to seek relief from every poor Diversion?","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By your Rule, said I, Theocles, there shou'd be no such thing as Happiness or Good in Life, since every Enjoyment wears out so soon; and growing painful, is diverted by some other thing; and that again by some other; and so on. I am sure, if Solitude serves as a Remedy or Diversion to any thing in the World, there is nothing which may not serve as Diversion to Solitude; which wants it more than any thing besides. And thus there can be no Good which is regular or constant. Happiness is a thing out of the way, and only to be found in wandring.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"O Philocles, reply'd he, {Happiness. Good.} I rejoice to find you in the pursuit of Happiness and Good; however you may wander. Nay, tho you doubt whether there be that Thing; yet if you reason, 'tis sufficient; there is hope still. But see how you have unawares engag'd your-self! For if you have destroy'd all Good, because in all you can think of, there is nothing will constantly hold so; then you have set it as a Maxim, (and very justly in my Opinion) \"That Nothing can be good but what is constant.\"","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I own, said I, that all I know of worldly Satisfaction is inconstant. The Things which give it, are never at a stay: and the Good it-self, whatever it be, depends no less on Humour than on Fortune. For that which Chance may often spare, Time will not. Age, Change of Temper, other Thoughts, a different Passion, new Engagements, a new Turn of Life, or Conversation, the least of these are fatal, and alone sufficient to destroy Enjoyment. Tho the Object be the same, the Relish changes, and the short-liv'd Good expires. But I shou'd wonder much if you cou'd tell me any thing in Life, which was not of as changeable a Nature, and subject to the same common Fate of Satiety and Disgust.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Pleasure.} I FIND then, reply'd he, that the current Notion of Good is not sufficient to satisfy you. You can afford to scepticize, where no-one else will so much as hesitate. For almost every-one philosophizes dogmatically on this Head.

But when Will and Pleasure are synonymous; when every thing which pleases us is call'd Pleasure, and we never chuse or prefer but as we please, 'tis trifling to say, \"Pleasure is our Good.\" For this has as little meaning as to say, \"We chuse what we think eligible\": and, \"We are pleas'd with what delights or pleases us.\" The Question is, \"Whether we are rightly pleas'd, and chuse as we shou'd do?\" For as highly pleas'd as Children are with Baubles, or with whatever affects their tender Senses; we cannot in our hearts sincerely admire their Enjoyment, or imagine 'em Possessors of any extraordinary Good. Yet are their Senses, we know, as keen and susceptible of Pleasure as our own. The same Reflection is of force as to mere Animals, who in respect of the Liveliness and Delicacy of Sensation, have many of 'em the advantage of us. And as for some low and sordid Pleasures of human Kind; shou'd they be ever so lastingly enjoy'd, and in the highest credit with their Enjoyers; I shou'd never afford 'em the name of Happiness or Good.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Wou'd you then appeal, said he, from the immediate Feeling and Experience of one who is pleas'd, and satisfy'd with what he enjoys?","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Most certainly I shou'd appeal, said I, (continuing the same Zeal which Theocles had stirr'd in me, against those Dogmatizers on Pleasure). For is there that sordid Creature on earth, who does not prize his own Enjoyment? Does not the frowardest, the most rancorous distemper'd Creature do as much? Is not Malice and Cruelty of the highest relish with some Natures? Is not a hoggish Life the height of some Mens Wishes? You wou'd not ask me surely to enumerate the several Species of Sensations, which Men of certain Tastes have adopted, and own'd for their chief Pleasure and Delight. For with some Men even Diseases have been thought valuable and worth the cherishing, merely for the Pleasure found in allaying the Ardor of an irritating Sensation. And to these absurd Epicures those other are near a-kin, who by study'd Provocatives raise unnatural Thirst and Appetite; and to make way for fresh Repletion, prepare Emeticks, as the last Desert; the sooner to renew the Feast. 'Tis said, I know, proverbially, \"That Tastes are different, and must not be disputed.\" And I remember some such Motto as this plac'd once on a Devise, which was found sutable to the Notion. A Fly was represented feeding on a certain Lump. The Food, however vile, was natural to the Animal. There was no Absurdity in the Case. But shou'd you shew me a brutish or a barbarous Man thus taken up, and solac'd in his Pleasure; shou'd you shew me a Sot in his solitary Debauch, or a Tyrant in the exercise of his Cruelty, with this Motto over him, to forbid my Appeal; I shou'd hardly be brought to think the better of his Enjoyment: Nor can I possibly suppose that a mere sordid Wretch, with a base abject Soul, and the best Fortune in the World, was ever capable of any real Enjoyment.","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this Zeal, reply'd Theocles, which you have shewn in the refuting a wrong Hypothesis, one wou'd imagine you had in reality some Notion of a right; and began to think that there might possibly be such a thing at last as Good.","subId":"14","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That there is something nearer to Good, and more like it than another, I am free, said I, to own. But what real Good is, I am still to seek, and must therefore wait till you can better inform me. This I only know; \"That either All Pleasure is Good, or only Some.\" If all, then every kind of Sensuality must be precious and desirable. If some only, then we are to seek, what kind; and discover, if we can, what it is which distinguishes between one Pleasure and another: and makes one indifferent, sorry, mean; another valuable, and worthy. And by this Stamp, this Character, if there be any such, we must define Good; and not by Pleasure it-self; which may be very great, and yet very contemptible. Nor can any-one truly judg the Value of any immediate Sensation, otherwise than by judging first of the Situation of his own Mind. For that which we esteem a Happiness in one Situation of Mind, is otherwise thought of in another. Which Situation therefore is the justest, must be consider'd; \"How to gain that Point of Sight, whence probably we may best discern; and How to place our-selves in that unbiass'd State, in which we are fittest to pronounce.\"","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"OPhilocles, reply'd he, if this be unfeignedly your Sentiment; if it be possible you shou'd have the Fortitude to with-hold your Assent in this Affair, and go in search of what the meanest of Mankind think they already know so certainly: 'tis from a nobler turn of thought than what you have observ'd in any of the modern Scepticks you have convers'd with. For if I mistake not, there are hardly anywhere at this day a sort of People more peremptory, or who deliberate less on the choice of Good. They who pretend to such a Scrutiny of other Evidences, are the readiest to take the Evidence of the greatest Deceivers in the World, their own Passions. Having gain'd, as they think, a Liberty from some seeming Constraints of Religion, they suppose they employ this Liberty to perfection, by following the first Motion of their Will, and assenting to the first Dictate or Report of any prepossessing Fancy, any foremost Opinion or Conceit of Good. So that their Privilege is only that of being perpetually amus'd; and their Liberty that of being impos'd on in their most important Choice. I think one may say with assurance, \"That the greatest of Fools is he who imposes on himself, and in his greatest Concern thinks certainly he knows that which he has least study'd, and of which he is most profoundly ignorant.\" He who is ignorant, but knows his Ignorance, is far wiser. And to do justice to these fashionable Men of Wit; they are not all of 'em, indeed, so insensible as not to perceive something of their own Blindness and Absurdity. For often when they seriously reflect on their past Pursuits and Engagements, they freely own, \"That for what remains of Life, they know not whether they shall be of a-piece with themselves; or whether their Fancy, Humour, or Passion will not hereafter lead 'em to a quite different Choice in Pleasure, and to a Disapprobation of all they ever enjoy'd before.\"—Comfortable Reflection!","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To bring the Satisfactions of the Mind, continu'd he, and the Enjoyments of Reason and Judgment under the Denomination of Pleasure, is only a Collusion, and a plain receding from the common Notion of the Word. They deal not fairly with us, who in their philosophical Hour, admit that for Pleasure, which at an ordinary time, and in the common Practice of Life, is so little taken for such. The Mathematician who labours at his Problem, the bookish Man who toils, the Artist who endures voluntarily the greatest Hardships and Fatigues; none of these are said \"To follow Pleasure.\" Nor will the Men of Pleasure by any means admit 'em to be of their number. The Satisfactions which are purely mental, and depend only on the Motion of a Thought; must in all likelihood be too refin'd for the Apprehensions of our modern Epicures, who are so taken up with Pleasure of a more substantial kind. They who are full of the Idea of such a sensible solid Good, can have but a slender Fancy for the mere spiritual and intellectual sort. But 'tis this latter they set up and magnify upon occasion; to save the Ignominy which may redound to 'em from the former. This done, the latter may take its chance: Its Use is presently at an end. For 'tis observable, that when the Men of this sort have recommended the Enjoyments of the Mind under the title of Pleasure; when they have thus dignify'd the Word, and included in it whatever is mentally good or excellent, they can afterwards suffer it contentedly to slide down again into its own genuine and vulgar Sense; whence they rais'd it only to serve a turn. When Pleasure is call'd in question, and attack'd, then Reason and Virtue are call'd in to her Aid, and made principal parts of her Constitution. A complicated Form appears, and comprehends straight all which is generous, honest, and beautiful in human Life. But when the Attack is over, and the Objection once solv'd, the Specter vanishes: Pleasure returns again to her former Shape: She may e'en be Pleasure still, and have as little concern with dry sober Reason, as in the nature of the thing, and according to common Understanding, she really has. For if this rational sort of Enjoyment be admitted into the Notion of Good, how is it possible to admit withal that kind of Sensation, which in effect is rather opposite to this Enjoyment? 'Tis certain that in respect of the Mind and its Enjoyments, the Eagerness and Irritation of mere Pleasure, {Pleasure and Pain.} is as disturbing as the Importunity and Vexation of Pain. If either throws the Mind off its biass, and deprives it of the Satisfaction it takes in its natural Exercise and Employment; the Mind in this case must be Sufferer as well by one as by the other. If neither does this, there is no harm on either side.—","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By the way, said I, interrupting him; As sincere as I am in questioning, \"Whether Pleasure be really Good\"; I am not such a Sceptick as to doubt \"Whether Pain be really Ill.\"","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whatever is grievous, reply'd he, can be no other than Ill. But that what is grievous to one, is not so much as troublesom to another; let Sportsmen, Soldiers, and others of the hardy Kinds be witness. Nay, that what is Pain to one, is Pleasure to another, and so alternately, we very well know: since Men vary in their Apprehension of these Sensations, and on many occasions confound one with the other. Has not even Nature her-self, in some respects, as it were blended 'em together, and (as a wise Man said once) \"join'd the Extremity of one so nicely to the other, that it absolutely runs into it, and is undistinguishable?\"","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"IN FINE then, said I, if Pleasure and Pain be thus convertible and mix'd; if, according to your Account, \"That which is now Pleasure, by being strain'd a little too far, runs into Pain, and Pain, when carry'd far, creates again the highest Pleasure, by mere Cessation, and a kind of natural Succession; if some Pleasures to some are Pains, and some Pains to others are Pleasures\": All this, if I mistake not, makes still for my Opinion, and shows That there is nothing you can assign which can really stand as Good. {Good.} For if Pleasure be not Good, nothing is. And if Pain be Ill, (as I must necessarily take for granted) we have a shreud Chance on the ill side indeed, but none at all on the better. So that we may fairly doubt, \"Whether Life it-self be not mere Misery\"; since Gainers by it we can never be: Losers we may sufficiently, and are like to be, every hour of our Lives. Accordingly, what our English Poetess says of Good, shou'd be just and proper: \" 'Tis good not to be born.\"—And thus for any thing of Good which can be expected in Life, we may e'en \"Beg pardon of Nature; and return her Present on her hands, without waiting for her Call.\" For what shou'd hinder us? or What are we the better for living?","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.1.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Query, said he, is pertinent. But why such Dispatch, if the Case be doubtful? This, surely, my good Philocles! is a plain Transgression of your sceptical Bounds. We must be sufficiently dogmatical, to come to this Determination. {Futurity.} 'Tis a deciding as well concerning Death as Life; \"What possibly may be hereafter, and What not.\" Now to be assur'd that we can never be concern'd in any thing hereafter, we must understand perfectly what it is which concerns or engages us in any thing present. We must truly know our-selves, {Self.} and in what this Self of ours consists. We must determine against Pre-existence, and give a better reason for our having never been concern'd in ought before our Birth, than merely, \"Because we remember not, nor are conscious.\" For in many things we have been concern'd to purpose, of which we have now no Memory or Consciousness remaining. And thus we may happen to be again and again, to perpetuity, for any reason we can show to the contrary. All is Revolution in us. We are no more the self-same Matter, or System of Matter, from one day to another. What Succession there may be hereafter, we know not; since even now, we live by Succession, and only perish and are renew'd. 'Tis in vain we flatter our-selves with the assurance of our Interest's ending with a certain Shape or Form. What interested us at first in it, we know not; any more than how we have since held on, and continue still concern'd in such an Assemblage of fleeting Particles. Where besides, or in What else we may have to do, {Futurity.} perchance, in time to come, we know as little; nor can tell how Chance or Providence, hereafter, may dispose of us. And if Providence be in the case, we have still more reason to consider how we undertake to be our own Disposers. It must needs become a Sceptick above all Men to hesitate in matters of Exchange. And tho he acknowledges no present Good or Enjoyment in Life, he must be sure, however, of bettering his Condition, before he attempts to alter it.

Or whether when you first prov'd this generous Pleasure, you did not feel it less than at this present; after so long Experience? Believe me, Philocles, this Pleasure is more debauching than any other. Never did any Soul do good, but it came readier to do the same again, with more Enjoyment. Never was Love, or Gratitude, or Bounty practis'd but with increasing Joy, which made the Practiser still more in love with the fair Act. {Friendship private, publick.} Answer me, Philocles, you who are such a Judg of Beauty, and have so good a Taste of Pleasure; is there any thing you admire, so fair as Friendship? or any thing so charming as a generous Action?
