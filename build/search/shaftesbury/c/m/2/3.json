The Word or Name of Atheist may possibly occasion some disturbance, by being made to describe two Characters so very different as His who absolutely denies, and His who only doubts. Now he who doubts, may possibly lament his own Unhappiness, and wish to be convinc'd. He who denies, is daringly presumptuous, and sets up an Opinion against the Interest of Mankind, and Being of Society. 'Tis easily seen that one of these Persons may bear a due respect to the Magistrate and Laws, tho not the other; who being obnoxious to them, {Punishment.} is therefore punishable.

Now the Language of the Magistrate, I must confess, has little in common with that of Philosophy. Nothing can be more unbecoming the magisterial Authority than a philosophical Style: and nothing can be more unphilosophical than a magisterial one. A Mixture of these must needs spoil both.

There are not, 'tis thought, many Persons in the World who are loose in the very Grounds and Principles of all Religion: And to such as these we find, indeed, there are not many Writers who purposely apply themselves. They may think it a mean Labour, and scarce becoming them, to argue sedately with such as are almost universally treated with Detestation and Horror. But as we are requir'd by our Religion to have Charity for all Men, so we cannot surely avoid having a real Concern for those whom we apprehend to be under the worst of Errors, and whom we find by Experience to be with the greatest difficulty reclaim'd. Neither ought they perhaps in prudence to be treated with so little regard, whose Number, however small, is thought to be rather increasing; and this too among the People of no despicable Rank. So that it may well deserve some Consideration, \"Whether in our Age and Country the same Remedys may serve, which have hitherto been try'd; or whether some other may not be prefer'd, as being sutable to Times of less Strictness in Matters of Religion, and Places less subject to Authority.\"","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This might be enough to put an Author upon thinking of such a way of reasoning with these deluded Persons, as in his Opinion might be more effectual for their Benefit, than the repeated Exclamations and Invectives with which most of the Arguments us'd against them are commonly accompany'd.

For to such Persons as these, 'tis to be fear'd, 'twill always appear, \"That what was never question'd, was never prov'd: and That whatever Subject had not, at some time or other, been examin'd with perfect Indifference, was never rightly examin'd, nor cou'd rightly be believ'd.\" And in a Treatise of this kind, offer'd as an Essay or Inquiry only, they wou'd be far from finding that Impartiality and Indifference which is requisite: if instead of a Readiness to comply with whatever Consequences such an Examination as this, and the Course of Reasoning brought forth, the Author shou'd shew a previous Inclination to the Consequences only on one side, and an Abhorrence of any Conclusion on the other.","subId":"14","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Others therefore, in different Circumstances, may perhaps have found it necessary, and becoming their Character, to shew all manner of Detestation both of the Persons and Principles of these Men.

He offers to conclude nothing positive himself, but leaves it to others to draw Conclusions from his Principles: having this one chief Aim and Intention; \"How, in the first place, to reconcile these Persons to the Principles of Virtue; That by this means, a Way might be laid open to Religion; by removing those greatest, if not only Obstacles to it, which arise from the Vices and Passions of Men.\"","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Fundamental Principles.} 'Tis upon this account he endeavours chiefly to establish Virtue on Principles, by which he is able to argue with those who are not as yet induc'd to own a God, or Future State.

He can impose on no-one who reasons deeply: since whoever does so, will easily conceive, that at this rate Theology must have no Foundation at all.

Nothing can be more unbecoming than to talk magisterially and in venerable Terms of \"A supreme Nature, an infinite Being, and aDeity \"; when all the while a Providence is never meant, nor any thing like Order or the Government of a Mind admitted. For when these are understood, and real Divinity acknowledg'd; the Notion is not dry, and barren; but such Consequences are necessarily drawn from it, as must set us in Action, and find Employment for our strongest Affections.

On the other hand, that there were those who in opposition to this devout mystick way, and as profess'd Enemys to what they call Enthusiasm, had so far exploded every thing of this ecstatick kind, as in a manner to have given up Devotion; and in reality had left so little of Zeal, Affection, or Warmth, in what they call their Rational Religion, as to make them much suspected of their Sincerity in any. For tho it be natural enough (he wou'd tell you) for a mere political Writer to ground his great Argument for Religion on the necessity of such a Belief as that of a future Reward and Punishment; yet, if you will take his Opinion, 'tis a very ill Token of Sincerity in Religion, and in the Christian Religion more especially, to reduce it to such a Philosophy as will allow no room to that other Principle of Love; but treats all of that kind as Enthusiasm, for so much as aiming at what is call'd Disinterestedness, or teaching the Love of God or Virtue for God or Virtue' s sake.","subId":"24","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here, then, we have two sorts of People (according to my Friend's account) who in these opposite Extremes expose Religion to the Insults of its Adversarys.

For how shall one deny, that to serve God by Compulsion, or for Interest merely, is servile and mercenary? Is it not evident, that the only true and liberal Service paid either to that supreme Being, or to any other Superior, is that, \"which proceeds from an Esteem or Love of the Person serv'd, a Sense of Duty or Gratitude, and a Love of the dutiful and grateful Part, as good and amiable, in it-self?\" And where is the Injury to Religion, from such a Concession as this? Or what Detraction is it from the Belief of an After-Reward or Punishment, to own \"That the Service caus'd by it, is not equal to that which is voluntary and with Inclination, but is rather disingenuous and of the slavish kind?\" Is it not still for the Good of Mankind and of the World, that Obedience to the Rule of Right shou'd some way or other be paid; if not in the better way, yet at least in this imperfect one? And is it not to be shewn, \"That altho this Service of Fear be allow'd ever so low or base: yet Religion still being a Discipline, and Progress of the Soul towards Perfection, the Motive of Reward and Punishment is primary and of the highest moment with us; {Rewards and Punishments.} till being capable of more sublime Instruction, we are led from this servile State, to the generous Service of Affection and Love?\"","subId":"25","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To this it is that in our Friend's Opinion we ought all of us to aspire, so as to endeavour \"That the Excellence of the Object, not the Reward or Punishment, shou'd be our Motive: But that where thro' the Corruption of our Nature, the former of these Motives is found insufficient to excite to Virtue, there the latter shou'd be brought in aid, {Supplemental Motives.} and on no account be undervalu'd or neglected.\"","subId":"26","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now this being once establish'd, how can Religion be any longer subject to the Imputation of Mercenariness?

Is it confess'd there may be a better Service, a more generous Love?â€”Enough, there needs no more. On this Foundation our Friend presumes it easy to defend Religion, and even that devoutest Part, which is esteem'd so great a Paradox of Faith. For if there be in Nature such a Service as that of Affection and Love, {Object of Love.} there remains then only to consider of the Object, whether there be really that supreme-One we suppose. For if there be divine Excellence in Things; if there be in Nature a supreme Mind or Deity; we have then an Object consummate, and comprehensive of all which is good or excellent. And this Object, of all others, must of necessity be the most amiable, the most ingaging, and of highest Satisfaction and Enjoyment. Now that there is such a principal Object as this in the World, the World alone (if I may say so) by its wise and perfect Order must evince. This Order, if indeed perfect, excludes all real Ill. And that it really does so, is what our Author so earnestly maintains, by solving the best he can those untoward Phaenomena and ill Signs, taken from the Course of Providence in the seemingly unequal Lot of Virtue in this World.","subId":"27","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.3.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis true: tho the Appearances hold ever so strongly against Virtue, and in favour of Vice, the Objection which arises hence against a Deity may be easily remov'd, and all set right again on the supposal of a future State. This to a Christian, {Future State.} or one already convinc'd of so great a Point, is sufficient to clear every dark Cloud of Providence. For he needs not be over-and-above sollicitous as to the Fate of Virtue in this World, who is secure of Hereafter. But the case is otherwise as to the People we are here to encounter. They are at a loss for Providence, and seek to find it in the World. The Aggravation of the appearing Disorders in worldly Affairs, and the blackest Representation of Society and Human Nature, will hardly help 'em to this View. 'Twill be difficult for 'em to read Providence in such Characters. From so uncomely a Face of things below, they will presume to think unfavourably of all above. By the Effects they see, they will be inclin'd to judg the Cause; and by the Fate of Virtue to determine of a Providence. But being once convinc'd of Order and a Providence as to things present, {Previous Proof.} they may soon, perhaps, be satisfy'd even of a future State. For if Virtue be to it-self no small Reward, and Vice in a great measure its own Punishment; we have a solid ground to go upon. {A Providence. ORDER.} The plain Foundations of a distributive Justice, and due Order in this World, may lead us to conceive a further Building. We apprehend a larger Scheme, and easily resolve our-selves why Things were not compleated in this State; but their Accomplishment reserv'd rather to some further Period.

Where had the Virtues had their Theater, or whence their Names? Where had been Temperance or Self-denial? Where Patience, Meekness, Magnanimity? Whence have these their being?
