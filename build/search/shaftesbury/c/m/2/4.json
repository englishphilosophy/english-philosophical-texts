Let it be a State of War, Rapine, and Injustice. Since 'tis unsocial, let it e'en be as uncomfortable and as frightful as 'tis possible. To speak well of it, is to render it inviting, and tempt Men to turn Hermites. Let it, at least, be look'd on as many degrees worse than the worst Government in being. The greater Dread we have of Anarchy, the better Country-men we shall prove, and value more the Laws and Constitution under which we live, and by which we are protected from the outrageous Violences of such an unnatural State. In this I agree heartily with those Transformers of Human Nature, who considering it abstractedly and apart from Government or Society, represent it under monstrous Visages of Dragons, Leviathans, and I know not what devouring Creatures. They wou'd have done well however, to have express'd themselves more properly in their great Maxim. For to say in disparagement of Man, \"That he is to Man a Wolf,\" appears somewhat absurd, when one considers that Wolves are to Wolves very kind and loving Creatures. The Sexes strictly join in the Care and Nurture of the Young; and this Union is continu'd still between 'em. They houl to one another, to bring Company; whether to hunt, or invade their Prey, or assemble on the discovery of a good Carcase. Even the swinish Kinds want not common Affection, and run in Herds to the assistance of their distress'd Fellows. The meaning therefore of this famous Sentence, if it has any meaning at all, must be, \"That Man is naturally to Man, as a Wolf is to a tamer Creature\": as, for instance, to a Sheep. But this will be as little to the purpose as to tell us, \"That there are different Species or Characters of Men; That all have not this wolfish Nature, but That one half at least are naturally innocent and mild.\" And thus the Sentence comes to nothing. For without belying Nature, and contradicting what is evident from natural History, Fact, and the plain Course of Things, 'tis impossible to assent to this ill-natur'd Proposition, when we have even done our best to make tolerable sense of it.—But such is Mankind! And even here HumanNature shews it-self, such as it is; not perfect, or absolutely successful, tho rightly tending, {Sect. 5.} and mov'd by proper and just Principles. 'Tis here, therefore, in Philosophy, as in the common Conversations of the World. As fond as Men are of Company, and as little able to enjoy any Happiness out of it, they are yet strangely addicted to the way of Satir. And in the same manner, as a malicious Censure craftily worded, and pronounc'd with Assurance, is apt to pass with Mankind for shreud Wit; so a virulent Maxim in bold Expressions, tho without any Justness of Thought, is readily receiv'd for true Philosophy.","subId":"61","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.2.4.61"},{"type":"note","content":"Vid.
