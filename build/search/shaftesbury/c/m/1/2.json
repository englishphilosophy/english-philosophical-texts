The Verdure of the Field, the distant Prospects, the gilded Horizon, and purple Sky, form'd by a setting Sun, had Charms in abundance, and were able to make impression on you. Here, Palemon, you allow'd me to admire as much as I pleas'd; when, at the same instant, you wou'd not bear my talking to you of those nearer Beautys of our own Kind, which I thought more natural for Men at our Age to admire. Your Severity however cou'd not silence me upon this Subject. I continu'd to plead the Cause of the Fair, and advance their Charms above all those other Beautys of Nature. And when you took advantage from this Opposition, to shew how little there was of Nature, and how much of Art in what I admir'd, I made the best Apology I cou'd; and fighting for Beauty, kept the Field as long as there was one Fair-one present.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Gallantry.} Considering how your Genius stood inclin'd to Poetry, I wonder'd most to find you on a sudden grown so out of conceit with our modern Poets, and Galante Writers; whom I quoted to you, as better Authoritys than any Antient in behalf of the Fair Sex, and their Prerogative. But this you treated slightly. You acknowledg'd it to be true indeed, what had been observ'd by some late Wits, \"That Gallantry was of a modern Growth.\" And well it might be so, you thought, without dishonour to the Antients; who understood Truth and Nature too well, to admit so ridiculous an Invention.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Twas in vain, therefore, that I held up this Shield in my defense. I did my Cause no service, when in behalf of the Fair I pleaded all the fine things which are usually said, in this romantick way, to their advantage. You attack'd the very Fortress of Gallantry, ridicul'd the Point of Honour, with all those nice Sentiments and Ceremonials belonging to it. You damn'd even our Favourite Novels; those dear sweet natural Pieces, writ most of 'em by the Fair Sex themselves. In short, this whole Order and Scheme of Wit you condemn'd absolutely, as false, monstrous, and Gothick; quite out of the way of Nature, and sprung from the mere Dregs of Chivalry or Knight-Errantry; a thing which in it-self you prefer'd, as of a better Taste than that which reigns at present in its stead. For at a time when this Mystery of Gallantry carry'd along with it the Notion of doughty Knighthood; when the Fair were made Witnesses, and in a manner, Partys to Feats of Arms, enter'd into all the Points of War and Combat, and were won by dint of Launce and manly Prowess; 'twas not altogether absurd, you thought, on such a foundation as this, to pay 'em Homage and Adoration, make 'em the Standard of Wit and Manners, and bring Mankind under their Laws. But in a Country where no She-Saints were worship'd by any Authority from Religion, 'twas as impertinent and sensless, as it was profane, to deify the Sex, raise 'em to a Capacity above what Nature had allow'd, and treat 'em with a Respect, which in the natural way of Love they themselves were the aptest to complain of.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Indeed as for the Moral Part, 'twas wonderful, you said, to observe the Licentiousness which this foppish courtly Humour had establish'd in the World. What such a flattering way of Address to all the Sex in common cou'd mean, you knew not; unless it were to render 'em wholly common indeed, and make each Fair-one apprehend that the Publick had a right to her; and that Beauty was too communicative and divine a Thing, to be made a Property, and confin'd to One at once.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"MEAN while our Company began to leave us. The Beau-monde, whom you had been thus severely censuring, drew off apace: for it grew late. I took notice that the approaching Objects of the Night were the more agreeable to you, for the Solitude they introduc'd; and that the Moon and Planets which began now to appear, were in reality the only proper Company for a Man in your Humour. For now you began to talk with much Satisfaction of natural Things, and of all Orders of Beautys, Man only excepted. Never did I hear a finer Description than you made of the Order of the heavenly Luminarys, the Circles of the Planets, and their attendent Satellites. And you, who wou'd allow nothing to those fair earthly Luminarys in the Circles which just now we mov'd in; you, Palemon, who seem'd to overlook the Pride of that Theater, began now to look out with Ravishment on this other, and triumph in the new philosophical Scene of Worlds unknown. Here, when you had pretty well spent the first Fire of your Imagination, I wou'd have got you to reason more calmly with me upon that other Part of the Creation, your own Kind; to which, I told you, you discover'd so much Aversion, {Misanthropy.} as wou'd make one believe you a compleat Timon, or Man-hater.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Can you then, OPhilocles, \" (said you in a high strain, and with a moving air of Passion) \"Can you believe me of that Character? Or can you think it of me in earnest, that being Man, and conscious of my Nature, I shou'd have yet so little of Humanity, as not to feel the Affections of a Man? Or feeling what is natural towards my Kind, that I shou'd hold their Interest light, and be indifferently affected with what affects or seriously concerns them? Am I so ill a Lover of my Country? Or is it that you find me indeed so ill a Friend? For what are all Relations else? What are the Ties of private Friendship, if that to Mankind be not obliging? Can there be yet a Bond in Nature, if That be none? OPhilocles! Believe me when I say I feel it one, and fully prove its Power within me. Think not that I wou'd willingly break my Chain: Nor count me so degenerate or unnatural, as whilst I hold this Form, and wear a human Heart, I shou'd throw off Love, Compassion, Kindness, and not befriend Mankind.—But O what Treacherys! what Disorders! And how corrupt is all!—Did you not observe e'en now, when all this Space was fill'd with goodly Rows of Company, how peaceful all appear'd.—What Charms there are in publick Companys! What Harmony in Courts and Courtly Places! How pleas'd is every Face! How courteous and humane the general Carriage and Behaviour!—What Creature capable of Reflection, if he thus saw us Mankind, and saw no more, wou'd not believe our Earth a very Heaven? What Foreigner (the Inhabitant, suppose, of some near Planet) when he had travel'd hither, and survey'd this outward Face of things, wou'd think of what lay hid beneath the Mask?—But let him stay a-while. Allow him leisure; till he has gain'd a nearer View, and following our dissolv'd Assemblys to their particular Recesses, he has the power of seeing 'em in this new Aspect.—Here he may behold those great Men of the Ministry, who not an hour ago in publick appear'd such Friends, now plotting craftily each other's Ruin, with the Ruin of the State it-self, a Sacrifice to their Ambition. Here he may see too those of a softer kind, who knowing not Ambition, follow only Love.

'Twas not for want of being affected with what you spoke. I only imagin'd a more particular Cause had provok'd you, when having pass'd over the Ambitious, you were coming full-charg'd against the People of a softer Passion. At first, I look'd on you as deeply in the Spleen: But now I concluded you in love, and so unhappily engag'd as to have reason to complain of Infidelity. \"This,\" thought I, \"has mov'd Palemon thus.

And this insensibly led us into a nice Criticism of Nature; whom you sharply arraign'd for many Absurditys you thought her guilty of, in relation to Mankind, and his peculiar State.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Fain wou'd I have persuaded you to think with more Equality of Nature, and to proportion her Defects a little better. My Notion was, that the Grievance lay not altogether in one part, as you plac'd it; but that every thing had its share of Inconvenience. Pleasure and Pain, Beauty and Deformity, Good and Ill, seem'd to me every-where interwoven; and one with another made, I thought, a pretty Mixture, agreeable enough, in the main. 'Twas the same, I fansy'd, as in some of those rich Stuffs, where the Flowers and Ground were oddly put together, with such irregular Work, and contrary Colours, as look'd ill in the Pattern, but mighty natural and well in the Piece.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But you were still upon Extremes. Nothing wou'd serve to excuse the Faults or Blemishes of this Part of the Creation, Mankind; even tho all besides were fair, without a Blemish. The very Storms and Tempests had their Beauty in your account, those alone excepted which arose in human Breasts. 'Twas only for this turbulent Race of Mortals you offer'd to accuse Nature. And I now found why you had been so transported with the Story of Prometheus. You wanted such an Operator as this for Mankind: And you were tempted to wish the Story cou'd have been confirm'd in modern Divinity; that clearing the supreme Powers of any Concern or Hand in the ill Workmanship, you might have the liberty of inveighing against it, without Profaneness.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This however, I told you, was but a slight Evasion of the religious Poets among the Antients.

Why so many Plagues, and Curses, entail'd on him and his Posterity?\"—Prometheus was the Cause. The plastick Artist, with his unlucky Hand, solv'd all. \" 'Twas His Contrivance (they said) and He was to answer for it.\" They reckon'd it a fair Game, if they cou'd gain a single Remove, and put the evil Cause farther off. If the People ask'd a Question, they told 'em a Tale, and sent 'em away satisfy'd.

We ought not to laugh so readily at the Indian Philosophers, who to satisfy their People how this huge Frame of the World is supported, tell 'em 'tis by an Elephant.—And the Elephant how?—A shreud Question! but which by no means shou'd be answer'd. 'Tis here only that our Indian Philosophers are to blame. They shou'd be contented with the Elephant, and go no further. But they have a Tortoise in reverse; whose Back, they think, is broad enough.

He resolv'd, it seems, to be Neuter; and see what wou'd come of this notable Experiment; how the dangerous Man-moulder wou'd proceed; and what wou'd be the Event of his Tampering.—Excellent Account, to satisfy the Heathen Vulgar! But how, think you, wou'd a Philosopher digest this? \"For the Gods\" (he wou'd say presently) \"either cou'd have hinder'd Prometheus' s Creation, or they cou'd not. If they cou'd, they were answerable for the Consequences; if they cou'd not, they were no longer Gods, being thus limited and controul'd.

Whether it must not be a very strong philosophical Faith, which shou'd persuade one that those dismal Parts you set to view were only the necessary Shades of a fine Piece, to be reckon'd among the Beautys of the Creation: Or whether possibly you might look upon that Maxim as very fit for Heaven, which I was sure you did not approve at all in Mankind; \"To do Ill that Good might follow.\"","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This, I said, made me think of the manner of our modern Prometheus's, the Mountebanks, who perform'd such Wonders of many kinds, here on our earthly Stages.

Shou'd we dare to make such Empiricks of the Gods, and such a Patient of poor Nature? \"Was this a reason for Nature's Sickliness? Or how else came she (poor Innocent!) to fall sick, or run astray?

And here not only Religion was objected to me, but I was reproach'd too on the account of that Gallantry which I had some time before defended. Both were join'd together in the Charge you made against me, when you saw I adher'd to nothing: but was now as ready to declaim against the Fair, as I had been before to plead their Cause, and defend the Moral of Lovers. This, you said, was my constant way in all Debates: I was as well pleas'd with the Reason on one side, as on the other: I never troubled my-self about the Success of the Argument, but laugh'd still, whatever way it went; and even when I convinc'd others, never seem'd as if I was convinc'd myself.","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I own'd to you, Palemon, there was Truth enough in your Charge. For above all things I lov'd Ease; and of all Philosophers those who reason'd most at their ease, and were never angry or disturb'd; as those call'd Scepticks, you own'd, never were. I look'd upon this kind of Philosophy as the prettiest, agreeablest, roving Exercise of the Mind, possible to be imagin'd. The other kind, I thought, was painful and laborious; \"To keep always in the Limits of one Path; to drive always at a Point; and hold precisely to what Men, at a venture, call'd theTruth: A Point, in all appearance, very unfix'd, and hard to ascertain.\" Besides, my way hurt no body. I was always the first to comply on any occasion; and for Matters of Religion, was further from Profaneness and erroneous Doctrine than any-one. I cou'd never have the Sufficiency to shock my spiritual and learned Superiors. I was the furthest from leaning to my own Understanding: nor was I one who exalted Reason above Faith, or insisted much upon what the dogmatical Men call Demonstration, and dare oppose to the sacred Mysterys of Religion. And to shew you, continu'd I, how impossible it is for the Men of our sort ever to err from the Catholick and Establish'd Faith, pray consider; That whereas Others pretend to see with their own Eyes, what is properest and best for them in Religion; We, for our parts, pretend not to see with any other than those of our spiritual Guides. Neither do we presume to judg those Guides our-selves; but submit to them, as they are appointed us by our just Superiors. In short, you who are Rationalists, and walk by Reason in every thing, pretend to know all things, whilst you believe little or nothing: We for our parts know nothing, and believe all.","subId":"20","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"HERE I ended; and, in return, you only ask'd me coldly, \"Whether with that fine Scepticism of mine, I made no more distinction between Sincerity and Insincerity in Actions, than I did between Truth and Falshood, Right and Wrong, in Arguments?\"","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.2.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I durst not ask what your Question drove at.

Do not imagine that I dare aspire so high as to defend reveal'd Religion, or the holy Mysterys of the Christian Faith. I am unworthy of such a Task, and shou'd profane the Subject.
