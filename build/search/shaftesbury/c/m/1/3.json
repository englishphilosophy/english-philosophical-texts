Your Over-seriousness a-while since, at such an unseasonable time, may have driven me perhaps into a contrary Extreme, by opposition to your melancholy Humour. But I have now a better Idea of that Melancholy you discover'd; and notwithstanding the humorous Turn you were pleas'd to give it, I am persuaded it has a different Foundation from any of those fantastical Causes I then assign'd to it. \"Love, {LOVE.} doubtless, is at the bottom; but a nobler Love than such as common Beautys inspire.\"â€”","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here, in my turn, I began to raise my Voice, and imitate the solemn way you had been teaching me. \"Knowing as you are,\" continu'd I, \"well-knowing and experienc'd in all the Degrees and Orders of Beauty, {Beauty.} in all the mysterious Charms of the particular Forms; you rise to what is more general; and with a larger Heart, and Mind more comprehensive, you generously seek that which is highest in the kind. Not captivated by the Lineaments of a fair Face, or the well-drawn Proportions of a human Body, you view the Life it-self, and embrace rather the Mind, which adds the Lustre, and renders chiefly amiable.\"","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Society.} \"Nor is the Enjoyment of such a single Beauty sufficient to satisfy such an aspiring Soul. It seeks how to combine more Beautys, and by what Coalition of these, to form a beautiful Society. It views Communitys, Friendships, Relations, Dutys; and considers by what Harmony of particular Minds the general Harmony is compos'd, and Commonweal establish'd.\"","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Nor satisfy'd even with publick Good in one Community of Men, it frames it-self a nobler Object, {Virtue.} and with enlarg'd Affection seeks the Good of Mankind. It dwells with Pleasure amidst that Reason, and those Orders on which this fair Correspondence and goodly Interest is establish'd. Laws, Constitutions, civil and religious Rites; whatever civilizes or polishes rude Mankind; the Sciences and Arts, Philosophy, Morals, Virtue; the flourishing State of human Affairs, and the Perfection of human Nature; these are its delightful Prospects, and this the Charm of Beauty which attracts it.\"","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Universe.} \"Still ardent in this Pursuit (such is its Love of Order and Perfection) it rests not here; nor satisfies it-self with the Beauty of a Part; but extending further its communicative Bounty, seeks the Good of All, and affects the Interest and Prosperity of the Whole.

Monsters arise, not those from Lybian Desarts, but from the Heart of Man more fertile; and with their horrid Aspect cast an unseemly Reflection upon Nature. She, helpless (as she is thought) and working thus absurdly, is contemn'd, the Government of the World arraign'd, and Deity made void.\"","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Much is alledg'd in answer, to shew why Nature errs, and how she came thus impotent and erring from an unerring Hand. But I deny she errs; and when she seems most ignorant or perverse in her Productions, I assert her even then as wise and provident, as in her goodliest Works. For 'tis not then that Men complain of the World's Order, or abhor the Face of things, when they see various Interests mix'd and interfering; Natures subordinate, of different kinds, oppos'd one to another, and in their different Operations submitted, the higher to the lower. 'Tis on the contrary, from this Order of inferior and superior Things, that we admire the World's Beauty, founded thus on Contrarietys: whilst from such various and disagreeing Principles, a universal Concord is establish'd.\"","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Thus in the several Orders of terrestrial Forms, a Resignation is requir'd, a Sacrifice and mutual yielding of Natures one to another. The Vegetables by their Death sustain the Animals: and Animal Bodys dissolv'd, enrich the Earth, and raise again the vegetable World. The numerous Insects are reduc'd by the superior Kinds of Birds and Beasts: and these again are check'd by Man; who in his turn submits to other Natures, and resigns his Form a Sacrifice in common to the rest of Things. And if in Natures so little exalted or pre-eminent above each other, the Sacrifice of Interests can appear so just; how much more reasonably may all inferior Natures be subjected to the superior Nature of the World! That World, Palemon, which even now transported you, when the Sun's fainting Light gave way to these bright Constellations, and left you this wide System to contemplate.\"","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Here are those Laws which ought not, nor can submit to any thing below. The central Powers, which hold the lasting Orbs in their just Poize and Movement, must not be controul'd to save a fleeting Form, and rescue from the Precipice a puny Animal, whose brittle Frame, howe'er protected, must of it-self so soon dissolve.

'Tis then alone that monstrous Shapes are seen: Nature still working as before, and not perversly or erroneously; not faintly, or with feeble Endeavours; but o'erpower'd by a superior Rival, and by another Nature's justly conquering Force.\"","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Nor need we wonder, if the interior Form, the Soul and Temper, partakes of this occasional Deformity, and sympathizes often with its close Partner.

For mine or your own?\" \"For both,\" reply'd I. \"For tho I was like to be perfectly cur'd of my Scepticism; 'twas by what I thought worse, {Enthusiast.} downright Enthusiasm.

All was serene, soft, and harmonious. The manner of it was more after the pleasing Transports of those antient Poets you are often charm'd with, than after the fierce unsociable way of modern Zealots; those starch'd gruff Gentlemen, who guard Religion as Bullys do a Mistress, and give us the while a very indifferent Opinion of their Lady's Merit, and their own Wit, by adoring what they neither allow to be inspected by others, nor care themselves to examine in a fair light. But here I'll answer for it; there was nothing of Disguise or Paint. All was fair, open, and genuine, as Nature herself. 'Twas Nature he was in love with: 'Twas Nature he sung. And if any-one might be said to have a natural Mistress, my Friend certainly might, whose Heart was thus ingag'd. But Love, I found, was every-where the same. And tho the Object here was very fine, and the Passion it created very noble; yet Liberty, I thought, was finer than all: And I who never car'd to ingage in other Loves of the least continuance, was the more afraid, I told you, of this which had such a power with my poor Friend, as to make him appear the perfectest Enthusiast in the World, Ill-humour only excepted. For this was singular in him, \"That tho he had all of the Enthusiast, he had nothing of the Bigot. He heard every thing with Mildness and Delight; and bore with me when I treated all his Thoughts as visionary; and when, Sceptick-like, I unravel'd all his Systems.\"","subId":"19","id":"Shaftesbury.C.M.1.3.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Here was that Character and Description which so highly pleas'd you, that you wou'd hardly suffer me to come to a conclusion.
