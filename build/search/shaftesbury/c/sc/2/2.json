Knaves I know there are in Notion and Principle, as well as in Practice: who think all Honesty as well as Religion a mere Cheat; and by a very consistent reasoning, have resolv'd deliberately to do whatever by Power or Art they are able, for their private Advantage. But such as these never open themselves in Friendship to others. They have no such Passion for Truth, or Love for Mankind. They have no Quarrel with Religion or Morals; but know what use to make of both, upon occasion. If they ever discover their Principles, 'tis only at unawares. They are sure to preach Honesty, and go to Church.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.2.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"On the other side, the Gentlemen for whom I am apologizing, cannot however be call'd Hypocrites. They speak as ill of themselves as they possibly can. If they have hard thoughts of human Nature; 'tis a Proof still of their Humanity, that they give such warning to the World. If they represent Men by Nature treacherous and wild, 'tis out of care for Mankind; lest by being too tame and trusting, they shou'd easily be caught.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.2.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Impostors naturally speak the best of human Nature, that they may the easier abuse it. These Gentlemen, on the contrary, speak the worst; and had rather they themselves shou'd be censur'd with the rest, than that a Few shou'd by Imposture prevail over the Many. For 'tis Opinion of Goodness which creates Easiness of Trust: and by Trust we are betray'd to Power; our very Reason being thus captivated by those in whom we come insensibly to have an implicit Faith. But supposing one another to be by Nature such very Savages, we shall take care to come less in one another's power: and apprehending Power to be insatiably coveted by all, we shall the better fence against the Evil; not by giving all into one Hand (as the Champion of this Cause wou'd have us) but, on the contrary, by a right Division and Balance of Power, and by the Restraint of good Laws and Limitations, which may secure the publick Liberty.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.2.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Shou'd you therefore ask me, whether I really thought these Gentlemen were fully persuaded of the Principles they so often advance in Company? I shou'd tell you, That tho I wou'd not absolutely arraign the Gentlemens Sincerity; yet there was something of Mystery in the Case, more than was imagin'd. The Reason, perhaps, why Men of Wit delight so much to espouse these paradoxical Systems, is not in truth that they are so fully satisfy'd with 'em; but in a view the better to oppose some other Systems, which by their fair appearance have help'd, they think, to bring Mankind under Subjection. They imagine that by this general Scepticism, which they wou'd introduce, they shall better deal with the dogmatical Spirit which prevails in some particular Subjects. And when they have accustom'd Men to bear Contradiction in the main, and hear the Nature of Things disputed, at large; it may be safer, they conclude, to argue separately, upon certain nice Points in which they are not altogether so well satisfy'd. So that from hence, perhaps, you may still better apprehend why, in Conversation, the Spirit of Raillery prevails so much, and Notions are taken up for no reason besides their being odd, and out of the way.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.SC.2.2.4"},{"type":"note","content":"VOL.
