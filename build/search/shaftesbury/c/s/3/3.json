The Observers of Method generally make this the place of Recapitulation. Other Artists have substituted the Practice of Apology, or Extenuation. For the anticipating Manner of prefatory Discourse, is too well known, to work any surprizing effect in the Author's behalf: Preface being become only another word to signify Excuse. Besides that the Author is generally the most straiten'd in that preliminary Part, which on other accounts is too apt to grow voluminous. He therefore takes the advantage of his Corollary or Winding-up; and ends pathetically, by endeavouring in the softest manner to reconcile his Reader to those Faults which he chuses rather to excuse than to amend.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"General Practice has made this a necessary Part of Elegance, hardly to be pass'd over by any Writer. 'Tis the chief Stratagem by which he engages in personal Conference with his Reader; and can talk immoderately of Himself, with all the seeming Modesty of one who is the furthest from any selfish Views, or conceited Thoughts of his own Merit. There appears such a peculiar Grace and Ingenuity in the method of confessing Laziness, Precipitancy, Carelessness, or whatever other Vices have been the occasion of the Author's Deficiency; that it wou'd seem a Pity, had the Work it-self been brought to such Perfection, as to have left no room for the penitent Party to enlarge on his own Demerits. For from the multiplicity of these, he finds Subject to ingratiate himself with his Reader; who doubtless is not a little rais'd by this Submission of a confessing Author; and is ready, on these terms, to give him Absolution, and receive him into his good Grace and Humour.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the galante World, indeed, we easily find how far a Humility of this kind prevails. They who hope to rise by Merit, are likeliest to be disappointed in their Pretensions. The confessing Lover, who ascribes all to the Bounty of the Fair-one, meets his Reward the sooner, for having study'd less how to deserve it. For Merit is generally thought presumptuous, and suppos'd to carry with it a certain Assurance and Ease, with which a Mistress is not so well contented. The Claim of well-deserving seems to derogate from the pure Grace and Favour of the Benefactrice; who then appears to her-self most sovereign in Power, and likeliest to be obey'd without reserve, when she bestows her Bounty, where there is least Title, or Pretension.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus a certain Adoration of the Sex, which passes in our Age without the least Charge of Profaneness, or Idolatry, may, according to vulgar Imagination, serve to justify these galante Votarys, in the imitation of the real Religious and Devout. The method of Self-abasement may perhaps be thought the properest to make Approaches to the sacred Shrines: And the intire Resignation of Merit, in each Case, may be esteem'd the only ground of well-deserving. But what we allow to Heaven, or to the Fair, shou'd not, methinks, be made a Precedent, in favour of the World. Whatever Deference is due to that Body of Men whom we call Readers; we may be suppos'd to treat 'em with sufficient Honour, if with thorow Diligence, and Pains, we endeavour to render our Works perfect; and leave 'em to judg of the Performance, as they are able.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"However difficult or desperate it may appear in any Artist to endeavour to bring Perfection into his Work; if he has not at least the Idea of Perfection to give him Aim, he will be found very defective and mean in his Performance.

Hardly can I forbear making some Apology for my frequent Recourse to the Rules of common Artists, to the Masters of Exercise, to the Academys of Painters, Statuarys, and to the rest of the Virtuoso-Tribe. But in this I am so fully satisfy'd I have Reason on my side, that let Custom be ever so strong against me, I had rather repair to these inferior Schools, to search for Truth, and Nature; than to some other Places, where higher Arts and Sciences are profess'd.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I am persuaded that to be a Virtuoso (so far as befits a Gentleman) is a higher step towards the becoming a Man of Virtue and good Sense, than the being what in this Age we call a Scholar. For even rude Nature it-self, in its primitive Simplicity, is a better Guide to Judgment, than improv'd Sophistry, and pedantick Learning. The Faciunt, nae, intellegendo, ut nihil intellegant, will be ever apply'd by Men of Discernment and free Thought to such Logick, such Principles, such Forms and Rudiments of Knowledg, as are establish'd in certain Schools of Literature and Science. The case is sufficiently understood even by those who are unwilling to confess the Truth of it. Effects betray their Causes. And the known Turn and Figure of those Understandings, which sprout from Nurserys of this kind, give a plain Idea of what is judg'd on this occasion. 'Tis no wonder, if after so wrong a ground of Education, there appears to be such need of Redress, and Amendment, from that excellent School which we call the World. The mere Amusements of Gentlemen are found more improving than the profound Researches of Pedants. And in the Management of our Youth, we are forc'd to have recourse to the former; as an Antidote against the Genius peculiar to the latter. If the Formalists of this sort were erected into Patentees, with a sole Commission of Authorship; we shou'd undoubtedly see such Writing in our days, as wou'd either wholly wean us from all Books in general, or at least from all such as were the product of our own Nation, under such a subordinate and conforming Government.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"However this may prove, there can be no kind of Writing which relates to Men and Manners, where it is not necessary for the Author to understand Poetical and Moral Truth, the Beauty of Sentiments, the Sublime of Characters; and carry in his Eye the Model or Exemplar of that natural Grace, which gives to every Action its attractive Charm. If he has naturally no Eye, or Ear, for these interior Numbers; 'tis not likely he shou'd be able to judg better of that exterior Proportion and Symmetry of Composition, which constitutes a legitimate Piece.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Cou'd we once convince our-selves of what is in it-self so evident; \"That in the very nature of Things there must of necessity be the Foundation of a right and wrong Taste, as well in respect of inward Characters and Features, as of outward Person, Behaviour, and Action\"; we shou'd be far more asham'd of Ignorance and wrong Judgment in the former, than in the latter of these Subjects. Even in the Arts, which are mere Imitations of that outward Grace and Beauty, we not only confess a Taste; but make it a part of refin'd Breeding, to discover, amidst the many false Manners and ill Styles, the true and natural one, which represents the real Beauty and Venus of the kind. 'Tis the like moral Grace, and Venus, which discovering it-self in the Turns of Character, and the variety of human Affection, is copy'd by the writing Artist. If he knows not this Venus, these Graces, nor was ever struck with the Beauty, the Decorum of this inward kind, he can neither paint advantageously after the Life, nor in a feign'd Subject, where he has full scope. For never can he, on these Terms, represent Merit and Virtue, or mark Deformity and Blemish. Never can he with Justice and true Proportion assign the Boundarys of either Part, or separate the distant Characters. The Schemes must be defective, and the Draughts confus'd, where the Standard is weakly establish'd, and the Measure out of use. Such a Designer, who has so little Feeling of these Proportions, so little Consciousness of this Excellence, or these Perfections, will never be found able to describe a perfect Character; or, what is more according to Art, \"express the Effect and Force of this Perfection, from the Result of various and mixt Characters of Life.\" And thus the Sense of inward Numbers, the Knowledg and Practice of the social Virtues, and the Familiarity and Favour of the moral Graces, are essential to the Character of a deserving Artist, and just Favourite of the Muses. Thus are the Arts and Virtues mutually Friends: and thus the Science of Virtuoso's, and that of Virtue it-self, become, in a manner, one and the same.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One who aspires to the Character of a Man of Breeding and Politeness, is careful to form his Judgment of Arts and Sciences upon right Models of Perfection.

However antiquated, rough, or dismal they may appear to him, at first sight; he resolves to view 'em over and over, till he has brought himself to relish 'em, and finds their hidden Graces and Perfections. He takes particular care to turn his Eye from every thing which is gaudy, luscious, and of a false Taste.

If Civility and Humanity be a Taste; if Brutality, Insolence, Riot, be in the same manner a Taste; who, if he cou'd reflect, wou'd not chuse to form himself on the amiable and agreeable, rather than the odious and perverse Model? Who wou'd not endeavour to force Nature as well in this respect, as in what relates to a Taste or Judgment in other Arts and Sciences?

Otherwise, I like at this hour, but dislike the next. I shall be weary of my Pursuit, and, upon experience, find little Pleasure in the main, if my Choice and Judgment in it be from no other Rule than that single one, because I please. Grotesque and monstrous Figures often please. Cruel Spectacles, and Barbaritys are also found to please, and, in some Tempers, to please beyond all other Subjects. But is this Pleasure right?

How is it possible I shou'd thus come to taste the Beautys of an Italian Master, or of a Hand happily form'd on Nature and the Antients? 'Tis not by Wantonness and Humour that I shall attain my End, and arrive at the Enjoyment I propose. The Art it-self is severe: the Rules rigid.

To this Correction of Humour and Formation of a Taste, our Reading, if it be of the right sort, must principally contribute. Whatever Company we keep; or however polite and agreeable their Characters may be, with whom we converse, or correspond: if the Authors we read are of another kind, we shall find our Palat strangely turn'd their way. We are the unhappier in this respect, for being Scholars; if our Studys be ill chosen. Nor can I, for this reason, think it proper to call a Man well-read who reads many Authors; since he must of necessity have more ill Models, than good; and be more stuff'd with Bombast, ill Fancy, and wry Thought; than fill'd with solid Sense, and just Imagination.","subId":"13","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But notwithstanding this hazard of our Taste, from a Multiplicity of Reading; we are not, it seems, the least scrupulous in our choice of Subject. We read whatever comes next us. What was first put into our hand, when we were young, serves us afterwards for serious Study, and wise Research, when we are old. We are many of us, indeed, so grave as to continue this Exercise of Youth thro' our remaining Life. The exercising-Authors of this kind have been above describ'd, in the beginning of this Treatise. The Manner of Exercise is call'd Meditation, and is of a sort so solemn and profound, that we dare not so much as thorowly examine the Subject on which we are bid to meditate. This is a sort of Task-Reading, in which a Taste is not permitted. How little soever we take of this Diet; 'tis sufficient to give full Exercise to our grave Humour, and allay the Appetite towards further Research and solid Contemplation. The rest is Holiday, Diversion, Play, and Fancy. We reject all Rule; as thinking it an Injury to our Diversions, to have regard to Truth or Nature: without which, however, nothing can be truly agreeable, or entertaining; much less, instructive, or improving. Thro' a certain Surfeit taken in a wrong kind of serious Reading, we apply our-selves, with full content, to the most ridiculous. The more remote our Pattern is from any thing moral or profitable; the more Freedom and Satisfaction we find in it. We care not how Gothick or Barbarous our Models are; what ill-design'd or monstrous Figures we view; or what false Proportions we trace, or see describ'd in History, Romance, or Fiction. And thus our Eye and Ear is lost. Our Relish or Taste must of necessity grow barbarous, whilst Barbarian Customs, Savage Manners, Indian Wars, and Wonders of the Terra Incognita, employ our leisure Hours, and are the chief Materials to furnish out a Library.","subId":"14","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"These are in our present Days, what Books of Chivalry were, in those of our Forefathers.

For my own part, I have ever thought this sort of Men to be in general more credulous, tho after another manner, than the mere Vulgar. Besides what I have observ'd in Conversation with the Men of this Character, I can produce many anathematiz'd Authors, who if they want a true Israelitish Faith, can make amends by a Chinese or Indian one. If they are short in Syria, or the Palestine; they have their full measure in America, or Japan. Historys of Incas or Iroquois, written by Fryers and Missionarys, Pirates and Renegades, Sea-Captains and trusty Travellers, pass for authentick Records, and are canonical, with the Virtuoso's of this sort. Tho Christian Miracles may not so well satisfy 'em; they dwell with the highest Contentment on the Prodigys of Moorish and Pagan Countrys. They have far more Pleasure in hearing the monstrous Accounts of monstrous Men, and Manners; than the politest and best Narrations of the Affairs, the Governments, and Lives of the wisest and most polish'd People.","subId":"16","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis the same Taste which makes us prefer a Turkish History to a Grecian, or a Roman; an Ariosto to a Virgil; and a Romance, or Novel, to an Iliad. We have no regard to the Character or Genius of our Author: nor are so far curious, as to observe how able he is in the Judgment of Facts, or how ingenious in the Texture of his Lyes. For Facts unably related, tho with the greatest Sincerity, and good Faith, may prove the worst sort of Deceit: And mere Lyes, judiciously compos'd, can teach us the Truth of Things, beyond any other manner. But to amuse our-selves with such Authors as neither know how to lye, nor tell truth, discovers a Taste, which methinks one shou'd not be apt to envy. Yet so enchanted we are with the travelling Memoirs of any casual Adventurer; that be his Character, or Genius, what it will, we have no sooner turn'd over a Page or two, than we begin to interest our-selves highly in his Affairs. No sooner has he taken Shipping at the Mouth of the Thames, or sent his Baggage before him to Gravesend, or Buoy in the Nore, than strait our Attention is earnestly taken up. If in order to his more distant Travels, he takes some Part of Europe in his way; we can with patience hear of Inns and Ordinarys, Passage-Boats and Ferrys, foul and fair Weather; with all the Particulars of the Author's Diet, Habit of Body, his personal Dangers and Mischances, on Land, and Sea. And thus, full of desire and hope, we accompany him, till he enters on his great Scene of Action, and begins by the Description of some enormous Fish, or Beast. From monstrous Brutes he proceeds to yet more monstrous Men.

For so the Mind forebodes, on every such unusual Sight or Hearing. Fate, Destiny, or the Anger of Heaven, seems denoted, and as it were delineated, by the monstrous Birth, the horrid Fact, or dire Event. For this reason the very Persons of such Relators or Tale-tellers, with a small help of dismal Habit, sutable Countenance and Tone, become sacred and tremendous in the Eyes of Mortals, who are thus addicted from their Youth. The tender Virgins, losing their natural Softness, assume this tragick Passion, of which they are highly susceptible, especially when a sutable kind of Eloquence and Action attends the Character of the Narrator. A thousand Desdemona' s are then ready to present themselves, and wou'd frankly resign Fathers, Relations, Country-men, and Country it-self, to follow the Fortunes of a Hero of the black Tribe.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But whatever monstrous Zeal, or superstitious Passion, the Poet might foretel, either in the Gentlemen, Ladys, or common People, of an after Age; 'tis certain that as to Books, the same Moorish Fancy, in its plain and literal sense, prevails strongly at this present time.

In such a Situation of Mind, we can hardly endure to see Heathen treated as Heathen, and the Faithful made the Executioners of the Divine Wrath.

But shou'd he venture farther, into the Lives and Characters of the Patriarchs, the holy Matrons, Heroes and Heroines of the chosen Seed; shou'd he employ the sacred Machine, the Exhibitions and Interventions of Divinity, according to Holy Writ, to support the Action of his Piece; he wou'd soon find the Weakness of his pretended Orthodox Muse, and prove how little those Divine Patterns were capable of human Imitation, or of being rais'd to any other Majesty, or Sublime, than that in which they originally appear.","subId":"33","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.3.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Theology, or Theogony, of the Heathens cou'd admit of such different Turns and figurative Expressions, as suted the Fancy and Judgment of each Philosopher or Poet.

Academys for Exercises, so useful to the Publick, and essential in the Formation of a genteel and liberal Character, are unfortunately neglected. Letters are indeed banish'd, I know not where, in distant Cloisters and unpractis'd Cells, as our Poet has it, confin'd to the Commerce and mean Fellowship of bearded Boys. The sprightly Arts and Sciences are sever'd from Philosophy, which consequently must grow dronish, insipid, pedantick, useless, and directly opposite to the real Knowledg and Practice of the World and Mankind. Our Youth accordingly seem to have their only Chance between two widely different Roads; either that of Pedantry and School-Learning, which lies amidst the Dregs and most corrupt part of antient Literature; or that of the fashionable illiterate World, which aims merely at the Character of the fine Gentleman, and takes up with the Foppery of modern Languages and foreign Wit. The frightful Aspect of the former of these Roads makes the Journey appear desperate and impracticable. Hence that Aversion so generally conceiv'd against a learned Character, wrong turn'd, and hideously set out, under such Difficultys, and in such seeming Labyrinths, and mysterious Forms. As if a Homer or a Xenophon imperfectly learnt, in raw Years, might not afterwards, in a riper Age, be study'd, as well in a Capital City and amidst the World, as at a College, or Country-Town! Or as if a Plutarch, a Tully, or a Horace cou'd not accompany a young Man in his Travels, at a Court, or (if occasion were) even in a Camp! The Case is not without Precedent. Leisure is found sufficient for other Reading of numerous modern Translations, and worse Originals, of Italian or French Authors, who are read merely for Amusement. The French indeed may boast of some legitimate Authors of a just Relish, correct, and without any mixture of the affected or spurious kinds; the false Tender, or the false Sublime; the conceited Jingle, or the ridiculous Point. They are such Genius's as have been form'd upon the natural Model of the Antients, and willingly own their Debt to those great Masters.

[Antidotus, a pupil of Euphranor, was more painstaking than prolific, and was austere in his colouring. . . . Athenion of Maronea is compared with Nicias, but greatly preferred to him. He was a pupil of Glaucion the Corinthian, rather gloomy in colouring, yet pleasant in his gloom, so that his cultivation comes out in his very painting. . . . Had he not died young, no one could be compared with him. . . . Aristolaus, son and pupil of Pausias, was one of the most austere of painters. . . . Lately too we had Amulius, a severe and serious painter. . . . He used only to paint a few hours a day, but that very seriously, for he always wore full dress, even on his scaffolding.‚ÄîPliny, H. N. xxxv. (cc. 37, 40) 119‚Äì137.] One of the mortal Symptoms upon which Pliny pronounces the sure Death of this noble Art, not long survivor to him, was what belong'd in common to all the other perishing Arts after the Fall of Liberty; I mean the Luxury of the Roman Court, and the Change of Taste and Manners naturally consequent to such a Change of Government and Dominion. This excellent, learned, and polite Critick represents to us the false Taste springing from the Court it-self, and from that Opulence, Splendor, and Affectation of Magnificence and Expence proper to the Place. Thus in the Statuary and Architecture then in vogue, nothing cou'd be admir'd beside what was costly in the mere Matter or Substance of the Work. Precious Rock, rich Metal, glittering Stones, and other luscious Ware, poisonous to Art, came every day more into request; and were impos'd, as necessary Materials, on the best Masters. 'Twas in favour of these Court-Beautys and gaudy Appearances, that all good Drawing, just Design, and Truth of Work began to be despis'd. Care was taken to procure from distant Parts, the most gorgeous splendid Colours, of the most costly Growth or Composition: not such as had been us'd by Apelles and the great Masters, who are justly severe, loyal, and faithful to their Art. This newer Colouring our Critick calls the florid kind. The Materials were too rich to be furnish'd by the Painter, but were bespoke or furnish'd at the cost of the Person who employ'd him; (quos Dominus pingenti praestat.) The other he calls the austere kind. And thus, says he, \"Rerum, non Animi pretiis excubatur: The Cost, and not the Life, and Art, is study'd.\" He shews, on the contrary, what care Apelles took to subdue the florid Colours, by a darkening Varnish; ut eadem res, says he, nimis floridis coloribus Austeritatem occult√® daret. And he says just before, of some of the finest Pieces of Apelles, \"That they were wrought in four Colours only.\" So great and venerable was SIMPLICITY held among the Antients, and so certain was the Ruin of all true Elegance in Life or Art, where this Mistress was once quitted or contemn'd!
