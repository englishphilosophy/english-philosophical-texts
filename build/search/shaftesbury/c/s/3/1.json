For according to the Strain of modern Politeness; 'tis not an ordinary Violation of Truth, which can afford a Tribute sufficient to answer any common degree of Merit. Now 'tis well known that the Gentlemen whose Merit lies towards Authorship, are unwilling to make the least abatement on the foot of this Ceremonial. One wou'd wonder therefore to find 'em so entirely satisfy'd with a Form of Praise, which in plain sense amounts to no more than a bare Affirmative, \"That they have in some manner differ'd from themselves, and are become somewhat worse or better, than their common rate.\" For if the vilest Writer grows viler than ordinary, or exceeds his natural pitch on either side, he is justly said to exceed, or go beyond himself.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We find in the same manner, that there is no expression more generally us'd in a way of Compliment to great Men and Princes, than that plain one, which is so often verify'd, and may be safely pronounc'd for Truth, on most occasions; \"That they have acted like themselves, and sutably to their own Genius and Character.\" The Compliment, it must be own'd, sounds well. No one suspects it. For what Person is there who in his Imagination joins not something worthy and deserving with his true and native Self, as oft as he is refer'd to it, and made to consider, Who he is? Such is the natural Affection of all Mankind towards moral Beauty and Perfection, that they never fail in making this Presumption in behalf of themselves: \"That by Nature they have something estimable and worthy in respect of others of their Kind; and that their genuine, true, and natural Self, is, as it ought to be, of real value in Society, and justly honourable for the sake of its Merit, and good Qualitys.\" They conclude therefore they have the height of Praise allotted 'em, when they are assur'd by any-one, that they have done nothing below themselves, or that in some particular Action, they have exceeded the ordinary Tenor of their Character.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus is every-one convinc'd of the Reality of a better Self, and of the Cult or Homage which is due to It. The misfortune is, we are seldom taught to comprehend this Self, by placing it in a distinct View from its Representative or Counterfeit. In our holy Religion, which for the greatest part is adapted to the very meanest Capacitys, 'tis not to be expected that a Speculation of this kind shou'd be openly advanc'd. 'Tis enough that we have Hints given us of a nobler Self, than that which is commonly suppos'd the Basis and Foundation of our Actions. Self-Interest is there taken, as it is vulgarly conceiv'd. Tho on the other side there are, in the most sacred Characters, Examples given us of the highest Contempt of all such interested Views, of a Willingness to suffer without recompence for the sake of others, and of a desire to part even with Life and Being it-self, on account of what is generous and worthy. But in the same manner as the celestial Phaenomena are in the Sacred Volumes generally treated according to common Imagination, and the then current System of Astronomy and natural Science; so the moral Appearances are in many places preserv'd without Alteration, according to vulgar Prejudice, and the general Conception of Interest and Self-good. Our real and genuine Self is sometimes suppos'd that ambitious one which is fond of Power and Glory; sometimes that childish one which is taken with vain Shew, and is to be invited to Obedience by promise of finer Habitations, precious Stones and Metals, shining Garments, Crowns, and other such dazling Beautys, by which another Earth, or material City, is represented.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must be own'd, that even at that time, when a greater and purer Light disclos'd it-self in the chosen Nation; their natural Gloominess appear'd still, by the great difficulty they had to know themselves, or learn their real Interest, after such long Tutorage and Instruction from above. The Simplicity of that People must certainly have been very great; when the best Doctrine cou'd not go down without a Treat, and the best Disciples had their Heads so running upon their Loaves, that they were apt to construe every divine Saying in a Belly-Sense, and thought nothing more self-constituent than that inferior Receptacle. Their Taste in Morals cou'd not fail of being sutable to this extraordinary Estimation of themselves. No wonder if the better and nobler Self was left as a Mystery to a People, who of all human Kind were the most grosly selfish, crooked and perverse. So that it must necessarily be confess'd, in honour of their divine Legislators, Patriots, and Instructors; that they exceeded all others in Goodness and Generosity; since they cou'd so truly love their Nation and Brethren, such as they were; and cou'd have so generous and disinterested Regards for those, who were in themselves so sordidly interested and undeserving.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But whatever may be the proper Effect or Operation of Religion, 'tis the known Province of Philosophy to teach us our-selves, keep us the self-same Persons, and so regulate our governing Fancys, Passions, and Humours, as to make us comprehensible to our selves, and knowable by other Features than those of a bare Countenance. For 'tis not certainly by virtue of our Face merely, that we are our-selves. 'Tis not WE who change, when our Complexion or Shape changes. But there is that, which being wholly metamorphos'd and converted, WE are thereby in reality transform'd and lost.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Shou'd an intimate Friend of ours, who had endur'd many Sicknesses, and run many ill Adventures while he travel'd thro' the remotest parts of the East, and hottest Countrys of the South, return to us so alter'd in his whole outward Figure, that till we had for a time convers'd with him, we cou'd not know him again to be the same Person; the matter wou'd not seem so very strange, nor wou'd our concern on this account be very great. But shou'd a like Face and Figure of a Friend return to us with Thoughts and Humours of a strange and foreign Turn, with Passions, Affections, and Opinions wholly different from any thing we had formerly known; we shou'd say in earnest, and with the greatest Amazement and Concern, that this was another Creature, and not the Friend whom we once knew familiarly. Nor shou'd we in reality attempt any renewal of Acquaintance or Correspondence with such a Person, tho perhaps he might preserve in his Memory the faint Marks or Tokens of former Transactions which had pass'd between us.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When a Revolution of this kind, tho not so total, happens at any time in a Character; when the Passion or Humour of a known Person changes remarkably from what it once was; 'tis to Philosophy we then appeal. 'Tis either the Want or Weakness of this Principle, which is charg'd on the Delinquent. And on this bottom it is, that we often challenge our-selves, when we find such variation in our Manners; and observe that it is not always the same Self, nor the same Interest we have in view; but often a direct contrary-one, which we serve still with the same Passion and Ardour. When from a noted Liberality we change perhaps to as remarkable a Parsimony; when from Indolence and Love of Rest we plunge into Business; or from a busy and severe Character, abhorrent from the tender Converse of the fair Sex, we turn on a sudden to a contrary Passion, and become amorous or uxorious: we acknowledg the Weakness; and charging our Defect on the general want of Philosophy, we say (sighing) \"That, indeed, we none of us truly know ourselves.\" And thus we recognize the Authority and proper Object of Philosophy; so far at least, that tho we pretend not to be compleat Philosophers, we confess, \"That as we have more or less of this Intelligence or Comprehension of our-selves, we are accordingly more or less truly Men, and either more or less to be depended on, in Friendship, Society, and the Commerce of Life.\"","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Fruits of this Science are indeed the fairest imaginable; and, upon due trial, are found to be as well relish'd, and of as good savour with Mankind. But when invited to the Speculation, we turn our Eyes on that which we suppose the Tree, 'tis no wonder if we slight the Gardenership, and think the manner of Culture a very contemptible Mystery. \"Grapes, 'tis said, are not gather'd from Thorns; nor Figs from Thistles.\" Now if in the literate World there be any choking Weed, any thing purely Thorn or Thistle, 'tis in all likelihood that very kind of Plant which stands for Philosophy in some famous Schools. There can be nothing more ridiculous than to expect that Manners or Understanding shou'd sprout from such a Stock. It pretends indeed some relation to Manners, as being definitive of the Natures, Essences, and Propertys of Spirits; and some relation to Reason, as describing the Shapes and Forms of certain Instruments imploy'd in the reasoning Art. But had the craftiest of Men, for many Ages together, been imploy'd in finding out a method to confound Reason, and degrade the Understanding of Mankind; they cou'd not perhaps have succeeded better, than by the Establishment of such a Mock-Science.","subId":"8","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I knew once a notable Enthusiast of the itinerant kind, who being upon a high Spiritual Adventure in a Country where prophetick Missions are treated as no Jest, was, as he told me, committed a close Prisoner, and kept for several months where he saw no manner of Light. In this Banishment from Letters and Discourse, the Man very wittily invented an Amusement much to his purpose, and highly preservative both of Health and Humour. It may be thought perhaps, that of all Seasons or Circumstances here was one the most sutable to our oft-mention'd practice of Soliloquy; especially since the Prisoner was one of those whom in this Age we usually call Philosophers, a Successor of Paracelsus, and a Master in the occult Sciences. But as to Moral Science, or any thing relating to Self-converse, he was a mere Novice. To work therefore he went, after a different method. He tun'd his natural Pipes not after the manner of a Musician, to practice what was melodious and agreeable in Sounds, but to fashion and form all sorts of articulate Voices the most distinctly that was possible. This he perform'd by strenuously exalting his Voice, and essaying it in all the several Dispositions and Configurations of his Throat and Mouth. And thus bellowing, roaring, snarling, and otherwise variously exerting his Organs of Sound, he endeavour'd to discover what Letters of the Alphabet cou'd best design each Species, or what new Letters were to be invented, to mark the undiscover'd Modifications. He found, for instance, the Letter A to be a most genuine Character, an original and pure Vowel, and justly plac'd as principal in the front of the alphabetick Order. For having duly extended his under Jaw to its utmost distance from the upper; and by a proper Insertion of his Fingers provided against the Contraction of either Corner of his Mouth; he experimentally discover'd it impossible for human Tongue under these Circumstances to emit any other Modification of Sound than that which was describ'd by this primitive Character. The Vowel O was form'd by an orbicular Disposition of the Mouth; as was aptly delineated in the Character it-self. The Vowel U by a parallel Protrusion of the Lips. The other Vowels and Consonants by other various Collisions of the Mouth, and Operations of the active Tongue upon the passive Gum or Palat. The Result of this profound Speculation and long Exercise of our Prisoner, was a Philosophical Treatise, which he compos'd when he was set at liberty. He esteem'd himself the only Master of Voice and Language on the account of this his radical Science, and fundamental Knowledg of Sounds. But whoever had taken him to improve their Voice, or teach 'em an agreeable or just manner of Accent or Delivery, wou'd, I believe, have found themselves considerably deluded.","subId":"9","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not that I wou'd condemn as useless this speculative Science of Articulation. It has its place, no doubt, among the other Sciences, and may serve to Grammar, as Grammar serves to Rhetorick, and to other Arts of Speech and Writing. The Solidity of Mathematicks, and its Advantage to Mankind, is prov'd by many effects in those beneficial Arts and Sciences which depend on it: tho Astrologers, Horoscopers, and other such, are pleas'd to honour themselves with the Title of Mathematicians. As for Metaphysicks, and that which in the Schools is taught for Logick or for Ethicks; I shall willingly allow it to pass for Philosophy, when by any real effects it is prov'd capable to refine our Spirits, improve our Understandings, or mend our Manners. But if the defining material and immaterial Substances, and distinguishing their Propertys and Modes, is recommended to us, as the right manner of proceeding in the Discovery of our own Natures, I shall be apt to suspect such a Study as the more delusive and infatuating, on account of its magnificent Pretension.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Study of Triangles and Circles interferes not with the Study of Minds. Nor does the Student in the mean while suppose himself advancing in Wisdom, or the Knowledg of Himself or Mankind. All he desires, is to keep his Head sound, as it was before. And well, he thinks indeed, he has come off, if by good fortune there be no Crack made in it. As for other Ability or Improvement in the Knowledg of human Nature or the World; he refers himself to other Studys and Practice. Such is the Mathematician's Modesty and good Sense. But for the Philosopher, who pretends to be wholly taken up in considering his higher Facultys, and examining the Powers and Principles of his Understanding; if in reality his Philosophy be foreign to the Matter profess'd; if it goes beside the mark, and reaches nothing we can truly call our Interest or Concern; it must be somewhat worse than mere Ignorance or Idiotism. The most ingenious way of becoming foolish, is by a System. And the surest Method to prevent good Sense, is to set up something in the room of it. The liker any thing is to Wisdom, if it be not plainly the thing it-self, the more directly it becomes its opposite.","subId":"11","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One wou'd expect it of these Physiologists and Searchers of Modes and Substances, that being so exalted in their Understandings, and inrich'd with Science above other Men, they shou'd be as much above 'em in their Passions and Sentiments. The Consciousness of being admitted into the secret Recesses of Nature, and the inward Resources of a human Heart, shou'd, one wou'd think, create in these Gentlemen a sort of Magnanimity, which might distinguish 'em from the ordinary Race of Mortals. But if their pretended Knowledg of the Machine of this World, and of their own Frame, is able to produce nothing beneficial either to the one or to the other; I know not to what purpose such a Philosophy can serve, except only to shut the door against better Knowledg, and introduce Impertinence and Conceit with the best Countenance of Authority.","subId":"12","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis hardly possible for a Student, but more especially an Author, who has dealt in Ideas, and treated formally of the Passions, in a way of natural Philosophy, not to imagine himself more wise on this account, and more knowing in his own Character, and the Genius of Mankind.

Nor is this a wonder. The Speculation in a manner bespeaks the Practice. There needs no formal Deduction to make this evident.

Shou'd a Philosopher, after the same manner, employing himself in the Study of human Nature, discover only, what Effects each Passion wrought upon the Body; what change of Aspect or Feature they produc'd; and in what different manner they affected the Limbs and Muscles; this might possibly qualify him to give Advice to an Anatomist or a Limner, but not to Mankind or to Himself: Since according to this Survey he consider'd not the real Operation or Energy of his Subject, nor contemplated the Man, as real Man, and as a human Agent; but as a Watch or common Machine.","subId":"15","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"The Passion of Fear (as a modern Philosopher informs me) determines the Spirits to the Muscles of the Knees, which are instantly ready to perform their Motion; by taking up the Legs with incomparable Celerity, in order to remove the Body out of harm's way.\"—Excellent Mechanism!
