He may ask perhaps, \"Why a Writer for Self-entertainment shou'd not keep his Writings to himself, without appearing in Publick, or before the World.\"","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In answer to this I shall only say, that for appearing in Publick, or before the World, I do not readily conceive what our worthy Objector may understand by it. I can call to mind, indeed, among my Acquaintance, certain Merchant-Adventurers in the Letter-Trade, who in correspondence with their Factor-Bookseller, are enter'd into a notable Commerce with the World. They have directly, and in due Form of Preface, and Epistle Dedicatory, sollicited the Publick, and made Interest with Friends for Favour and Protection on this account. They have ventur'd, perhaps, to join some great Man's Reputation with their own; having obtain'd his Permission to address a Work to him, on presumption of its passing for something considerable in the eyes of Mankind. One may easily imagine that such patroniz'd and avow'd Authors as these, wou'd be shreudly disappointed if the Publick took no notice of their Labours. But for my own part, 'tis of no concern to me, what regard the Publick bestows on my Amusements; or after what manner it comes acquainted with what I write for my private Entertainment, or by way of Advice to such of my Acquaintance as are thus desperately embark'd.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis requisite, that my Friends, who peruse these Advices, shou'd read 'em in better Characters than those of my own Hand-writing. And by good luck I have a very fair Hand offer'd, which may save me the trouble of re-copying, and can readily furnish me with as many handsom Copys as I wou'd desire, for my own and Friends Service. I have not, indeed, forbid my Amanuensis the making as many as he pleases for his own Benefit. What I write is not worth being made a Mystery. And if it be worth any one's purchasing; much good may do the Purchaser.

I am conscious of no additional Virtue, or dangerous Quality, from having lain at any time under the weight of that alphabetick Engine call'd the Press. I know no Conjuration in it, either with respect to Church, or State. Nor can I imagine why the Machine shou'd appear so formidable to Scholars, and renown'd Clerks; whose very Mystery and Foundation depends on the Letter-Manufacture. To allow Benefit of Clergy, and to restrain the Press, seems to me to have something of Cross-purpose in it. I can hardly think that the Quality of what is written can be alter'd by the Manner of Writing; or that there can be any harm in a quick way of copying fair, and keeping Copys alike. Why a Man may not be permitted to write with Iron as well as Quill, I can't conceive; or how a Writer changes his Capacity, by this new Dress, any more than by the wear of Wove-Stockins, after having worn no other Manufacture than the Knit.","subId":"4","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"SO MUCH for my Reader; if perchance I have any besides the Friend or two above-mention'd. For being engag'd in Morals, and induc'd to treat so rigorous a Subject as that of Self-examination; I naturally call to mind the extreme Delicacy and Tenderness of modern Appetites, in respect of the Philosophy of this kind. What Distaste possibly may have arisen from some medicinal Doses of a like nature, administer'd to raw Stomachs, at a very early Age, I will not pretend to examine. But whatever Manner in Philosophy happens to bear the least resemblance to that of Catechism, cannot, I'm persuaded, of it-self, prove very inviting. Such a smart way of questioning our-selves in our Youth, has made our Manhood more averse to the expostulatory Discipline. And tho the metaphysical Points of our Belief are by this method, with admirable Care and Caution, instill'd into tender Minds; yet the manner of this anticipating Philosophy, may make the After-work of Reason, and the inward Exercise of the Mind, at a riper Age, proceed the more heavily, and with greater reluctance.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must needs be a hard Case with us, after having pass'd so learned a Childhood, and been instructed in our own and other higher Natures, Essences, incorporeal Substances, Personalitys, and the like; to condescend at riper Years to ruminate and con over this Lesson a second time. 'Tis hard, after having, by so many pertinent Interrogatorys, and decisive Sentences, declar'd Who and What we are; to come leisurely, in another view, to inquire concerning our real Self, and End, the Judgment we are to make of Interest, and the Opinion we shou'd have of Advantage and Good: which is what must necessarily determine us in our Conduct, and prove the leading Principle of our Lives.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Can we bear looking a-new into these Mysterys?

If there be a Pleasure therefore of this kind; why not indulge it? Or what harm wou'd there be, supposing it shou'd grow greater by Indulgence? If I am lazy, and indulge my-self in the languid Pleasure; I know the harm, and can foresee the Drone. If I am luxurious, I know the harm of this also, and have the plain prospect of the Sot. If Avarice be my Pleasure; the End, I know, is being a Miser. But if Honesty be my Delight, I know no other consequence from indulging such a Passion, than that of growing better natur'd, and enjoying more and more the Pleasures of Society.

So far are they from such forwardness, that they often stand as at a distance; suffering us to make the first advance, and contenting themselves with discovering a Side-face, or bestowing now and then a glance in a mysterious manner, as if they endeavour'd to conceal their Persons.","subId":"17","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One of the most dangerous of these Enchantresses appears in a sort of dismal Weed, with the most mournful Countenance imaginable; often casting up her Eyes, and wringing her Hands; so that 'tis impossible not to be mov'd by her, till her Meaning be consider'd, and her Imposture fully known. The Airs she borrows, are from the tragick Muse Melpomene. Nor is she in her own Person any way amiable or attractive. Far from it. Her Art is to render her-self as forbidding as possible; that her Sisters may by her means be the more alluring. And if by her tragick Aspect, and melancholy Looks, she can persuade us that Death (whom she represents) is such a hideous Form; she conquers in behalf of the whole fantastick Tribe of wanton, gay, and fond Desires. Effeminacy and Cowardice instantly prevail. The poorest Means of Life grow in repute, when the Ends and just Conditions of it are so little known, and the Dread of parting with it, rais'd to so high a degree. The more eagerly we grasp at Life, the more impotent we are in the Enjoyment of it. By this Avidity, its very Lees and Dregs are swallow'd. The Ideas of sordid Pleasure are advanc'd. Worth, Manhood, Generosity, and all the nobler Opinions and Sentiments of honest Good, and virtuous Pleasure, disappear, and fly before this Queen of Terrors.","subId":"18","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis a mighty Delight which a sort of Counter-Philosophers take in seconding this Phantom, and playing her upon our Understandings, whenever they wou'd take occasion to confound 'em.

By the help of this tragick Actress, they gain a fairer Audience for the luxurious Fancys; and give their Erato' s, and other playsom Muses a fuller Scope in the support of Riot and Debauch. The gloomy Prospect of Death becomes the Incentive to Pleasures of the lowest Order. Ashes and Shade, the Tomb and Cypress, are made to serve as Foils to Luxury.

She supports her Interest by this childish Bugbear; and, like a Mother by her Infant, is hugg'd so much the closer by her Votary, as the Fear presses him, and grows importunate. She invites him to live fast, according to her best measure of Life. And well she may. Who wou'd not willingly make Life pass away as quickly as was possible; when the nobler Pleasures of it were already lost or corrupted by a wretched Fear of Death? The intense Selfishness and Meanness which accompanys this Fear, must reduce us to a low ebb of Enjoyment; and in a manner bring to nothing that main Sum of satisfactory Sensations, by which we vulgarly rate the Happiness of our private Condition and Fortune.","subId":"21","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But see! A lovely Form advances to our Assistance, introduc'd by the prime Muse, the beauteous Calliope! She shews us what real Beauty is, and what those Numbers are, which make Life perfect, and bestow the chief Enjoyment. She sets Virtue before our Eyes, and teaches us how to rate Life, from the Experience of the most heroick Spirits. She brings her Sisters Clio and Urania to support her. From the former she borrows whatever is memorable in History, and antient Time, to confront the tragick Specter, and shew the fix'd Contempt which the happiest and freest Nations, as well as single Heroes, and private Men worthy of any Note, have ever express'd for that Impostress. From the latter she borrows what is sublimest in Philosophy, to explain the Laws of Nature, the Order of the Universe, and represent to us the Justice of accompanying this amiable Administration. She shews us, that by this just Compliance we are made happiest: and that the measure of a happy Life is not from the fewer or more Suns we behold, the fewer or more Breaths we draw, or Meals we repeat; but from the having once liv'd well, acted our Part handsomly, and made our Exit chearfully, and as became us.","subId":"22","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus we retain on Virtue's side the noblest Party of the Muses. Whatever is august amongst those Sisters, appears readily in our behalf. Nor are the more jocund Ladys wanting in their Assistance, when they act in the Perfection of their Art, and inspire some better Genius's in this kind of Poetry. Such were the nobler Lyricks, and those of the latter, and more refin'd Comedy of the Antients. The Thalia' s, the Polyhymnia' s, the Terpsychore' s, the Euterpe' s willingly join their Parts; and being alike interested in the Cause of Numbers, are with regret employ'd another way, in favour of Disorder. Instead of being made Syrens to serve the Purposes of Vice, they wou'd with more delight accompany their elder Sisters, and add their Graces and attractive Charms to what is most harmonious, Muse-like, and Divine in human Life. There is this difference only between these and the more heroick Dames; that they can more easily be perverted, and take the vicious Form. For what Person of any Genius or masterly Command in the poetick Art, cou'd think of bringing the Epick or Tragick Muse to act the Pandar, or be subservient to Effeminacy and Cowardice? 'Tis not against Death, Hazards or Toils, that Tragedy and the heroick Fable are pointed. 'Tis not mere Life which is here exalted, or has its Price enhanc'd. On the contrary, its Calamitys are expos'd: the Disorders of the Passions set to view: Fortitude recommended: Honour advanc'd: the Contempt of Death plac'd as the peculiar Note of every generous and happy Soul; and the tenacious Love of Life, as the truest Character of an abject Wretch.","subId":"23","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Is it so hard to die?","subId":"24","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis not to be imagin'd how easily we deal with the deluding Apparitions and false Ideas of Happiness and Good; when this frightful Specter of Misery and Ill, is after this manner well laid, and by honest Magick conjur'd down; so as not to give the least assistance to the other tempting Forms. This is that occult Science, or sort of Counter-Necromancy, which instead of Ghastliness and Horror, inspires only what is gentle and humane, and dispels the imposing Phantoms of every kind.

The Prince grew sullen; turn'd the Discourse; abhor'd the Profanation offer'd to his Sovereign-Empress; deliver'd up his Thoughts to her again with deep Devotion, and fell to conquering with all his Might. The Sound of Victory rung in his Ears. Laurels and Crowns play'd before his Eyes.—What was this beside Giddiness and Dream? Appearances uncorrected? \"Worlds dancing? Phantoms playing?\"","subId":"39","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.39"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"\"Seas of Milk, and Ships of Amber!\"","subId":"40","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.40"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis easy to bring the Hero's Case home to our-selves; and see, in the ordinary Circumstances of Life, how Love, Ambition, and the gayer Tribe of Fancys (as well as the gloomy and dark Specters of another sort) prevail over our Mind. 'Tis easy to observe how they work on us, when we refuse to be before-hand with 'em, and bestow repeated Lessons on the encroaching Sorceresses. On this it is, that our offer'd Advice, and Method of Soliloquy depends. And whether this be of any use towards making us either wiser, or happier; I am confident, it must help to make us wittier and politer. It must, beyond any other Science, teach us the Turns of Humour and Passion, the Variety of Manners, the Justness of Characters, and Truth of Things; which when we rightly understand, we may naturally describe. And on this depends chiefly the Skill and Art of a good Writer. So that if to write well be a just pretence to Merit; 'tis plain, that Writers, who are apt to set no small Value on their Art, must confess there is something valuable in this self-examining Practice, and Method of inward Colloquy.","subId":"41","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.3.2.41"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for the Writer of these Papers (as modern Authors are pleas'd modestly to style themselves) he is contented, for his part, to take up with this Practice, barely for his own proper Benefit; without regard to the high Function or Capacity of Author.
