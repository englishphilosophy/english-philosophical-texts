For in a free Country, such as ours, there is not any Order or Rank of Men, more free than that of Writers: who if they have real Ability and Merit, can fully right themselves when injur'd; and are ready furnish'd with Means, sufficient to make themselves consider'd by the Men in highest Power.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nor shou'd I suspect the Genius of our Writers, or charge 'em with Meanness and Insufficiency on the account of this Low-spiritedness which they discover; were it not for another sort of Fear, by which they more plainly betray themselves, and seem conscious of their own Defect. The Criticks, it seems, are formidable to 'em. The Criticks are the dreadful Specters, the Giants, the Enchanters, who traverse and disturb 'em in their Works. These are the Persecutors, for whose sake they are ready to hide their heads; begging rescue and protection of all good People; and flying in particular to the Great, by whose Favour they hope to be defended from this merciless examining Race. \"For what can be more cruel, than to be forc'd to submit to the rigorous Laws of Wit, and write under such severe Judges as are deaf to all Courtship, and can be wrought upon by no Insinuation or Flattery to pass by Faults, and pardon any Transgression of Art?\"","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To judg indeed of the Circumstances of a modern Author, by the Pattern of his Prefaces, Dedications, and Introductions, one wou'd think that at the moment when a Piece of his was in hand, some Conjuration was forming against him, some diabolical Powers drawing together to blast his Work, and cross his generous Design. He therefore rouzes his Indignation, hardens his Forehead, and with many furious Defiances and Avant-Satans! enters on his Business; not with the least regard to what may justly be objected to him in a way of Criticism; but with an absolute Contempt of the Manner and Art it-self.","subId":"3","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.2.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Avaunt, ye uninitiated crowd, was in its time, no doubt, a generous Defiance.

They became rather affected in endeavouring to discover the pains they had taken to be correct. They were glad to insinuate how laboriously, and with what expence of Time, they had brought the smallest Work of theirs (as perhaps a single Ode or Satir, an Oration or Panegyrick) to its perfection.

This the Prince of Criticks assures us to have been the Manner of the earliest Poets, before the Age of Homer; or till such time as this Father-Poet came into Repute, who depos'd that spurious Race, and gave rise to a legitimate and genuine Kind.

For so the same Prince of Criticks sufficiently informs us. And 'tis highly worth remarking, what this mighty Genius and Judg of Art declares concerning Tragedy; that whatever Idea might be form'd of the utmost Perfection of this kind of Poem, it cou'd in practice rise no higher than it had been already carry'd in his time; \"Having at length (says he) attain'd its Ends, and being apparently consummate in it-self\": But for Comedy, it seems, 'twas still in hand.

As perfect as were those Wits in Style and Language; and as fertile in all the Varietys and Turns of Humour; yet the Truth of Characters, the Beauty of Order, and the simple Imitation of Nature, were in a manner wholly unknown to 'em; or thro' Petulancy, or Debauch of Humour, were, it seems, neglected and set aside.

The Affairs of this free People being in the Increase; and their Ability and Judgment every day improving, as Letters and Arts advanc'd; they wou'd of course find in themselves a Strength of Nature, which by the help of good Ferments, and a wholesom opposition of Humours, wou'd correct in one way whatever was excessive, or peccant (as Physicians say) in another. Thus the florid and over-sanguine Humour of the high Style was allay'd by something of a contrary nature. The Comick Genius was apply'd, as a kind of Caustick, to those Exuberances and Fungus's of the swoln Dialect, and magnificent manner of Speech.

If upon a Change of Government, as during the Usurpation of the Thirty, or when that Nation was humbled at any time, either by a Philip, an Alexander, or an Antipater, they had been forc'd against their Wills, to enact such Laws as these; 'tis certain they wou'd have soon repeal'd 'em, when those Terrors were remov'd, as they soon were, and the People restor'd to their former Libertys. For notwithstanding what this Nation suffer'd outwardly, by several shocks receiv'd from foreign States; notwithstanding the Dominion and Power they lost abroad, they preserv'd the same Government at home. And how passionately interested they were in what concern'd their Diversions and publick Spectacles; how jealous and full of Emulation in what related to their Poetry, Wit, Musick, and other Arts, in which they excel'd all other Nations; is well known to Persons who have any comprehension of antient Manners, or been the least conversant in History.","subId":"27","id":"Shaftesbury.C.S.2.2.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Nothing therefore cou'd have been the Cause of these publick Decrees, and of this gradual Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit, beside the real Reform of Taste and Humour in the Commonwealth or Government it-self.

As this Intelligence in Life and Manners grew greater in that experienc'd People, so the Relish of Wit and Humour wou'd naturally in proportion be more refin'd. Thus Greece in general grew more and more polite; and as it advanc'd in this respect, was more averse to the obscene buffooning manner. The Athenians still went before the rest, and led the way in Elegance of every kind. For even their first Comedy was a Refinement upon some irregular Attempts which had been made in that dramatick way.

We no sooner hear the Theme propounded, the Subject divided and subdivided, (with first of the first, and so forth, as Order requires) than instantly we begin a Strife with Nature, who otherwise might surprize us in the soft Fetters of Sleep; to the great Disgrace of the Orator, and Scandal of the Audience. The only Manner left, in which Criticism can have its just Force amongst us, is the antient Comick; of which kind were the first Roman Miscellanys, or Satirick Pieces: a sort of original Writing of their own, refin'd afterwards by the best Genius, and politest Poet of that Nation; who, notwithstanding, owns the Manner to have been taken from the Greek Comedy above-mention'd.

Whilst Comedy went on, improving still to the second and third degree; Tragedy finish'd its course under Euripides: whom, tho our great Author criticizes with the utmost Severity in his Poeticks, yet he plainly enough confesses to have carry'd the Style of Tragedy to its full Height and Dignity. For as to the Reformation which that Poet made in the use of the sublime and figurative Speech, in general; see what our discerning Author says in his Rhetoricks: where he strives to shew the Impertinence and Nauseousness of the florid Speakers, and such as understood not the Use of the simple and natural Manner. \"The just Masters and right Managers of the Poetick or High Style, shou'd learn (says he) how to conceal the Manner as much as possible.\" Διὸ δει̑ λανθάνειν ποιου̑ντας, καὶ μὴ δοκει̑ν λέγειν πεπλασμένως, ἀλλὰ πεφυκότως. του̑το γὰρ πιθανόν, ἐκει̑νο δὲ τοὐναντίον.
