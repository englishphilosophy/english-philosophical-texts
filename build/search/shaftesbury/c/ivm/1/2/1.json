For to what End in Nature many things, even whole Species of Creatures, refer; or to what purpose they serve; will be hard for any-one justly to determine: But to what End the many Proportions and various Shapes of Parts in many Creatures actually serve; we are able, by the help of Study and Observation, to demonstrate, with great exactness.","subId":"1","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We know that every Creature has a private Good and Interest of his own; which Nature has compel'd him to seek, by all the Advantages afforded him, within the compass of his Make. We know that there is in reality a right and a wrong State of every Creature; and that his right-one is by Nature forwarded, and by himself affectionately sought. There being therefore in every Creature a certain Interest or Good; {Interest or End in Creatures.} there must be also a certain End, to which every thing in his Constitution must naturally refer. To this End, if any thing, either in his Appetites, Passions, or Affections, be not conducing, but the contrary; we must of necessity own it ill to him. And in this manner he is ill, with respect to himself; as he certainly is, with respect to others of his kind, when any such Appetites or Passions make him any-way injurious to them. {Interest of the Species.} Now, if by the natural Constitution of any rational Creature, the same Irregularitys of Appetite which make him ill to Others, make him ill also to Him-self; and if the same Regularity of Affections, which causes him to be good in one sense, causes him to be good also in the other; {Goodness.} then is that Goodness by which he is thus useful to others, a real Good and Advantage to himself. And thus Virtue and Interest may be found at last to agree.","subId":"2","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Of this we shall consider particularly in the latter part of our Inquiry.

For instance, if an Animal has the Proportions of a Male, it shews he has relation to a Female. And the respective Proportions both of the Male and Female will be allow'd, doubtless, to have a joint-relation to another Existence and Order of things beyond themselves. So that the Creatures are both of 'em to be consider'd as Parts of another System: which is that of a particular Race or Species of living Creatures, who have some one common Nature, or are provided for, by some one Order or Constitution of things subsisting together, and co-operating towards their Conservation, and Support.","subId":"5","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Animal System.} In the same manner, if a whole Species of Animals contribute to the Existence or Well-being of some other; then is that whole Species, in general, a Part only of some other System.","subId":"6","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For instance; To the Existence of the Spider, that of the Fly is absolutely necessary.

The Web and Wing are suted to each other. And in the Structure of each of these Animals, there is as apparent and perfect a relation to the other, as in our own Bodys there is a relation of Limbs and Organs; or, as in the Branches or Leaves of a Tree, we see a relation of each to the other, and all, in common, to one Root and Trunk.","subId":"7","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the same manner are Flies also necessary to the Existence of other Creatures, both Fowls and Fish.

And if it be allow'd, that there is in like manner a System of all Things, and a Universal Nature; {Universal System.} there can be no particular Being or System which is not either good or ill in that general one of the Universe: For if it be insignificant and of no use, it is a Fault or Imperfection, and consequently ill in the general System.","subId":"10","id":"Shaftesbury.C.IVM.1.2.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Therefore if any Being be wholly and really Ill, it must be ill with respect to the Universal System; and then the System of the Universe is ill, or imperfect.
