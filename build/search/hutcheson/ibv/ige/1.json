Had we no Sense of Good distinct from the Advantage or Interest arising from the external Senses, and the Perceptions of Beauty and Harmony; our Sensations and Affections toward a fruitful Field, or commodious Habitation, would be much the same with what we have toward a generous Friend, or any noble Character; for both are or may be advantageous to us: And we should no more admire any Action, or love any Person in a distant Country, or Age, whose Influence could not extend to us, than we love the Mountains of Peru, while we are unconcern'd in the Spanish Trade. We should have the same Sentiments and Affections toward inanimate Beings, which we have toward rational Agents, which yet every one knows to be false. Upon Comparison, we say, \"Why should we approve or love inanimate Beings? They have no Intention of Good to us, or to any other Person; their Nature makes them fit for our Uses, which they neither know nor study to serve.

Do not inanimate Objects promote our Advantage, as well as benevolent Persons, who do us Offices of Kindness and Friendship? Should we not then have the same endearing Approbation of both? or only the same cold Opinion of Advantage in both?\" The Reason why it is not so, must be this, \"That we have a distinct Perception of Beauty, or Excellence in the kind Affections of rational Agents; whence we are determin'd to admire and love such Characters and Persons.\"","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{In Actions done to our selves.} Suppose we reap the same Advantage from two Men, one of whom serves us from an ultimate Desire of our Happiness, and Good-will toward us; the other from Views of Self-Interest, or by Constraint: both are in this Case equally beneficial or advantageous to us, and yet we shall have quite different Sentiments of them. We must then certainly have other Perceptions of moral Actions, than those of Advantage: And that Power of receiving these Perceptions may be call'd a Moral Sense, since the Definition agrees to it, viz. a Determination of the Mind, to receive any Idea from the Presence of an Object which occurs to us, independent on our Will.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Of Evil, Moral and Natural.} This perhaps will be equally evident from our Ideas of Evil, done to us designedly by a rational Agent. Our Senses of natural Good and Evil would make us receive, with equal Serenity and Composure, an Assault, a Buffet, an Affront from a Neighbour, a Cheat from a Partner, or Trustee, as we would an equal Damage from the Fall of a Beam, a Tile, or a Tempest; and we should have the same Affections and Sentiments on both Occasions. Villany, Treachery, Cruelty, would be as meekly resented as a Blast, or Mildew, or an overflowing Stream. But I fansy every one is very differently affected on these Occasions, tho' there may be equal natural Evil in both. Nay, Actions no way detrimental may occasion the strongest Anger and Indignation, if they evidence only impotent Hatred or Contempt. And, on the other hand, the Intervention of moral Ideas may prevent our Condemnation of the Agent, or bad moral Apprehension of that Action, which causes to us the greatest natural Evil. Thus the Opinion of Justice in any Sentence, will prevent all Ideas of moral Evil in the Execution, or Hatred toward the Magistrate, who is the immediate Cause of our greatest Sufferings.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{In Actions toward others.} In our Sentiments of Actions which affect ourselves, there is indeed a Mixture of the Ideas of natural and moral Good, which require some Attention to separate them. But when we reflect upon the Actions which affect other Persons only, we may observe the moral Ideas unmix'd with those of natural Good or Evil. For let it be here observ'd, that those Senses by which we perceive Pleasure in natural Objects, whence they are constituted Advantageous, could never raise in us any Desire of publick Good, but only of what was good to ourselves in particular. Nor could they ever make us approve an Action merely because of its promoting the Happiness of others. And yet, as soon as any Action is represented to us as flowing from Love, Humanity, Gratitude, Compassion, a Study of the good of others, and an ultimate Desire of their Happiness, altho' it were in the most distant Part of the World, or in some past Age, we feel Joy within us, admire the lovely Action, and praise its Author. And on the contrary, every Action represented as flowing from Ill-will, Desire of the Misery of others without View to any prevalent Good to the Publick, or Ingratitude, raises Abhorrence and Aversion.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is true indeed, that the Actions we approve in others, are generally imagin'd to tend to the natural Good of Mankind, or of some Parts of it. But whence this secret Chain between each Person and Mankind? How is my Interest connected with the most distant Parts of it? And yet I must admire Actions which show Good-will toward them, and love the Author. Whence this Love, Compassion, Indignation and Hatred toward even feign'd Characters, in the most distant Ages, and Nations, according as they appear kind, faithful, compassionate, or of the opposite Dispositions, toward their imaginary Contemporaries? If there is no moral Sense, which makes rational Actions appear Beautiful; if all Approbation be from the Interest of the Approver, \n\nWhat's Hecuba to us, or we to Hecuba?\n\n","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Moral Ideas not from Interest.} Some refin'd Explainers of Self-Love may tell us, \"That we approve or condemn Characters, according as we apprehend we should have been supported, or injur'd by them, had we liv'd in their Days.\" But how obvious is the Answer, if we only observe, that had we no Sense of moral Good in Humanity, Mercy, Faithfulness, why should not Self-Love, and our Sense of natural Good engage us always to the victorious Side, and make us admire and love the successful Tyrant, or Traitor? Why do not we love Sinon, or Pyrrhus, in the [Æneid]? for had we been Greeks, these two would have been very advantageous Characters. Why are we affected with the Fortunes of Priamus, Polites, Choroebus or Æneas? Would not the Parsimony of a Miser be as advantageous to his Heir, as the Generosity of a worthy Man is to his Friend? And cannot we as easily imagine ourselves Heirs to Misers, as the Favourites of Heroes? Why don't we then approve both alike? It is plain we have some secret Sense which determines our Approbation without regard to Self-Interest; otherwise we should always favour the fortunate Side without regard to Virtue, and suppose ourselves engaged with that Party.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As Mr. Hobbes explains all the Sensations of Pity by our Fear of the like Evils, when by Imagination we place ourselves in the Case of the Sufferers; so others explain all Approbation and Condemnation of Actions in distant Ages or Nations, by a like Effort of Imagination: We place ourselves in the Case of others, and then discern an imaginary private Advantage or Disadvantage in these Actions. But as his Account of Pity will never explain how the Sensation increases, according to the apprehended Worth of the Sufferer, or according to the Affection we formerly had to him; since the Sufferings of any Stranger may suggest the same Possibility of our suffering the like: So this Explication will never account for our high Approbation of brave unsuccessful Attempts, which we see prove detrimental both to the Agent, and to those for whose Service they were intended; here there is no private Advantage to be imagined. Nor will it account for our Abhorrence of such Injuries as we are incapable of suffering. Sure, when a Man abhors the Attempt of the young Tarquin, he does not imagine that he has chang'd his Sex like Cæneus. And then, when one corrects his Imagination, by remembring his own Situation, and Circumstances, we find the moral Approbation and Condemnation continues as lively as it was before, tho' the Imagination of Advantage is gone.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Suppose any great Destruction occasion'd by mere Accident, without any Design, or Negligence of the Person who casually was the Author of it: This Action might have been as disadvantageous to us as design'd Cruelty, or Malice; but who will say he has the same Idea of both Actions, or Sentiments of the Agents? Thus also an easy, indolent Simplicity, which exposes a Man of Wealth as a Prey to others, may be as advantageous a Disposition as the most prudent Generosity, to those he converses with; and yet our Sentiments of this latter Temper are far nobler than of the former. \"Whence then this Difference?\"","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And farther, Let us make a Supposition, which perhaps is not far from Matter of Fact, to try if we cannot approve even disadvantageous Actions, and perceive moral Good in them. A few ingenious Artisans, persecuted in their own Country, flee to ours for Protection; they instruct us in Manufactures which support Millions of Poor, increase the Wealth of almost every Person in the State, and make us formidable to our Neighbours. In a Nation not far distant from us, some resolute Burgomasters, full of Love to their Country, and Compassion toward their Fellow-Citizens, opprest in Body and Soul by a Tyrant and Inquisition, with indefatigable Diligence, publick Spirit, and Courage, support a tedious perilous War against the Tyrant, and form an industrious Republick, which rivals us in Trade, and almost in Power. All the World sees whether the former or the latter have been more advantageous to us: and yet let every Man consult his own Breast, which of the two Characters he has the most agreeable Idea of? whether of the useful Refugee, or the publick-spirited Burgomaster, by whose Love to his own Country, we have often suffer'd in our Interests? And I am confident he will find some other Foundation of Esteem than Advantage, and will see a just Reason, why the Memory of our Artisans is so obscure among us, and yet that of our Rivals is immortal.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Self-Love not the Ground of Approbation.} Some Moralists, who will rather twist Self-Love into a thousand Shapes, than allow any other Principle of Approbation than Interest, may tell us, \"That whatever profits one Part without detriment to another, profits the Whole, and then some small Share will redound to each Individual; that those Actions which tend to the Good of the Whole, if universally perform'd, would most effectually secure to each Individual his own Happiness; and that consequently, we may approve such Actions, from the Opinion of their tending ultimately to our own Advantage.\"","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We need not trouble these Gentlemen to shew by their nice Train of Consequences, and Influences of Actions by way of Precedent in particular Instances, that we in this Age reap any Advantage from Orestes's killing the treacherous Ægysthus, or from the Actions of Codrus or Decius.

For Self-Interest will recommend Men to us only according to the Good they do to our Selves, and not give us high Ideas of publick Good, but in proportion to our Share of it. But must a Man have the Reflection of Cumberland or Puffendorf, to admire Generosity, Faith, Humanity, Gratitude? Or reason so nicely to apprehend the Evil in Cruelty, Treachery, Ingratitude? Do not the former excite our Admiration, and Love, and Study of Imitation, where-ever we see them, almost at first View, without any such Reflection, and the latter, our Contempt, and Abhorrence?

Should any one advise us to wrong a Minor, or Orphan, or to do an ungrateful Action, toward a Benefactor; we at first View abhor it: Assure us that it will be very advantageous to us, propose even a Reward; our Sense of the Action is not alter'd.

That we suppose the Deity will reward them.\" This will be more fully consider'd hereafter: At present it is enough to observe, that many have high Notions of Honour, Faith, Generosity, Justice, who have scarce any Opinions about the Deity, or any Thoughts of future Rewards; and abhor any thing which is treacherous, cruel, or unjust, without any regard to future Punishments.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.1.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But farther, tho' these Rewards and Punishments, may make my own Actions appear advantageous to me, yet they would never make me approve, and love another Person for the like Actions, whose Merit would not be imputed to me.

But no Interest to myself, will make me approve an Action as morally Good, which without that Interest to myself, would have appear'd morally evil; if upon computing its whole Effects, it appears to produce as great a Moment of Good in the Whole, when it is not beneficial to me, as it did before, when it was. In our Sense of moral Good or Evil, our own private Advantage or Loss is of no more moment, than the Advantage or Loss of a third Person, to make an Action appear Good or Evil. This Sense therefore cannot be over-balanc'd by Interest. How ridiculous an Attempt would it be, to engage a Man by Rewards or Thretnings into a good Opinion of an Action, which was contrary to his moral Notions?

The Quality approved by our moral Sense is conceived to reside in the Person approved, and to be a Perfection and Dignity in him: Approbation of another's Virtue is not conceived as making the Approver happy, or virtuous, or worthy, tho' 'tis attended with some samll Pleasure. Virtue is then called amiable or lovely, from its raising Good-will or Love in Spectators toward the Agent; and not from the Agent's perceiving the virtuous Temper to be advantageous to him, or desiring to obtain it under that View. A virtuous Temper is called good or beatifick, not that it is always attended with Pleasure in the Agent; much less that some small Pleasure attends the Contemplation of it in the Approver: but from this, that every Spectator is persuaded that the reflex Acts of the virtuous Agent upon his own Temper will give him the highest Pleasures.
