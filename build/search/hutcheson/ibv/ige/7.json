This moral Sense of Excellence in every Appearance, or Evidence of Benevolence. It remains to be explain'd, how we acquire more particular Ideas of Virtue and Vice, abstracting from any Law, Human, or Divine.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Obligation.} If any one ask, Can we have any Sense of Obligation, abstracting from the Laws of a Superior? We must answer according to the various Senses of the word Obligation. If by Obligation we understand a Determination, without regard to our own Interest, to approve Actions, and to perform them; which Determination shall also make us displeas'd with our selves, and uneasy upon having acted contrary to it: in this meaning of the word Obligation, there is naturally an Obligation upon all Men to Benevolence; and they are still under its Influence, even when by false, or partial Opinions of the natural Tendency of their Actions, this moral Sense leads them to Evil; unless by long inveterate Habits it be exceedingly weaken'd; for it scarce seems possible wholly to extinguish it. Or, which is to the same purpose, this internal Sense, and Instinct of Benevolence, will either influence our Actions, or make us very uneasy and dissatisfy'd; and we shall be conscious, that we are in a base unhappy State, even without considering any Law whatsoever, or any external Advantages lost, or Disadvantages impending from its Sanctions. And farther, there are still such Indications given us of what is in the whole beneficent, and what not, as may probably discover to us the true Tendency of every Action; and let us see, some time or other, the evil Tendency of what upon a partial View appear'd good: or if we have no Friends so faithful as to admonish us, the Persons injur'd will not fail to upbraid us. So that no Mortal can secure to himself a perpetual Serenity, Satisfaction, and Self-approbation, but by a serious Inquiry into the Tendency of his Actions, and a perpetual Study of universal Good, according to the justest Notions of it.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But if, by Obligation, we understand a Motive from Self-interest, sufficient to determine all those who duly consider it, and pursue their own Advantage wisely, to a certain Course of Actions; we may have a Sense of such an Obligation, by reflecting on this Determination of our Nature to approve Virtue, to be pleas'd and happy when we reflect upon our having done virtuous Actions, and to be uneasy when we are conscious of having acted otherwise; and also by considering how much superior we esteem the Happiness of Virtue to any other Enjoyment. We may likewise have a Sense of this sort of Obligation, by considering those Reasons which prove a constant Course of benevolent and social Actions, to be the most probable Means of promoting the natural Good of every Individual; as Cumberland and Puffendorf have prov'd: And all this without Relation to a Law.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But farther, if our moral Sense be suppos'd exceedingly weakened, and the selfish Passions grown strong, either thro' some general Corruption of Nature, or inveterate Habits; if our Understanding be weak, and we be often in danger of being hurry'd by our Passions into precipitate and rash Judgments, that malicious Actions shall promote our Advantage more than Beneficence; in such a Case, if it be inquir'd what is necessary to engage Men to beneficent Actions, or induce a steady Sense of an Obligation to act for the public Good; then, no doubt, \"A Law with Sanctions, given by a superior Being, of sufficient Power to make us happy or miserable, must be necessary to counterbalance those apparent Motives of Interest, to calm our Passions, and give room for the recovery of our moral Sense, or at least for a just View of our Interest.\"","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{How far Virtue can be taught.} Now the principal Business of the moral Philosopher is to shew, from solid Reasons, \"That universal Benevolence tends to the Happiness of the Benevolent, either from the Pleasures of Reflection, Honour, natural Tendency to engage the good Offices of Men, upon whose Aid we must depend for our Happiness in this World; or from the Sanctions of divine Laws discover'd to us by the Constitution of the Universe;\" that so no apparent Views of Interest may counteract this natural Inclination: but not to attempt proving, \"That Prospects of our own Advantage of any kind can raise in us the virtuous Benevolence toward others.\" Let the Obstacles from Self-Love be only remov'd, and Nature itself will incline us to Benevolence. Let the Misery of excessive Selfishness, and all its Passions, be but once explain'd, that so Self-Love may cease to counteract our natural Propensity to Benevolence; and when this noble Disposition gets loose from these Bonds of Ignorance, and false Views of Interest, it shall be assisted even by Self-Love, and grow strong enough to make a noble virtuous Character. Then he is to inquire, by Reflection upon human Affairs, what Course of Action does most effectually promote the universal Good, what universal Rules or Maxims are to be observ'd, and in what Circumstances the Reason of them alters, so as to admit Exceptions; that so our good Inclinations may be directed by Reason, and a just Knowledge of the Interests of Mankind. But Virtue itself, or good Dispositions of Mind, are not directly taught, or produc'd by Instruction; they must be originally implanted in our Nature by its great Author; and afterwards strengthen'd and confirm'd by our own Cultivation.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Objection.} We are often told, \"That there is no need of supposing such a Sense of Morality given to Men, since Reflection and Instruction would recommend the same Actions from Arguments of Self-Interest, and engage us, from the acknowledg'd Principle of Self-Love, to the Practice of them, without this unintelligible Determination to Benevolence, or the occult Quality of a moral Sense.\"","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Moral Sense, not from Reflection.} It is perhaps true, that Reflection and Reason might lead us to approve the same Actions as advantageous. But would not the same Reflection and Reason likewise generally recommend the same Meats to us, which our Taste represents as pleasant? And shall we thence conclude, that we have no Sense of Tasting, or that such a Sense is useless? No: The use is plain in both Cases. Notwithstanding the mighty Reason we boast of above other Animals, its Processes are too slow, too full of Doubt and Hesitation, to serve us in every Exigency, either for our own Preservation, without the external Senses, or to influence our Actions for the Good of the Whole, without this moral Sense. Nor could we be so strongly determin'd at all times to what is most conducive to either of these Ends, without these expeditious Monitors, and importunate Sollicitors; nor so nobly rewarded, when we act vigorously in Pursuit of these Ends, by the calm dull Reflections of Self-Interest, as by those delightful Sensations.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This natural Determination to approve and admire, or hate and dislike Actions, is, no doubt, an occult Quality. But is it any way more mysterious, that the Idea of an Action should raise Esteem or Contempt, than that the Motion or tearing of Flesh should give Pleasure or Pain; or the Act of Volition should move Flesh and Bones? In the latter Case, we have got the Brain, and elastic Fibres, and animal Spirits, and elastic Fluids, like the Indian's Elephant, and Tortoise, to bear the Burden of the Difficulty: but go one step farther, and you find the whole as difficult as at first, and equally a Mystery with this Determination to love and approve, or condemn and despise Actions and Agents, without any Views of Interest, as they appear benevolent, or the contrary.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When they offer it as a Presumption that there can be no such Sense, antecedent to all Prospect of Interest, \"That these Actions for the most part are really advantageous, one way or other, to the Actor, the Approver, or Mankind in general, by whose Happiness our own State may be some way made better;\" may we not ask, supposing the Deity intended to impress such a Sense of something amiable in Actions, (which is no impossible Supposition) What sort of Actions would a good God determine us to approve? Must we deny the possibility of such a Determination, if it did not lead us to admire Actions of no Advantage to Mankind, or to love Agents for their being eminent Triflers? If then the Actions which a wise and good God must determine us to approve, if he give us any such Sense at all, must be Actions useful to the Publick, this Advantage can never be a Reason against the Sense itself. After the same manner, we should deny all Revelation, which taught us good Sense, Humanity, Justice, and a rational Worship, because Reason and Interest confirm and recommend such Principles and Services; and should greedily embrace every Contradiction, Foppery, and Pageantry, as a truly divine Institution, without any thing humane, or useful to Mankind.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Moral Sense judges of Laws.} The Writers upon opposite Schemes, who deduce all Ideas of Good and Evil from the private Advantage of the Actor, or from Relation to a Law, and its Sanctions, either known from Reason or Revelation, are perpetually recurring to this moral Sense which they deny; not only in calling the Laws of the Deity just and good, and alledging Justice and Right in the Deity to govern us; but by using a Set of Words which import something different from what they will allow to be their only Meaning. Obligation, with them, is only such a Constitution, either of Nature, or some governing Power, as makes it advantageous for the Agent to act in a certain manner. Let this Definition be substituted, where-ever we meet with the words, ought, should, must, in a moral Sense, and many of their Sentences would seem very strange; as that the Deity must act rationally, must not, or ought not to punish the Innocent, must make the state of the Virtuous better than that of the Wicked, must observe Promises; substituting the Definition of the Words, must, ought, should, would make these Sentences either ridiculous, or very disputable.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But that our first Ideas of moral Good depend not on Laws, may plainly appear from our constant Inquirys into the Justice of Laws themselves; and that not only of human Laws, but of the divine. What else can be the Meaning of that universal Opinion, \"That the Laws of God are just, and holy, and good?\" Human Laws may be call'd good, because of their Conformity to the Divine. But to call the Laws of the supreme Deity good, or holy, or just, if all Goodness, Holiness, and Justice be constituted by Laws, or the Will of a Superior any way reveal'd, must be an insignificant Tautology, amounting to no more than this, \"That God wills what he wills.\"","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must then first be suppos'd, that there is something in Actions which is apprehended absolutely good; and this is Benevolence, or Desire of the publick natural Happiness of rational Agents; and that our moral Sense perceives this Excellence: and then we call the Laws of the Deity good, when we imagine that they are contriv'd to promote the publick Good in the most effectual and impartial manner. And the Deity is call'd good, in a moral Sense, when we apprehend that his whole Providence tends to the universal Happiness of his Creatures; whence we conclude his Benevolence, and Desire of their Happiness.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Some tell us, \"That the Goodness of the divine Laws consists in their Conformity to some essential Rectitude of his Nature.\" But they must excuse us from assenting to this, till they make us understand the Meaning of this Metaphor, essential Rectitude; and till we discern whether any thing more is meant by it than a perfectly wise, uniform, impartial Benevolence.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Difference between Constraint, and Obligation.} Hence we may see the Difference between Constraint and Obligation. There is indeed no Difference between Constraint, and the second Sense of the word Obligation, viz. a Constitution which makes an Action eligible from Self-Interest, if we only mean external Interest, distinct from the delightful Consciousness which arises from the moral Sense. The Reader need scarcely be told, that by Constraint, we do not understand an external Force moving our Limbs without our Consent; for in that Case we are not Agents at all; but that Constraint which arises from the threatening and presenting some Evil, in order to make us act in a certain manner. And yet there seems an universally acknowledg'd Difference between even this sort of Constraint and Obligation. We never say, we are oblig'd to do an Action which we count base, but we may be constrain'd to it: we never say that the divine Laws, by their Sanctions, constrain us, but oblige us; nor do we call Obedience to the Deity Constraint, unless by a Metaphor, tho' many own they are influenc'd by Fear of Punishments. And yet supposing an almighty evil Being should require, under grievous Penaltys, Treachery, Cruelty, Ingratitude, we would call this Constraint. The Difference is plainly this: When any Sanctions co-operate with our moral Sense, in exciting us to Actions which we count morally good, we say we are oblig'd; but when Sanctions of Rewards or Punishments oppose our moral Sense, then we say we are brib'd or constrain'd. In the former Case we call the Lawgiver good, as designing the publick Happiness; in the latter we call him evil, or unjust, for the suppos'd contrary Intention. But were all our Ideas of moral Good or Evil deriv'd solely from opinions of private Advantage or Loss in Actions, I see no possible Difference which could be made in the Meaning of these words.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Rights.} From this Sense too we derive our Ideas of Rights. Whenever it appears to us, that a Faculty of doing, demanding, or possessing any thing, universally allow'd in certain Circumstances, would in the Whole tend to the general Good, we say, that one in such Circumstances has a Right to do, possess, or demand that Thing. And according as this Tendency to the publick Good is greater or less, the Right is greater or less.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Perfect Rights.} The Rights call'd perfect, are of such Necessity to the publick Good, that the universal Violation of them would make human Life intolerable; and it actually makes those miserable, whose Rights are thus violated. On the contrary, to fulfil these Rights in every Instance, tends to the publick Good, either directly, or by promoting the innocent Advantage of a Part. Hence it plainly follows, \"That to allow a violent Defence, or Prosecution of such Rights, before Civil Government be constituted, cannot in any particular Case be more detrimental to the Publick, than the Violation of them with Impunity.\" And as to the general Consequences, the universal Use of Force in a State of Nature, in pursuance of perfect Rights, seems exceedingly advantageous to the Whole, by making every one dread any Attempts against the perfect Rights of others.","subId":"16","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Right of War, and Punishment.} This is the moral Effect which attends proper Injury, or a Violation of the perfect Rights of others, viz. A Right to War, and all Violence which is necessary to oblige the Injurious to repair the Damage, and give Security against such Offences for the future. This is the sole Foundation of the Rights of punishing Criminals, and of violent Prosecutions of our Rights, in a State of Nature. And these Rights, naturally residing in the Persons injur'd, or their voluntary, or invited Assistants, to use Force according to the Judgment of indifferent Arbitrators, being by the Consent of the Persons injur'd, transferr'd to the Magistrate in a Civil State, are the true Foundation of his Right of Punishment. Instances of perfect Rights are those to our Lives; to the Fruits of our Labours; to demand Performance of Contracts upon valuable Considerations, from Men capable of performing them; to direct our own Actions either for publick, or innocent private Good, before we have submitted them to the Direction of others in any measure: and many others of like Nature.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Imperfect Rights.} Imperfect Rights are such as, when universally violated, would not necessarily make Men miserable. These Rights tend to the Improvement and Increase of positive Good in any Society, but are not absolutely necessary to prevent universal Misery. The Violation of them only disappoints Men of the Happiness expected from the Humanity or Gratitude of others; but does not deprive Men of any Good which they had before. From this Description it appears, \"That a violent Prosecution of such Rights would generally occasion greater Evil than the Violation of them.\" Besides, the allowing of Force in such Cases would deprive Men of the greatest Pleasure in Actions of Kindness, Humanity, Gratitude; which would cease to appear amiable, when Men could be constrain'd to perform them. Instances of imperfect Rights are those which the Poor have to the Charity of the Wealthy; which all Men have to Offices of no Trouble or Expence to the Performer; which Benefactors have to returns of Gratitude, and such-like.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Violation of imperfect Rights only argues a Man to have such weak Benevolence, as not to study advancing the positive Good of others, when in the least opposite to his own: but the Violation of perfect Rights argues the injurious Person to be positively evil or cruel; or at least so immoderately selfish, as to be indifferent about the positive Misery and Ruin of others, when he imagines he can find his Interest in it. In violating the former, we shew a weak Desire of publick Happiness, which every small View of private Interest overbalances; but in violating the latter, we shew ourselves so intirely negligent of the Misery of others, that Views of increasing our own Good overcome all our Compassion toward their Sufferings. Now as the absence of Good is more easily born than the presence of Misery; so our good Wishes toward the positive Good of others, are weaker than our Compassion toward their Misery. He then who violates imperfect Rights, shews that his Self-Love overcomes only the Desire of positive Good to others; but he who violates perfect Rights, betrays such a selfish Desire of advancing his own positive Good, as overcomes all Compassion toward the Misery of others.","subId":"19","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{External Rights.} Beside these two sorts of Rights, there is a third call'd External; as when the doing, possessing, or demanding of any Thing, is really detrimental to the Publick in any particular Instance, as being contrary to the imperfect Right of another; but yet the universally denying Men this Faculty of doing, possessing, or demanding that Thing, or of using Force in Pursuance of it, would do more Mischief than all the Evils to be fear'd from the Use of this Faculty. And hence it appears, \"That there can be no Right to use Force in opposition even to external Rights, since it tends to the universal Good to allow Force in Pursuance of them.\"","subId":"20","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Civil Societys substitute Actions in Law, instead of the Force allow'd in the State of Nature.","subId":"21","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Instances of external Rights are these; that of a wealthy Miser to recal his Loan from the most industrious poor Tradesman at any time; that of demanding the Performance of a Covenant too burdensome on one Side; the Right of a wealthy Heir to refuse Payment of any Debts which were contracted by him under Age, without Fraud in the Lender; the Right of taking advantage of a positive Law, contrary to what was Equity antecedent to that Law; as when a register'd Deed takes Place of one not register'd, altho' prior to it, and known to be so before the second Contract.","subId":"22","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{What Rights can be opposite.} Now, whereas no Action, Demand, or Possession, can at once be either necessary to the publick Good, or conducive to it, and at the same time its contrary be either necessary or conducive to the same End; it follows, \"That there can be no Opposition of perfect Rights among themselves, of imperfect among themselves, or between perfect and imperfect Rights.\" But it may often tend to the publick Good, to allow a Right of doing, possessing, or demanding, and of using Force in Pursuance of it, while perhaps it would have been more humane and kind in any Person to have acted otherwise, and not have claim'd his Right. But yet a violent Opposition to these Rights would have been vastly more pernicious than all the Inhumanity in the Use of them. And therefore, tho' external Rights cannot be opposite among themselves; yet they may be opposite to imperfect Rights; but imperfect Rights, tho' violated, give no Right to Force. Hence it appears, \"That there can never be a Right to Force on both Sides, or a just War on both Sides at the same time.\"","subId":"23","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Rights alienable and unalienable.} There is another important Difference of Rights, according as they are Alienable, or Unalienable. To determine what Rights are alienable, and what not, we must take these two Marks:","subId":"24","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If the Alienation be within our natural Power, so that it be possible for us in Fact to transfer our Right; and if it be so, then,","subId":"25","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.25"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It must appear, that to transfer such Rights may serve some valuable Purpose.","subId":"26","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.26"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By the first Mark it appears, \"That the Right of private Judgment, or of our inward Sentiments, is unalienable;\" since we cannot command ourselves to think what either we ourselves, or any other Person pleases. So are also our internal Affections, which necessarily arise according to our Opinions of their Objects. By the second Mark it appears, \"That our Right of serving God, in the manner which we think acceptable, is not alienable;\" because it can never serve any valuable Purpose, to make Men worship him in a way which seems to them displeasing to him. The same way, a direct Right over our Lives or Limbs is not alienable to any Person; so that he might at Pleasure put us to death, or maim us. We have indeed a Right to hazard our Lives in any good Action which is of importance to the Publick; and it may often serve a most valuable End, to subject the Direction of such perilous Actions to the Prudence of others in pursuing a publick Good; as Soldiers do to their General, or to a Council of War: and so far this Right is alienable. These may serve as Instances to shew the Use of the two Marks of alienable Rights, which must both concur to make them so, and will explain the manner of applying them in other Cases.","subId":"27","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.27"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{The Foundation of Property.} That we may see the Foundation of some of the more important Rights of Mankind, let us observe, that probably nine Tenths, at least, of the things which are useful to Mankind, are owing to their Labour and Industry; and consequently, when once Men become so numerous, that the natural Product of the Earth is not sufficient for their Support, or Ease, or innocent Pleasure; a Necessity arises, for the Support of the increasing System, that such a Tenour of Conduct be observ'd, as shall most effectually promote Industry; and that Men abstain from all Actions which would have the contrary Effect. It is well known, that general Benevolence alone, is not a Motive strong enough to Industry, to bear Labour and Toil, and many other Difficultys which we are averse to from Self-Love. For the strengthning therefore our Motives to Industry, we have the strongest Attractions of Blood, of Friendship, of Gratitude, and the additional Motives of Honour, and even of external Interest. Self-Love is really as necessary to the Good of the Whole, as Benevolence; as that Attraction which causes the Cohesion of the Parts, is as necessary to the regular State of the Whole, as Gravitation. Without these additional Motives, Self-Love would generally oppose the Motions of Benevolence, and concur with Malice, or influence us to the same Actions which Malice would. \"That Tenour of Action then, which would take away the stronger Ties of Benevolence, or the additional Motives of Honour and Advantage, from our Minds, and so hinder us from pursuing industriously that Course which really increases the Good of the Whole, is evil; and we are oblig'd to shun it.\"","subId":"28","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.28"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"First then, the depriving any Person of the Fruits of his own innocent Labour, takes away all Motives to Industry from Self-Love, or the nearer Ties; and leaves us no other Motive than general Benevolence: nay, it exposes the Industrious as a constant Prey to the Slothful, and sets Self-Love against Industry. This is the Ground of our Right of Dominion and Property in the Fruits of our Labours; without which Right, we could scarce hope for any Industry, or any thing beyond the Product of uncultivated Nature. Industry will be confin'd to our present Necessitys, and cease when they are provided for; at least it will only continue from the weak Motive of general Benevolence, if we are not allow'd to store up beyond present Necessity, and to dispose of what is above our Necessitys, either in Barter for other kinds of Necessarys, or for the Service of our Friends or Familys. And hence appears the Right which Men have to lay up for the future, the Goods which will not be spoil'd by it; of alienating them in Trade; of Donation to Friends, Children, Relations: otherwise we deprive Industry of all the Motives of Self-Love, Friendship, Gratitude, and natural Affection. The same Foundation there is for the Right of Disposition by Testament. The Presumption of this Disposition is the Ground of the Right of Succession to the Intestate.","subId":"29","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.7.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The external Right of the Miser to his useless Hoards is founded also on this, That allowing Persons by Violence, or without Consent of the Acquirer, to take the Use of his Acquisitions, would discourage Industry, and take away all the Pleasures of Generosity, Honour, Charity, which cease when Men can be forc'd to these Actions.

This holds equally in evil Attempts.

But additional Interests, which were not necessary to have mov'd the Agent, such as the Rewards of a good Being for Actions which he would have undertaken without a Reward, do not diminish the Virtue. In this, however, no Mortal is capable of judging another: Nor do the Prospects of grateful Returns for Benefits which we would have conferr'd gratuitously, diminish the Generosity.

And on the other hand, when an equal Necessity to avoid Ruin requires it, the Subjects may justly resume the Powers ordinarily lodg'd in their Governors, or may counteract them. This Privilege of flagrant Necessity we all allow in Defence of the most perfect private Rights: And if publick Rights are of more extensive Importance, so are also publick Necessitys.

The Tie of Gratitude is stronger indeed than bare Benevolence; and therefore supposing two equally wise and good Beings, the one our Creator, and the other not, we should think ourselves more oblig'd to obey our Creator. But supposing our Creator malicious, and a good Being condescending to rescue us, or govern us better, with sufficient Power to accomplish his kind Intentions; his Right to govern would be perfectly good.

For if the Deity be really benevolent, or delights in the Happiness of others, he could not rationally act otherwise, or give us a moral Sense upon another Foundation, without counteracting his own benevolent Intentions. For even upon the Supposition of a contrary Sense, every rational Being must still have been solicitous in some degree about his own external Happiness: Reflection on the Circumstances of Mankind in this World would have suggested, that universal Benevolence, and a social Temper, or a certain Course of external Actions, would most effectually promote the external Good of every one, according to the Reasonings of Cumberland and Puffendorf; while at the same time this perverted Sense of Morality would have made us uneasy in such a Course, and inclin'd us to the quite contrary, viz.
