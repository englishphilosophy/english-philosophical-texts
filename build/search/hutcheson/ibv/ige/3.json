Nor shall we find any thing amiable in any Action whatsoever, where there is no Benevolence imagin'd; nor in any Disposition, or Capacity, which is not suppos'd applicable to, and design'd for, benevolent Purposes. Nay, as was before observ'd, the Actions which in Fact are exceedingly useful, shall appear void of moral Beauty, if we know they proceeded from no kind Intentions towards others; and yet an unsuccessful Attempt of Kindness, or of promoting publick Good, shall appear as amiable as the most successful, if it flow'd from as strong Benevolence.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Religion.} Hence those Affections which would lead us to do Good to our Benefactor, shall appear amiable, and the contrary Affections odious, even when our Actions cannot possibly be of any Advantage or Hurt to him. Thus a sincere Love and Gratitude toward our Benefactor, a chearful Readiness to do whatever he shall require, how burdensom soever, a hearty Inclination to comply with his Intentions, and Contentment with the State he has plac'd us in, are the strongest Evidences of Benevolence we can shew to such a Person; and therefore they must appear exceedingly amiable. And under these is included all the rational Devotion, or Religion toward a Deity apprehended as good, which we can possibly perform.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Gratitude.} We may here transiently observe one Circumstance in the Frame of our Nature, which is wonderfully adapted to promote Benevolence, viz. that as a Benefit conferr'd necessarily raises Gratitude in the Person who receives it, so the Expressions of this Gratitude, even from the meanest of Mankind, are wonderfully delightful to the Benefactor. Never were there any Mortals so poor, so inconsiderable, whose grateful Praise would not be some way delightful; and by whom we would not rather chuse to be belov'd than hated, if their Love no way evidenc'd us to be Partners in their Vices, or concern'd in their Meanness. And thus the most abject Person oblig'd is capable, and inclin'd to make no small Addition to our Happiness by his Love and Gratitude, when he is utterly incapable of any other Return, and when we expect none from him: Thus, \n\n——— A grateful Mind \n By owing owes not, and still pays, at once \n Indebted and discharg'd ——\n\n","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to external Performances of Religion, they are no doubt very various in different Nations and Ages; and Education may give Men Opinions, that certain Actions are pleasing, and others displeasing to the Deity: but then where-ever any external Rite of Worship is approv'd, there also it is look'd upon to proceed from Love toward the Deity, or some other Affection necessarily join'd with Love, as Reverence, Repentance, or Sorrow to have offended. So that the general Principle of Love is the Foundation of all the apparent moral Excellence, even in the most fantastick Rites of Worship which were ever approv'd. For as to Rites design'd only to appease a furious Being, no Mortal, I fansy, apprehends there is any Virtue, or Excellence in them; but that they are chosen only as the dishonourable Means of avoiding a greater Evil. Now as there are various speculative Opinions about what is acceptable to the Deity, it necessarily follows, \"That, accordingly, Practices, and Approbation, must be various; tho' all the moral Goodness of Actions is still presum'd to flow from Love.\"","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Social Virtues.} Again, that we may see how Benevolence is the Foundation of all apprehended Excellence in social Virtues, let us only observe, That amidst the Diversity of Sentiments on this Head among various Sects, this is still allow'd to be the way of deciding the Controversy about any disputed Practice, viz. to inquire whether this Conduct, or the contrary, will most effectually promote the publick Good. The Morality is immediately adjusted, when the natural Tendency, or Influence of the Action upon the universal natural Good of Mankind, is agreed upon. That which produces more Good than Evil in the Whole, is acknowledg'd good; and what does not, is counted evil. In this Case, we no other way regard the good of the Actor, or that of those who are thus inquiring, than as they make a Part of the great System.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In our late Debates about Passive Obedience, and the Right of Resistance in Defence of Privileges, the Point disputed among Men of Sense was, \"Whether universal Submission would probably be attended with greater natural Evils, than temporary Insurrections, when Privileges are invaded? and not, Whether what tended in the Whole to the publick natural Good, was also morally good?\" And if a divine Command was alledg'd in favour of the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, this would, no doubt, by its eternal Sanctions cast the ballance of natural Good to its own side, and determine our Election from Interest; and yet our Sense of the moral Good in Passive Obedience, would still be founded upon some Species of Benevolence, such as Gratitude toward the Deity, and Submission to his Will to whom we are so much oblig'd. But I fansy those, who believe the Deity to be good, would not rashly alledge such a Command, unless they also asserted, that the thing commanded did tend more to the universal Good, than the contrary, either by preventing the external Evils of Civil War, or by enuring Men to Patience, or some other Quality which they apprehended necessary to their everlasting Happiness. And were it not so, Passive Obedience might be recommended as an inglorious Method of escaping a greater Mischief, but could never have any thing morally amiable in it.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But let us quit the Disputes of the Learned, on whom, it may be alledg'd, Custom and Education have a powerful Influence; and consider upon what Grounds, in common Life, Actions are approv'd or condemn'd, vindicated or excus'd. We are universally asham'd to say an Action is just, because it tends to my Advantage, or to the Advantage of the Actor: And we as seldom condemn a beneficent kind Action, because it is not advantageous to us, or to the Actor. Blame and Censure are founded on a Tendency to publick Evil, or a Principle of private Malice in the Agent, or Neglect at least of the Good of others; on Inhumanity of Temper, or at least such strong Selfishness as makes the Agent careless of the Sufferings of others: and thus we blame and censure when the Action no way affects ourselves. All the moving and persuasive Vindications of Actions, which may, from some partial evil Tendency, appear evil, are taken from this, that they were necessary to some greater Good, which counterbalanc'd the Evil: \"Severity toward a few, is Compassion toward multitudes.—Transitory Punishments are necessary for avoiding more durable Evils.—Did not some suffer on such Occasions, there would be no living for honest Men\",—and such like. And even when an Action cannot be intirely justify'd, yet how greatly is the Guilt extenuated, if we can alledge; \"That it was only the Effect of Inadvertence without Malice, or of partial good Nature, Friendship, Compassion, natural Affection, or Love of a Party?\" All these Considerations shew, what is the universal Foundation of our Sense of moral Good, or Evil, viz. Benevolence toward others on one hand, and Malice, or even Indolence, and Unconcernedness about the apparent publick Evil on the other. And let it be here observ'd, that we are so far from imagining all Men to act only from Self-Love, that we universally expect in others a Regard for the Publick; and do not look upon the Want of this, as barely the Absence of moral Good, or Virtue, but even as positively evil and hateful.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Moral Evil not always Malice.} Contrarys may illustrate each other; let us therefore observe the general Foundation of our Sense of moral Evil more particularly. Disinterested Malice, or ultimate Desire of the Misery of others, is the highest pitch of what we count vitious; and every Action appears evil, which is imagin'd to flow from any degree of this Affection. Perhaps a violent Passion may hurry Men into it for a few Moments, and our rash angry Sentiments of our Enemys, may represent them as having such odious Dispositions; but it is very probable, from the Reasons offer'd above, that there is no such degree of Wickedness in human Nature, as in cold blood, to desire the Misery of others, when it is conceiv'd no way useful to our Interests.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The frequent, and seemingly unprovoked Cruelties of the Nero's and Domitian's, are often alledged in Opposition to all this; but perhaps unjustly. Such Tyrants are conscious that they are hated by all those whom the World repute virtuous, and they apprehend Danger from them: A Tyrant looks upon such Men as designing, artful, or ambitious, under a false Shew of Virtue. He imagines the surest Means of his own Safety is to appear terrible, and to deprive his Enemys of all Hopes of escaping by his Compassion. The Fame of Virtue in eminent Subjects is matter of Envy, and is a Reproach upon the Tyrant: It weakens his Power, and makes them dangerous to him. Power becomes the Object of Delight to the Tyrant; and in Ostentation of it, he may break through all Regards to Justice and Humanity. Habits of Cruelty can be acquired in such a Course. Any of these apparent Interests seem better to account for the Crueltys of Tyrants, than the supposing in them a Principle of calm Malice without Interest, of which the rest of Mankind seem intirely incapable.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Temper of a Tyrant.} The Temper of a Tyrant seems a continu'd state of Anger, Hatred, and Fear. To form our Judgment then of his Motives of Action, and those of Men of like Tempers in lower Stations, let us reflect upon the Apprehensions we form of Mankind, when we are under any of those Passions which to the Tyrant are habitual. When we are under the fresh Impressions of an Injury, we find, that our Minds are wholly fill'd with Apprehensions of the Person who injur'd us, as if he were absolutely evil, and delighted in doing Mischief: We overlook the Virtues, which, when calm, we could have observ'd in him: we forget that perhaps he acted from Self-Love, and not Malice, or, it may be, some generous or kind Intention toward others. These, probably, are the Opinions which a Tyrant constantly forms concerning Mankind; and having very much weaken'd all kind Affections in himself, however he may pretend to them, he judges of the Tempers of others by his own. And were Men really such as he apprehends them, his Treatment of them would not be very unreasonable. We shall generally find our Passions arising suitably to the Apprehensions we form of others: if they are rashly form'd upon some sudden slight Views, it is no wonder if we find Dispositions following upon them, very little suited to the real State of human Nature.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Ordinary Springs of Vice.} The ordinary Springs of Vice then among Men, must be a mistaken Self-Love, made so violent, as to overcome Benevolence; or such strong Appetites, or Passions either selfish, or toward some narrow Systems, as overcome our Regard to Publick Good; or Affections arising from false, and rashly form'd Opinions of Mankind; which we run into thro' the weakness of our Benevolence. When Men, who had good Opinions of each other, happen to have contrary Interests, they are apt to have their good Opinions of each other abated, by imagining a design'd Opposition from Malice; without this, they can scarcely hate one another. Thus two Candidates for the same Office wish each other dead, because that is an ordinary way by which Men make room for each other; but if there remains any Reflection on each other's Virtue, as there sometimes may in benevolent Tempers, then their Opposition may be without Hatred; and if another better Post, where there is no Competition, were bestow'd on one of them, the other shall rejoice at it.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Self-Love indifferent.} Actions which flow solely from Self-Love, and yet evidence no Want of Benevolence, having no hurtful Effects upon others, seem of a middle Nature, neither virtuous nor vitious, and neither raise the Love or Hatred of the Observer. Our Reason can indeed discover certain Bounds, within which we may not only act from Self-Love, consistently with the Good of the Whole, but every Mortal's acting thus within these Bounds for his own Good, is absolutely necessary for the Good of the Whole; and the Want of such Self-Love would be universally pernicious. Hence, he who pursues his own private Good, with an Intention also to concur with that Constitution which tends to the Good of the Whole; and much more he who promotes his own Good, with a direct View of making himself more capable of serving God, or doing good to Mankind; acts not only innocently, but also honourably, and virtuously: for in both these Cases, Benevolence concurs with Self-Love to excite him to the Action. And thus a Neglect of our own Good may be morally evil, and argue a Want of Benevolence toward the Whole. But when Self-Love breaks over the Bounds above-mention'd, and leads us into Actions detrimental to others, and to the Whole; or makes us insensible of the generous kind Affections; then it appears vitious, and is disapprov'd. So also, when upon any small Injurys, or sudden Resentment, or any weak superstitious Suggestions, our Benevolence becomes so faint, as to let us entertain odious Conceptions of Men, or any Part of them, without just Ground, as if they were wholly evil, or malicious, or as if they were a worse Sort of Beings than they really are; these Conceptions must lead us into malevolent Affections, or at least weaken our good ones, and make us really vitious.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Benevolence of different Kinds.} Benevolence is a Word fit enough in general, to denote the internal Spring of Virtue, as Bishop Cumberland always uses it. But to understand this more distinctly, 'tis highly necessary to observe, that under this Name are included very different Dispositions of the Soul. Sometimes it denotes a calm, extensive Affection, or Good-will toward all Beings capable of Happiness or Misery: Sometimes, 2. A calm deliberate Affection of the Soul toward the Happiness of certain smaller Systems or Individuals; such as Patriotism, or Love of a Country, Friendship, Parental Affection, as it is in Persons of Wisdom and Self-Government: Or, 3. The several kind particular Passions of Love, Pity, Sympathy, Congratulation.

The first Sort is above all amiable and excellent: 'Tis perhaps the sole Moral Perfection of some superior Natures; and the more this prevails and rules in any human Mind, the more amiable the Person appears, even when it not only checks and limits our lower Appetites, but when it controuls our kind particular Passions, or counteracts them. The second Sort of Benevolence is more amiable than the third, when it is sufficiently strong to influence our Conduct: And the third Sort, tho' of a lesser Moral Dignity, is also beautiful, when it is no way opposite to these more noble Principles. And when it is opposite, tho' it does not justify such Actions as are really detrimental to greater Systems, yet it is a strong extenuating Circumstance, and much alleviates the Moral Deformity. We are all sensible of this, when any Person from Friendship, Parental-Affection, or Pity, has done something hurtful to larger Societies.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Self-Love not excluded by Benevolence.} Here we must also observe, that every moral Agent justly considers himself as a Part of this rational System, which may be useful to the Whole; so that he may be, in part, an Object of his own universal Benevolence. Nay further, as was hinted above, he may see, that the Preservation of the System requires every one to be innocently sollicitous about himself. Hence he may conclude, that an Action which brings greater Evil to the Agent, than Good to others, however it may evidence the Strength of some particular kind Attachment, or of a virtuous Disposition in the Agent, yet it must be founded upon a mistaken Opinion of its Tendency to publick Good: so that a Man who reason'd justly, and consider'd the whole, would not be led into it, by the calm extensive Benevolence, how strong soever it were; nor would he recommend it to the Practice of others; however he might acknowledge, that the Detriment arising to the Agent from a kind Action, did evidence a strong virtuous Disposition. Nay farther, if any Good was propos'd to the Pursuit of an Agent, and he had a Competitor in every respect only equal to himself; the highest universal Benevolence possible would not lead a wise Man to prefer another to himself, were there no Ties of Gratitude, or some other external Circumstance to move him to yield to his Competitor. A Man surely of the strongest Benevolence, may just treat himself as he would do a third Person, who was a Competitor of equal Merit with the other; and as his preferring one to another, in such a Case, would argue no Weakness of Benevolence; so no more would he evidence it by preferring himself to a Man of only equal Abilitys.","subId":"15","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Where-ever a Regard to myself tends as much to the good of the Whole, as Regard to another; or where the Evil to myself, is equal to the Good obtain'd for another; tho' by acting, in such Cases, for the Good of another, I really shew a very amiable Disposition; yet by acting in the contrary manner, from Regard to myself, I evidence no evil Disposition, nor any want of the most extensive Benevolence; since the Moment of Good to the Whole is, in both Cases, exactly equal. And let it be here observ'd, that this does not supersede the Necessity of Liberality, or gratuitous Gifts, altho' in such Actions the Giver loses what the other receives; since the Moment of Good to any Person, in any given Case, is in a compound Proportion of the Quantity of the Good it self, and the Indigence of the Person. Hence it appears, that a Gift may make a much greater Addition to the Happiness of the Receiver, than the Diminution it occasions in the Happiness of the Giver: And that the most useful and important Gifts are those from the Wealthy to the Indigent. Yet Gifts from Equals are not useless, since they often increase the Happiness of both, as they are strong Evidences of mutual Love: but Gifts from the Poor to the Wealthy are really foolish, unless they be only little Expressions of Gratitude, which are also fruitful of Joy on both Sides: for these Expressions of Gratitude are really delightful and acceptable to the Wealthy, if they have any Humanity; and their Acceptance of them is matter of Joy to the poor Giver.","subId":"16","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In like manner, when an Action does more Harm to the Agent, than Good to the Publick; the doing it evidences an amiable and truly virtuous Disposition in the Agent, tho 'tis plain he acts upon a mistaken View of his Duty.

Thus Benevolence toward the worst Characters, or the Study of their Good, may be as amiable as any whatsoever; yea, often more so than that toward the Good, since it argues such a strong Degree of Benevolence as can surmount the greatest Obstacle, the moral Evil in the Object. Hence the Love of unjust Enemys, is counted among the highest Virtues. Yet, when our Benevolence to the Evil encourages them in their bad Intentions, or makes them more capable of Mischief; this diminishes or destroys the Beauty of the Action, or even makes it evil, as it betrays a Neglect of the Good of others more valuable; Beneficence toward whom, would have tended more to the publick Good, than that toward our Favourites: But Benevolence toward evil Characters, which neither encourages nor enables them to do Mischief, nor diverts our Benevolence from Persons more useful, has as much moral Beauty as any whatsoever.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Qualitys determining our Election.} In comparing the moral Qualitys of Actions, in order to regulate our Election among various Actions propos'd, or to find which of them has the greatest moral Excellency, we are led by our moral Sense of Virtue to judge thus; that in equal Degrees of Happiness, expected to proceed from the Action, the Virtue is in proportion to the Number of Persons to whom the Happiness shall extend; (and here the Dignity or moral Importance of Persons, may compensate Numbers) and in equal Numbers, the Virtue is as the Quantity of the Happiness, or natural Good; or that the Virtue is in a compound Ratio of the Quantity of Good, and Number of Enjoyers. In the same manner, the moral Evil, or Vice, is as the Degree of Misery, and Number of Sufferers; so that That Action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers; and that worst, which, in like manner, occasions Misery.","subId":"19","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Consequences, how they affect the Morality of Actions.} Again, when the Consequences of Actions are of a mix'd Nature, partly advantageous, and partly pernicious; that Action is good, whose good Effects preponderate the evil by being useful to many, and pernicious to few; and that evil, which is otherwise. Here also the moral Importance of Characters, or Dignity of Persons may compensate Numbers; as may also the Degrees of Happiness or Misery: for to procure an inconsiderable Good to many, but an immense Evil to few, may be evil; and an immense Good to few, may preponderate a small Evil to many.","subId":"20","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But the Consequences which affect the Morality of Actions, are not only the direct and natural Effects of the Actions themselves; but also all those Events which otherwise would not have happen'd.

Thus if an Action of mine will probably, thro' the Mistakes or Corruption of others, be made a Precedent in unlike Cases, to very evil Actions; or when my Action, tho' good in itself, will probably provoke Men to very evil Actions, upon some mistaken Notion of their Right; any of these Considerations foreseen by me, may make such an Action of mine evil, whenever the Evils which will probably be occasion'd by the Action, are greater than the Evils occasion'd by the Omission.","subId":"21","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And this is the Reason, that many Laws prohibit Actions in general, even when some particular Instances of those Actions would be very useful; because an universal Allowance of them, considering the Mistakes Men would probably fall into, would be more pernicious than an universal Prohibition; nor could there be any more special Boundarys fix'd between the right and wrong Cases. In such Cases, it is the Duty of Persons to comply with the generally useful Constitution; or if in some very important Instances, the Violation of the Law would be of less evil Consequence, than Obedience to it, they must patiently resolve to undergo those Penalties, which the State has, for valuable Ends to the Whole, appointed: and this Disobedience will have nothing criminal in it.","subId":"22","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"'Tis here to be observed, that tho' every kind Affection abstractly considered, is approved by our moral Sense, yet all sorts of Affections or Passions which pursue the Good of others are not equally approved, or do not seem in the same degree virtuous.

Now every kind Passion, which is not pernicious to othres, is indeed approved as virtuous and lovely: And yet a calm Good-will toward the same Persons appears more lovely. So calm Good-will toward a small System is lovely and preferable to more passionate Attachments; and yet a more extensive calm Benevolence is still more beautiful and virtuous; and the highest Perfection of Virtue is an universal calm Good-will toward all sensitive Natures.

All Beneficence, even toward a Part, is amiable, when not inconsistent with the Good of the Whole: But this is a smaller Degree of Virtue, unless our Beneficence be restrain'd by want of Power, and not want of Love to the Whole. All strict Attachments to Partys, Sects, Factions, have but an imperfect Species of Beauty, even when the Good of the Whole requires a stricter Attachment to a Part, as in natural Affection, or virtuous Friendships; except when some Parts are so eminently useful to the Whole, that even universal Benevolence does determine us with special Care and Affection to study their Interests. Thus universal Benevolence would incline us to a more strong Concern for the Interests of great and generous Characters in a high Station, or make us more earnestly study the Interests of any generous Society, whose whole Constitution was contriv'd to promote universal Good. Thus a good Fancy in Architecture would lead a Man, who was not able to bear the Expence of a completely regular Building, to chuse such a Degree of Ornament as he could keep uniformly thro' the Whole, and not move him to make a vain unfinish'd Attempt in one Part, of what he foresaw he could not succeed in as to the Whole. And he wouldcondemn a great Profusion of Ornament on one Part, above the Proportion of the Whole, unless that Part be some eminent Place of the Edifice, such as the chief Front, or publick Entrance; the adorning of which would beautify the Whole more than an equal Expence of Ornament on any other Part.","subId":"24","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Constitution of our Sense, whereby the moral Beauty of Actions, or Dispositions, increases according to the Number of Persons to whom the good Effects of them extend; whence also Actions which flow from the nearer Attachments of Nature, such as that between the Sexes, and the Love of our Offspring, do not appear so virtuous as Actions of equal Moment of Good towards Persons less attach'd to us; has been chosen by the Author of Nature for this good Reason, \"That the more limited Instincts tend to produce a smaller Moment of Good, because confined to small Numbers.

Those calmer Determinations of the Will, whether of greater of less Extent, or sedate strong Affections, or Desires of the Good of others, are more amiable. These may be as much rooted in the Frame of the Soul, or there may be as natural a Disposition to them as to particular Passions. They tell us, That \"Virtue should wholly spring from Reason;\" as if Reason or Knowledge of any true Proposition could ever move to action where there is no End proposed, and no Affection or Desire toward that End.

Now may not another Instinct toward the Publick, or the Good of others, be as proper a Principle of Virtue, as the Instinct toward private Happiness? This is certain, that whereas we behold the selfish Actions of others, with Indifference at best, we see something amiable in every Action which flows from kind Affections or Passions toward others; if they be conducted by Prudence, so as any way to attain their End, consistently with the general Good. If it be said, \"That Actions from Instinct are not the Effect of Prudence and Choice;\" this Objection holds full as strongly against the Actions which flow from Self-Love; since the Use of our Reason is as requisite to find the proper Means of promoting publick Good, as private Good. And as it must be an Instinct, or a Determination previous to Reason, which makes us pursue private Good, as well as publick Good as our End; there is the same occasion for Prudence and Choice, in the Election of proper Means for promoting of either. I see no harm in supposing, \"That Men are naturally dispos'd to Virtue, and not left merely indifferent, until some Prospect of Interest allures them to it.\" Surely, the Supposition of a benevolent universal Instinct, would recommend human Nature, and its Author, more to the Love of a good Man, and leave Room enough for the Exercise of our Reason, in contriving and settling Rights, Laws, Constitutions; in inventing Arts, and practising them so as to gratify, in the most effectual manner, that generous Inclination. And if we must bring in Self-Love to make Virtue rational, a little Reflection will discover, as shall appear hereafter, that this Benevolence is our greatest Happiness; and thence we may resolve to cultivate, as much as possible, this sweet Disposition, and to despise every opposite Interest. Not that we can be truly Virtuous, if we intend only to obtain the Pleasure which arises from Beneficence, without the Love of others: Nay, this very Pleasure is founded on our being conscious of disinterested Love to others, as the Spring of our Actions. But Self-Interest may be our Motive in studying to raise these kind Affections, and to continue in this agreeable State; tho' it cannot be the sole or principal Motive of any Action, which to our moral Sense appears virtuous.","subId":"45","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IGE.3.45"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Heroism in all stations.} From the preceding Reasonings we shall only draw this one Inference, which seems the most joyful imaginable, even to the lowest Rank of Mankind, viz. \"That no external Circumstances of Fortune, no involuntary Disadvantages, can exclude any Mortal from the most heroick Virtue.\" For how small soever the Moment of publick Good be, which any one can accomplish, yet if his Abilitys are proportionably small, the Virtue may be as great as any whatsoever.
