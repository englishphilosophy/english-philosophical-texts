Other Minds may be so fram'd as to receive no Pleasure from Uniformity; and we actually find, that the same regular Forms seem not equally to please all the Animals known to us, as shall probably appear hereafter. Therefore let us make what is the most unfavourable Supposition to the present Argument, viz. That the Constitution of our Sense so as to approve Uniformity, is merely arbitrary in the Author of our Nature; and that there are an infinity of Tastes or Relishes of Beauty possible; so that it would be impossible to throw together fifty or a hundred Pebbles, which should not make an agreeable Habitation for some Animal or other, and appear beautiful to it. And then it is plain, that from the Perception of Beauty in any one Effect, we should have no reason to conclude Design in the Cause: for a Sense might be so constituted as to be pleas'd with such Irregularity as may be the effect of an undirected Force. But then, as there are an Infinity of Forms possible into which any System may be reduc'd, an Infinity of Places in which Animals may be situated, and an Infinity of Relishes or Senses in these Animals is suppos'd possible; that in the immense Spaces any one Animal should by Chance be plac'd in a System agreeable to its Taste, must be improbable as infinite to one at least: And much more unreasonable is it to expect from Chance, that a multitude of Animals agreeing in their Sense of Beauty should obtain agreeable Places.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Undirected Force.} There is also the same Probability, that in any one System of Matter an Undirected Force will produce a regular Form, as any one given irregular one, of the same degree of Complication: But still the irregular Forms into which any System may be rang'd, surpass in multitude the Regular, as Infinite does Unity; for what holds in one small System, will hold in a Thousand, a Million, a Universe, with more Advantage, viz. that the irregular Forms possible infinitely surpass the Regular. For Instance, the Area of an Inch Square is capable of an Infinity of regular Forms, the Equilateral Triangle, the Square, the Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, &c. but for each one regular Form, there are an Infinity of irregular, as an Infinity of Scalena for the one equilateral Triangle, an Infinity of Trapezia for the one Square, of irregular Pentagons for the one Regular, and so on: and therefore supposing any one System agitated by undesigning Force, it is infinitely more probable that it will resolve itself into an irregular Form, than a regular. Thus, that a System of six Parts upon Agitation shall not obtain the Form of a regular Hexagon, is at least infinite to Unity; and the more complex we make the System, the greater is the hazard, from a very obvious Reason.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"We see this confirm'd by our constant Experience, that Regularity never arises from any undesign'd Force of ours; and from this we conclude, that where-ever there is any Regularity in the Disposition of a System capable of many other Dispositions, there must have been Design in the Cause; and the Force of this Evidence increases, according to the Multiplicity of Parts imploy'd.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But this Conclusion is too rash, unless some further Proof be introduc'd; and what leads us into it is this. Men, who have a Sense of Beauty in Regularity, are led generally in all their Arrangements of Bodys to study some kind of Regularity, and seldom ever design Irregularity: hence we judge the same of other Beings too, viz. that they study Regularity; and presume upon Intention in the Cause where-ever we see it, making Irregularity always a Presumption of Want of Design: whereas if other Agents have different Senses of Beauty, or if they have no Sense of it at all, Irregularity may as well be design'd as Regularity. And then let it be observ'd, that in this Case there is just the same Reason to conclude Design in the Cause from any one irregular Effect, as from a regular one: for since there are an Infinity of other Forms possible as well as this irregular one produc'd; and since to such a Being void of a Sense of Beauty, all Forms are as to its own Relish indifferent, and all agitated Matter meeting must make some Form or other, and all Forms, upon Supposition that the Force is apply'd by an Agent void of a Sense of Beauty, would equally prove Design; it is plain that no one Form proves it more than another, or can prove it at all; except from a general metaphysical Consideration, that there is no proper Agent without Design and Intention, and that every Effect flows from the Intention of some Cause.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Similar Forms by Chance, impossible.} This however follows from the above mention'd Considerations, that supposing a Mass of Matter surpassing a cubick Inch, as infinite of the first Power does Unity, and that this whole Mass were some way determin'd from its own Nature without any Design in a Cause (which perhaps is scarce possible) to resolve itself into the solid Content of a cubick Inch, and into a prismatick Form whose Base should always be ½ of a square Inch; suppose these Conditions determin'd, and all others left to undirected Force; all which we could expect from undirected Force in this Case would be one equilateral Prism, or two perhaps; because there are an Infinity of irregular Prisms possible of the same Base, and solid Content: and when we met with many such Prisms, we must probably conclude them produc'd by Design, since they are more than could have been expected by the Laws of Hazard.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But if this infinite Mass was no way determin'd to a prismatick Form, we could only expect from its casual Concourse one Prism of any Kind, since there is an Infinity of other Solids into which the Mass might be resolv'd; and if we found any great number of Prisms, we should have reason to presume Design: so that in a Mass of Matter as infinite of the first Power, we could not from any Concourse or Agitation expect with any good ground a Body of any given Dimensions or Size, and of any given Form; since of any Dimension there are infinite Forms possible, and of any Form there are an Infinity of Dimensions; and if we found several Bodys of the same Dimension and Form, we should have so much Presumption for Design.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is one trifling Objection which may perhaps arise from the crystallizing of certain Bodys, when the Fluid is evaporated in which they were swimming: for in this we frequently see regular Forms arising, tho' there is nothing suppos'd in this Affair but an undirected Force of Attraction. But to remove this Objection, we need only consider, that we have good Reason to believe, that the smallest Particles of Crystalliz'd Bodys have fix'd regular Forms given them in the Constitution of Nature; and then it is easy to conceive how their Attractions may produce regular Forms: but unless we suppose some preceding Regularity in the Figures of attracting Bodys, they can never form any regular Body at all. And hence we see how improbable it is, that the whole Mass of Matter, not only in this Globe, but in all the fixed Stars known to us by our Eyes or Glasses, were they a thousand times larger than our Astronomers suppose, could in any Concourse have produc'd any Number of similar Bodys Regular or Irregular.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Combinations by Chance, impossible.} And let it be here observ'd, that there are many Compositions of Bodys which the smallest Degree of Design could easily effect, which yet we would in vain expect from all the Powers of Chance or undesigned Force, after an Infinity of Rencounters; even supposing a Dissolution of every Form except the regular one, that the Parts might be prepar'd for a new Agitation. Thus supposing we could expect one equilateral Prism of any given Dimensions should be form'd from undirected Force, in an Infinity of Matter some way determin'd to resolve itself into Bodys of a given solid Content, (which is all we could expect, since it is infinite to one after the solid Content is obtain'd, that the Body shall not be Prismatical; and allowing it Prismatical, it is infinite to one that it shall not be Equilateral:) And again, supposing another Infinity of Matter determin'd to resolve itself into Tubes, of Orifices exactly equal to the Bases of the former Prisms, it is again at least as the second Power of Infinite to Unity, that not one of these Tubes shall be both Prismatick and Equiangular; and then if the Tube were thus form'd, so as to be exactly capable of receiving one of the Prisms, and no more, it is infinite to one that they shall never meet in infinite Space; and should they meet, it is infinite to one that the Axes of the Prism and Tube shall never happen in the same strait Line; and supposing they did, it is again as infinite to three, that Angle shall not meet Angle, so as to enter. We see then how infinitely improbable it is, \"that all the Powers of Chance in infinite Matter, agitated thro' infinite Ages, could ever effect this small Composition of a Prism entering a Prismatick Bore; and, that all our hazard for it would at most be but as Three is to the third Power of Infinite.\" And yet the smallest Design could easily effect it.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"May we not then justly count it altogether absurd, and next to an absolute strict Impossibility, \"That all the Powers of undirected Force should ever effect such a complex Machine as the most imperfect Plant, or the meanest Animal, even in one Instance?\" For the Improbability just increases, as the Complication of Mechanism in these natural Bodys surpasses that simple Combination above-mention'd.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Let it be here observ'd, \"That the preceding Reasoning from the Frequency of regular Bodys of one Form in the Universe, and from the Combinations of various Bodys, is intirely independent on any Perception of Beauty; and would equally prove Design in the Cause, altho' there were no Being which perceiv'd Beauty in any Form whatsoever:\" for it is in short this, \"That the recurring of any Effect oftner than the Laws of Hazard determine, gives Presumption of Design; and, That Combinations which no undesign'd Force could give us Reason to expect, must necessarily prove the same; and that with superior Probability, as the Multitude of Cases in which the contrary might happen, surpass all the Cases in which this could happen:\" which appears to be in the simplest Cases at least as Infinite does to Unity. And the frequency of similar irregular Forms, or exact Combinations of them, is an equal Argument of Design in the Cause, since the Similarity, or exact Combinations of irregular Forms, are as little to be expected from all the Powers of undirected Force, as any sort whatsoever.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To bring this nearer to something like a Theorem, altho' the Idea of Infinite be troublesome enough to manage in Reasoning: The Powers of Chance, with infinite Matter in infinite Ages, may answer Hazards as the fifth Power of Infinite, and no more: thus the Quantity of Matter may be conceiv'd as the third Power of Infinite, and no more, the various Degrees of Force may make another Power of Infinite, and the Number of Rencounters may make the fifth. But this last only holds on Supposition, that after every Rencounter there is no Cohesion, but all is dissolv'd again for a new Concourse, except in similar Forms or exact Combinations; which Supposition is intirely groundless, since we see dissimilar Bodys cohering as strongly as any, and rude Masses more than any Combinations. Now to produce any given Body, in a given Place or Situation, and of given Dimensions, or Shape, the Hazards of the contrary are, one Power of Infinite at least to obtain the Place or Situation; when the Situation is obtain'd, the Solid Content requires another Power of Infinite to obtain it; the Situation and Solidity obtain'd require, for accomplishing the simplest given Shape, at least the other three Powers of Infinite. For instance, let the Shape be a four-sided Prism or Parallelopiped; that the Surfaces should be Planes requires one Power; that they should be Parallel in this Case, or inclin'd in any given Angle in any other Case, requires another Power of Infinite; and that they should be in any given Ratio to each other, requires at least the third Power: for in each of these Heads there is still an Infinity at least of other Cases possible beside the one given. So that all the Powers of Chance could only produce perhaps one Body of every simpler Shape or Size at most, and this is all we could expect: we might expect one Pyramid, or Cube, or Prism perhaps; but when we increase the Conditions requir'd, the Prospect must grow more improbable, as in more complex Figures, and in all Combinations of Bodys, and in similar Species, which we never could reasonably hope from Chance; and therefore where we see them, we must certainly ascribe them to Design.","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Combinations of irregular Forms, equally impossible.} The Combinations of regular Forms, or of irregular ones exactly adapted to each other, require such vast Powers of Infinite to effect them, and the Hazards of the contrary Forms are so infinitely numerous, that all Probability or Possibility of their being accomplish'd by Chance seems quite to vanish. Let us apply the Cases in [Art. vi. of this Section] about the Prism and Tube, to our simplest Machines, such as a pair of Wheels of our ordinary Carriages; each Circular, Spokes equal in length, thickness, shape; the Wheels set Parallel, the Axle-tree fix'd in the Nave of both, and secur'd from coming out at either End: Now the Cases in which the contrary might have happen'd from undirected Concourses, were there no more requir'd than what is just now mention'd, must amount in Multitude to a Power of Infinite equal to every Circumstance requir'd. What shall we say then of a Plant, a Tree, an Animal, a Man, with such multitudes of adapted Vessels, such Articulations, Insertions of Muscles, Diffusion of Veins, Arterys, Nerves? The Improbability that such Machines should be the Effect of Chance, must be near the infinitesimal Power of Infinite to Unity.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Further, were all the former Reasoning from Similarity of Forms and Combinations groundless, and could Chance give us ground to expect such Forms, with exact Combination, yet we could only promise ourselves one of these Forms among an Infinity of others.

None but the barest Possibility against an inconceivably great Probability, surpassing every thing which is not strict Demonstration.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Argument, as has been already observ'd, is quite abstracted from any Sense of Beauty in any particular Form; for the exact Similarity of a hundred or a thousand Trapezia, proves Design as well as the Similarity of Squares, since both are equally above all the Powers of undirected Force or Chance; and what is above the Powers of Chance, must give us proportionable Presumption for Design.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus, allowing that a Leg, or Arm, or Eye, might have been the Effect of Chance, (which was shewn to be most absurd, and next to absolutely impossible) that it should not have a corresponding Leg, Arm, Eye, exactly similar, must be a hazard of a Power of Infinite proportion'd to the Complication of Parts; for in Proportion to this is the multitude of Cases increas'd, in which it would not have a corresponding Member similar: so that allowing twenty or thirty Parts in such a Structure, it would be as the twentieth or thirtieth Power of Infinite to Unity, that the corresponding Part should not be similar.

Suppose a Trapezium of a foot Square in Area should appear grosly similar to another, while no one Side differs, by 1/10 of an Inch; or no Angle in one surpasses the corresponding one in the other above ten Minutes: now this tenth of an Inch is infinitely divisible, as are also the ten Minutes, so that the Cases of insensible Dissimilarity under apparent Similarity are really Infinite. But then it is also plain that there are an Infinity of different sensibly dissimilar Trapezia, even of the same Area, according as we vary a Side by one Tenth, two Tenths, three Tenths, and so on, and vary the Angles and another Side so as to keep the Area equal. Now in each of these infinite Degrees of sensible Dissimilitude the several Tenths are infinitely divisible as well as in the first Case; so that the multitude of sensible Dissimilaritys are to the multitude of insensible Dissimilaritys under apparent Resemblance, still as the second Power of Infinite to the first, or as Infinite to Unity. And then how vastly greater must the Multitude be, of all possible sensible Dissimilaritys in such complex Bodys as Legs, Arms, Eyes, Arterys, Veins, Skeletons?","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the Dissimilaritys of Animals of the same Species, it is in the same manner plain, that the possible Cases of gross Dissimilarity are Infinite; and then every Case of gross Dissimilarity contains also all the Cases of insensible Dissimilarity. Thus, if we would count all Animals of a Species grosly similar, while there was no Limb which in Length or Diameter did exceed the ordinary Shape by above a third of the Head; it is plain that there are an Infinity of sensibly different gross Dissimilaritys possible, and then in each of these Cases of gross Dissimilarity, there are an Infinity of Cases of nicer Dissimilarity, since 1/3 of the Head may be infinitely divided. To take a low but easy Instance; two Cockle-Shells which fitted each other naturally, may have an Infinity of insensible Differences, but still there are an Infinity of possible sensible Differences; and then in any one of the sensibly different Forms, there may be the same Infinity of insensible Differences beside the sensible one: So that still the hazard for even gross Similarity from Chance is Infinite to one, and this always increases by a Power of Infinite for every distinct Member of the Animal, in which even gross Similarity is retain'd; since the Addition of every Member or Part to a complex Machine, makes a new Infinity of Cases, in which sensible Dissimilarity may happen; and this Infinity combin'd with the infinite Cases of the former Parts, raises the Hazard by a Power of Infinite.","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now this may sufficiently shew us the Absurdity of the Cartesian or Epicurean Hypothesis, even granting their Postulatum of undirected Force impress'd on infinite Matter; and seems almost a Demonstration of Design in the Universe.","subId":"19","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One Objection more remains to be remov'd, viz. \"That some imagine, this Argument may hold better àPriori than àPosteriori; that is, we have better Reason to believe, when we see a Cause about to act, without Knowledge, that he will not attain any given, or desir'd End; than we have on the other hand to believe, when we see the End actually attain'd, that he acted with Knowledge: Thus, say they, when a particular Person is about to draw a Ticket in a Lottery, where there is but one Prize to a thousand Blanks, it is highly probable that he shall draw a Blank; but suppose we have seen him actually draw for himself the Prize, we have no ground to conclude that he had Knowledge or Art to accomplish this End.\" But the Answer is obvious: In such Contrivances we generally have, from the very Circumstances of the Lottery, very strong moral Arguments, which almost demonstrate that Art can have no place; so that a Probability of a thousand to one, does not surmount those Arguments: But let the Probability be increas'd, and it will soon surmount all Arguments to the contrary. For instance, If we saw a Man ten times successively draw Prizes, in a Lottery where there were but ten Prizes to ten thousand Blanks, I fancy few would question whether he us'd Art or not: much less would we imagine it were Chance, if we saw a Man draw for his own Gain successively a hundred, or a thousand Prizes, from among a proportionably greater number of Blanks. Now in the Works of Nature the Case is entirely different: we have not the least Argument against Art or Design. An Intelligent Cause is surely at least as probable a Notion as Chance, general Force, Conatus ad Motum, or the Clinamen Principiorum, to account for any Effect whatsoever: And then all the Regularity, Combinations, Similaritys of Species, are so many Demonstrations, that there was Design and Intelligence in the Cause of this Universe: Whereas in fair Lotterys, all Art in drawing is made, if not actually impossible, at least highly improbable.","subId":"20","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Irregularity does not prove want of Design.} Let it be here observ'd also, \"That a rational Agent may be capable of impressing Force without intending to produce any particular Form, and of designedly producing irregular or dissimilar Forms, as well as regular and similar:\" And hence it follows, \"That altho' all the Regularity, Combination and Similarity in the Universe, are Presumptions of Design, yet Irregularity is no Presumption of the contrary; unless we suppose that the Agent is determin'd from a Sense of Beauty always to act regularly, and delight in Similarity; and that he can have no other inconsistent Motive of Action:\" Which last is plainly absurd. We do not want in the Universe many Effects which seem to have been left to the general Laws of Motion upon some great Impulse, and have many Instances where Similarity has been plainly design'd in some respects, and probably neglected in others; or even Dissimilarity design'd. Thus we see the general exact Resemblance between the two Eyes of most persons; and yet perhaps no other third Eye in the World is exactly like them. We see a gross Conformity of shape in all Persons in innumerable Parts, and yet no two Individuals of any Species are undistinguishable; which perhaps is intended for valuable Purposes to the whole Species.","subId":"21","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.21"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Wisdom, Prudence.} Hitherto the Proof amounts only to Design or Intention barely, in opposition to blind Force or Chance; and we see the Proof of this is independent on the arbitrary Constitution of our internal Sense of Beauty.

And therefore the Beauty apparent to us in Nature, will not of itself prove Wisdom in the Cause, unless this Cause, or Author of Nature be suppos'd Benevolent; and then indeed the Happiness of Mankind is desirable or Good to the Supreme Cause; and that Form which pleases us, is an Argument of his Wisdom. And the Strength of this Argument is increased always in proportion to the Degree of Beauty produc'd in Nature, and expos'd to the View of any rational Agents; since upon supposition of a Benevolent Deity, all the apparent Beauty produc'd is an Evidence of the Execution of a Benevolent Design, to give them the Pleasures of Beauty.","subId":"23","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But what more immediately proves Wisdom is this; when we see any Machine with a great Complication of Parts actually obtaining an End, we justly conclude, \"That since this could not have been the Effect of Chance, it must have been intended for that End, which is obtain'd by it;\" and then the Ends or Intentions being in part known, the Complication of Organs, and their nice Disposition adapted to this End, is an Evidence \"of a comprehensive large Understanding in the Cause, according to the Multiplicity of Parts, and the Appositeness of their Structure, even when we do not know the Intention of the Whole.\"","subId":"24","id":"Hutcheson.IBV.IBO.5.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{General Causes.} There is another kind of Beauty from which we conclude Wisdom in the Cause, as well as Design, when we see many useful or beautiful Effects flowing from one general Cause.

Nor is this speculative Reason all which influences them; for even beside this Consideration of Interest, they are determin'd by a Sense of Beauty, where that Reason does not hold; as when we are judging of the Productions of other Agents about whose Oeconomy we are not sollicitous. Thus, who does not approve of it as a Perfection in Clock-work, that three or four Motions of the Hour, Minute, and second Hands, and monthly Plate, should arise from one Spring or Weight, rather than from three or four Springs or Weights, in a very Compound Machine, which should perform the same Effects, and answer all the same Purposes with equal Exactness?

The uniform Principle of Gravity preserves at once the Planets in their Orbits, gives Cohesion to the Parts of each Globe, and Stability to Mountains, Hills, and artificial Structures; it raises the Sea in Tides, and sinks them again, and restrains them in their Channels; it drains the Earth of its superfluous Moisture, by Rivers; it raises the Vapours by its Influence on the Air, and brings them down again in Rains; it gives an uniform Pressure to our Atmosphere, necessary to our Bodys in general, and more especially to Inspiration in Breathing; and furnishes us with an universal Movement, capable of being apply'd in innumerable Engines.
