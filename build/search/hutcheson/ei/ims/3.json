In Signification of Words these things are included: 1. An Association of an Idea with a Sound, so that when any Idea is formed by the Speaker, the Idea of a Soundaccompanies it. 2. The Sound perceivedby the Hearer excites the Idea to which it is connected. 3. In like manner a Judgment in the Speaker's Mind is accompanyed with the Idea of a Combination of Sounds. 4. This Combination of Sounds heard raises the Apprehension of that Judgment in the Mind of the Hearer. Nothing farther than these Circumstances seems to be denoted by Signification.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Conclusions drawn from Speech.}Hearing a Proposition does not of itself produce either Assent or Dissent, or Opinion in the Hearer, but only presents to his Apprehension the Judgment, or Thema Complexum. But the Hearer himself often forms Judgments or Opinions upon this occasion, either immediately without Reasoning, or by some short Argument. These Opinions are some one or more of the following Propositions. 1. That a Sound is perceived, and a Judgment apprehended. 2. Such a Person caused the Sound heard. 3. The Speaker intended to excite in the Hearer the Idea of the Sound, and the Apprehension of the Judgment, or Thema Complexum. This Judgment is not always formed by the Hearer, nor is it always true, when Men are heard speaking. 4. The Speaker intended to produce Assent in the Hearer: This Judgment is not always true. 5. The Speaker assents to the Proposition spoken: This Judgment in the Hearer is often false, and is formed upon Opinion of the Speaker's Veracity, or speaking what expresses his Opinion usually. 6. The Speaker does not assent to the Proposition spoken: This Judgment of the Hearer is often false, when what is spoken is every way true. 7. The Speaker intended that the Hearer should believe or judge, \"that the Proposition spoken was assented to by the Speaker.\" 8. The Speaker had the contrary Intention, to that supposed in the last Judgment: Both these latter Judgments may be false, when the Proposition spoken is every way true. 9. The Proposition spoken represents the Object as it is, or is logically true. 10. The Proposition spoken does not represent the Object as it is, or it is logically false.","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Morality does not consist in Significancy.}As to the first four Circumstances which make up the proper Significancy of Speech, 'tis scarce possible that any one should place moral Goodor Evil in them. Whether the Proposition were logically true or false, the having a bare Apprehension of it as a Thema Complexum, or raising this in another, without intending to produce Assent or Dissent, can have no more moral Goodor Evil in it, than the Reception of any other Idea, or raising it in another. This Significancy of Falshoodis found in the very Propositions given in Schools, as Instances of Falshood, Absurdity, Contradiction to Truth, or Blasphemy. The pronouncing of which, are Actions signifying more properly than most of our other Actions; and yet no body condemns them as immoral.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Nor in Conclusions formed by Hearers.}[256] As to the Opinions formed by the Hearer, they are all his own Action as much as any other Conclusion or Judgment formed from Appearances of any sort whatsoever. They are true or false, according to the Sagacity of the Observer, or his Caution. The Hearer may form perfectly true Opinions or Judgments, when the Speaker is guilty of the basest Fraud; and may form false Judgments, when the Speaker is perfectly innocent, and spoke nothing false in any Sense.","subId":"5","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Evils which may follow from the false Judgments of the Hearer, are no otherwise chargeable on the Speaker, than as the evil Consequences of another's Action of any kind may be chargeable upon any Person who co‐operated; or, by his Action, or Omission, the Consequence of which he might have foreseen, did either actually intendthis Evil, or wanted that Degree of kind Affection, which would have inclined him to have prevented it.","subId":"6","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{The Morality of Speech in the Intention.}The Intention of the Speaker is what all Moralists have hitherto imagined the Virtue or Vice of Words did depend upon, and not the bare Significancy of Truth or Falshood. This Intention is either, 1. To lead the Hearer into a true or false Opinion about the Sentiments of the Speaker. 2. To make the Hearer assent to the Proposition spoken. Or, 3. Both to make the Hearer assent to the Proposition, and judge that the Speaker also assents to it. Or, 4. To accomplish some End, by means of the Hearer's assent to the Proposition spoken. This End may be known by the Speaker to be either publickly useful, or publickly hurtful.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Some Moralists of late have placed all Virtue in Speech in the Intention of the last kind, viz. \"Accomplishing some publickly useful End, by speaking either logical Truth or Falshood: and that all Vice in speaking, consists in intending to effect something publickly hurtful by Speech, whether logically true or false, and known to be such; or by using Speech in a manner which we may foresee would be publickly hurtful, whether we actually intendthis evil Consequence or not.\" Some stricter Moralists assert, that \"the publick Evils which would ensue from destroying mutual Confidence, by allowing to speak Propositions known to be false on any occasion, are so great, that no particular Advantage to be expected from speaking known logical Falshoods, can ever over‐ballance them; that all use of Speech supposes a tacit Convention of Sincerity, the Violation of which is always evil.\" Both sides in this Argument agree, that the moral Evil in Speech consists either in some direct malicious Intention, or a Tendency to the publick Detriment of Society; which Tendency the Agent might have foreseen, as connected with his Action, had he not wantedthat Degree of good Affections which makes Men attentive to the Effects of their Actions. Never was bare Significancy of Falshoodmade the Idea of moral Evil. Speaking logical Falshoodwas still looked upon as innocent in many cases. Speaking contrary to Sentiment, or moral Falshood, was always proved evil, from some publickly hurtful Tendency, and not supposed as evil immediately, or the same Idea with Vice. The Intention to deceive was the Foundation of the Guilt. This Intention the Speaker studies to conceal, and does not signify it: It is an Act of the Will, neither signifiedby his Words, nor itself signifying any thing else.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"This Point deserved Consideration, because if any Action be significant, 'tis certainly the Act of Speaking: And yet even in this the Virtue is not the signifying of Truth, nor the Vice the signifying Falshood.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{The Significancy of Actions.}The Signification of some Actions depends upon a like Association of Ideas with them, made either by Nature, or arbitrarily, and by Custom, as with Sounds. Letters are by Custom the Signs of Sounds. A Shriek or Groan is a natural Sign of Fear or Pain: A Motion of the Handor Headmay signify Assent, Dissent, or Desire. The cutting down tall Poppies was an answer: The sending Spurs, advice to Flight: Kindling many Fires raises the Opinion of an Encampment: Raising a Smoke will raise Opinion of Fire.","subId":"10","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The most important Distinction of Signs is this, that 1. \"Some Appearances are the Occasion upon which an Observer, by his own reasoning, forms a Judgment, without supposing, or having reason to believe, that the Agent, who caused these Appearances, did it with design to communicate his Sentiments to others; or when the Actions are such as are usually done by the Agents, without designing to raise Opinions in Observers. 2. Some Actions are never used but with professed Design to convey the Opinions of the Agent to the Observer; or such as the Observer infers nothing from, but upon having reason to believe that the Causer of the Appearance intended to convey some Sentiment to the Observer.\" 3. Other Signs are used, when \"the Signifier gives no reason to conclude any other Intention, but only to raise an Apprehension of the Judgment, or the Thema Complexum, without professing any design to communicate his Sentiments, or to produce any Assent in the Observer.\"","subId":"11","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.11"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To do Actions from which the Observer will form false Opinions, without having reason to imagine an Intention in the Agent, is never of itself imagined evil, let the Signs be natural or instituted; provided there be no malicious Intention, or neglect of publick Good. 'Tis never called a Crime in a Teacher, to pronounce an absurd Sentence for an instance; in a Nobleman, to travel without Coronets; or a Clergyman in Lay‐Habit, for private Conveniency, or to avoid troublesome Ceremony; to leave Lights in a Lodge, to make People conclude there is a Watch kept. This Significancy may be in any Action which is observed; but as true Conclusions argue no Virtue in the Agent, so false ones argue no Vice.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Raising false Opinions designedly by the second Sort of Signs, which reasonably lead the Observer to conclude Intention in the Agent to communicate his Sentiments, whether the Signs be customary, instituted, or natural, is generally evil, when the Agent knows the Falshood; since it tends to diminish mutual Confidence. To send Spurs to a Friend, whom the Sender imagines to be in no danger, to deceive by Hieroglyphicks or Painting, is as criminal as a false Letter. This Significancy occurs in very few human Actions: Some of the most important Virtues profess no design of communicating Sentiments, or raising Opinions either true or false: Nor is there any more Intention in some of the most vicious Actions. Again, who can imagine any Virtue, in all Actions, where there is this Significancy of Truth with Intention? Is it Virtue to say at Christmas, that \"the Mornings are sharp?\" to beckon with the Hand, in sign of Assent to such an Assertion? And in false Propositions thus signified by Actions or Words, there is no Evil apprehended where the Falshoodis only logical. When the Falshood is known by the Agent, the Evil is not imagined in the Significancy, but in doing what one may foresee tends to breed Distrust in Society. And did all moral Evil consist in moral Falshood, there could be no Sins of Ignorance. If Mr. Woolaston alledges, that \"Ignorance of some things signifies this Falshood, viz. We are not obliged to know the Truth:\" This Falshood is not signified with Intention; nor is it moral Falshood, but only logical: since no Man in an Error knows that \"he is obliged to know the contrary Truth,\" Mr. Woolaston's use of the Words [ought] or [obliged] without a distinct Meaning, is not peculiar to this Place.","subId":"13","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The third sort of Significancy of Falsehoodis never apprehended as morally Evil: if it were, then every Dramatick Writer drawing evil Characters, every History Painter, every Writer of Allegories, or Epicks, every Philosopher teaching the Nature of contradictory Propositions, would be thought criminal.","subId":"14","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Significancy different from the Morality.}But since only the first sort of Significancy can be in all Actions, and that too supposing that every Action whatsoever is observedby some Being or other: Let us see if this will account for Morality.

An exact Reasoner would receive no false Opinion from the worst Action concerning the Object or Relation of the Agent to it: And a false Opinion might be formed by a weak Observer of a perfectly good Action.—An Observer who knew an Agent to have the basest Temper, would not from his worst Action conclude any thing false concerning the Object: And all such false Opinions would arise only upon Supposition that the Agent was virtuous.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But may it not be said, that \"whether Men reason well about Actions or not, there are some Conclusions really deducible from every Action? It is a Datum from which something may be inferred by just Consequence, whether any one actually infers it or not. Then may not this Quality in Actions, whether we call it Significancy or not, that only true Propositions can be inferred from them by just Reasoning, be moral Goodness? And may it not be the very Idea of moral Evil in Actions, that some false Conclusions can by just Consequence, be deduced from them? \" Or if we will not allow these to be the very Ideas of moral Good and Evil, \"are they not universal just Characters to distinguish the one from the other?\"","subId":"18","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.18"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"One may here observe in general, that since the Existence of the Action is supposed to be a true Premise or Datum, no false Conclusion can possibly be inferred from it by just Reasoning.

Thus suppose the \"Constitution of Nature such, that the private Interest of each Individual is connected with the publick Good:\" Suppose an Agent's Affections selfish only, then from a publickly useful Action we infer, that \"the Agent's Opinions are true:\" And from a publickly hurtful Action conclude his Opinions to be false.","subId":"20","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The same Constitution supposed with publick Affections as well as selfish.

This is not proper Signification. A judicious Observer never imagines any Intention to communicate Opinions in some of the most important Actions, either goodor evil. 2. Did an Action signify Falshood, 'tis generally only logical. 3. The false Opinion in the Agent is not the Quality for which the evil Action is condemned; nor is the true Opinion that for which the good Action is approved.

If what is meant be altering the Laws of Nature, or desiring that they were stopped; this is seldom desired by any but Madmen, nor is this Desire evidenced by some of the worst Actions, nor is such Desire always criminal; otherwise it were as great a Crime as any, to wish, when a Dam was broken down, that the Water would not overflow the Country.","subId":"39","id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS.3.39"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"If making Things be what they are not, means \"attempting or desiring that any Subject should have two opposite Qualities at once, or a Quality and its Privation;\" 'tis certain then, that according to the Stoicks, all vicious Men are thorowly mad.
