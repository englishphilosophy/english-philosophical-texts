The second (1730) was merely a reprint of the first, but the third (1742) contained some significant revisions. Consequently the third is our copytext. The text was derived from Aaron Garrett's edition (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2002), which follows the first edition (noting significant differences between this and third). This source text has been substantially altered, to bring the text in line with the 1742 edition.","sourceUrl":"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hutcheson-an-essay-on-the-nature-and-conduct-of-the-passions-and-affections-1742-2002/simple","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"AN\nESSAY\nON THE\nNature and Conduct\nOF THE\nPassions and Affections.\nWITH\nILLUSTRATIONS\nON THE\nMORAL SENSE.\n","id":"Hutcheson.EI"}],"texts":[{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.Pref","imported":true,"title":"Preface","breadcrumb":"Preface","published":[1728]},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP","imported":true,"title":"An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions","breadcrumb":"Essay on the Passions","published":[1728]},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI.IMS","imported":true,"title":"Illustrations upon the Moral Sense","breadcrumb":"Illustrations upon the Moral Sense","published":[1728]}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hutcheson","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":1725,"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hutcheson.IBV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1725],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Inquiry into Beauty and Virtue"},{"id":"Hutcheson.EI","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1728],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay and Illustrations"},{"id":"Hutcheson.LFV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"Letters Between the Late Mr. Gilbert Burnet and Mr. Hutchinson, Concerning the True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1735],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Burnet.LFV","breadcrumb":"Letters on the Foundation of Virtue"},{"id":"Hutcheson.RL","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"Reflections upon Laughter and Remarks on the Fable of Bees","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1750],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Reflections upon Laughter"}]}],"prev":{"id":"Hutcheson.IBV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1725],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Inquiry into Beauty and Virtue"},"next":{"id":"Hutcheson.LFV","forename":"Francis","surname":"Hutcheson","title":"Letters Between the Late Mr. Gilbert Burnet and Mr. Hutchinson, Concerning the True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness","birth":1694,"death":1746,"published":[1735],"nationality":"Irish/Scottish","sex":"Male","duplicate":"Burnet.LFV","breadcrumb":"Letters on the Foundation of Virtue"}}
