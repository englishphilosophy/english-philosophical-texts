The first which occur to any one are Desire of the grateful Perceptions, and Aversion to the uneasy, either for ourselves or others. If we would confine the word Affection to these two, which are entirely distinct from all Sensation, and directly incline the Mind to Action or Volition of Motion, we should have no Debate about the Number or Division of Affections. But since, by universal Custom, this Name is applied to other Modifications of the Mind, such as Joy, Sorrow, Despair, we may consider what universal Distinction can be assigned between these Modifications, and the several Sensations abovementioned; and we shall scarce find any other than this, that we call \"the direct immediate Perception of Pleasure or Pain from the present Object or Event, the Sensation: \"{Other Affections, wherein different from Sensation.} But we denote by the Affection or Passion some other \"Perceptions of Pleasure or Pain, not directly raised by the Presence or Operation of the Event or Object, but by our Reflection upon, or Apprehension of their present or future Existence; so that we expect or judge that the Object or Event will raise the direct Sensations in us.\" In beholding a regular Building we have the Sensation of Beauty; but upon our apprehending ourselves possessed of it, or that we can procure this pleasant Sensation when we please, we feel the Affection of Joy. When a Man has a Fit of the Gout, he has the painful Sensation; when he is not at present pained, yet apprehends a sudden return of it, he has the Affection of Sorrow, which might be called a Sort of Sensation: as the Physicians call many of our Passions internal Senses.","subId":"1","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When the word Passion is imagined to denote any thing different from the Affections, it includes a strong Brutal Impulse of the Will, sometimes without any distinct notions of Good, publick or private, attended with \"a confused Sensation either of Pleasure or Pain, occasioned or attended by some violent bodily Motions, which keeps the Mind much employed upon the present Affair, to the exclusion of every thing else, and prolongs or strengthens the Affection sometimes to such a degree, as to prevent all deliberate Reasoning about our Conduct.\"","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{General Desires, and particular Affections or Passions.} We have little reason to imagine, that all other Agents have such confused Sensations accompanying their Desires as we often have.

In like manner our publick Desires may be distinguished into the general calm Desire of the Happiness of others, or Aversion to their Misery upon Reflection; and the particular Affections or Passions of Love, Congratulation, Compassion, natural Affection. These particular Affections are found in many Tempers, where, through want of Reflection, the general calm Desires are not found: Nay, the former may be opposite to the latter, where they are found in the same Temper. Sometimes the calm Motion of the Will conquers the Passions, and sometimes is conquered by it. Thus Lust or Revenge may conquer the calm Affection toward private Good, and sometimes are conquered by it. Compassion will prevent the necessary Correction of a Child, or the use of a severe Cure, while the calm parental Affection is exciting to it. Sometimes the latter prevails over the former. All this is beatifully represented in the 9th book of [Plato's Republick]. We obtain Command over the particular Passions, principally by strengthning the general Desires through frequent Reflection, and making them habitual, so as to obtain Strength superior to the particular Passions.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Again, the calm publick Desires may be considered as \"they either regard the Good of particular Persons or Societies presented to our Senses; or that of some more abstracted or general Community, such as a Species or System.\" This latter sort we may call universal calm Benevolence. Now it is plain, that not only particular kind Passions, but even calm particular Benevolence do not always arise from, or necessarily presuppose, the universal Benevolence; both the former may be found in Persons of little Reflection, where the latter is wanting: And the former two may be opposite to the other, where they meet together in one Temper.

We need not imagine any innate Idea of Good in general, of infinite Good, or of the greatest Aggregate: Much less need we suppose any actual Inclination toward any of these, as the Cause or Spring of all particular Desires. It is enough to allow, \"that we are capable by enlarging, or by Abstraction, of coming to these Ideas: That we must, by the Constitution of our Nature, desire any apprehended Good which occurs a‐part from any Evil: That of two Objects inconsistent with each other, we shall desire that which seems to contain the greatest Moment of Good.\" So that it cannot be pronounced concerning any finite Good, that it shall necessarily engage our Pursuit; since the Agent may possibly have the Idea of a Greater, or see this to be inconsistent with some more valuable Object, or that it may bring upon him some prepollent Evil. The certain Knowledge of any of these Things, or probable Presumption of them, may stop the Pursuit of any finite Good. If this be any sort of Liberty, it must be allowed to be in Men, even by those who maintain \"the Desire or Will to be necessarily determined by the prepollent Motive;\" since this very Presumption may be a prepollent Motive, especially to those, who by frequent Attention make the Idea of the greatest Good always present to themselves on all important Occasions.

In like manner, \"Errors may be criminal, where there are sufficient Data or Objective Evidence for the Truth;\" since no Demonstration can lead to Error, and we can suspend our Assent to probable Arguments, till we have examined both Sides.

There are perhaps Orders of rational Beings also without these particular limited Attachments, to which our Natures are subjected; who may perhaps have no Parental Affection, Friendships, or Love to a Country, or to any special smaller Systems; but have Universal Good-will to all, and this solely proportioned to the moral Excellencies of the several Objects, without any other Bonds of Affection. There is probably an infinite Variety of Beings, of all possible Degrees, in which the Sum of Happiness exceeds that of Misery. We know that our State is absolutely Good, notwithstanding a considerable Mixture of Evil.

The Happiness of human Life cannot be promoted without Society and mutual Aid, even beyond a Family; our publick Affections must therefore be strengthned as well as the private, to keep a Ballance; so must also our Desires of Virtue and Honour. Anger, which some have thought an useless Passion, is really as necessary as the rest; since Men's Interests often seem to interfere with each other; and they are thereby led from Self‐Love to do the worst Injuries to their Fellows. There could not therefore be a wiser Contrivance to restrain Injuries, than to make every mortal some way formidable to an unjust Invader, by such a violent Passion.

If we have selfish Passions for our own Preservation, we have also publick Passions, which may engage us into vigorous and laborious Services to Offspring, Friends, Communities, Countries.

The Moment of every Event is thereby increased: as much as the Sensations of Sorrow add to our Misery, so much those of Joy add to our Happiness.

The Sensations of Anger in some Tempers are violent above their proportion; those of Ambition, Avarice, desire of sensual Pleasure, and even of natural Affection, in several Dispositions, possess the Mind too much, and make it incapable of attending to any thing else. Scarce any one Temper is always constant and uniform in its Passions. The best State of human Nature possible, might require a Diversity of Passions and Inclinations, for the different Occupations necessary for the whole: But the Disorder seems to be much greater than is requisite for this End. Custom, Education, Habits, and Company, may often contribute much to this Disorder, however its Original may be ascribed to some more universal Cause. But it is not so great, but that human Life is still a desireable State, having a superiority of Goodness and Happiness. Nor, if we apply ourselves to it, does it hinder us from discerning that just Ballance and Oeconomy, which would constitute the most happy State of each Person, and promote the greatest Good in the whole.","subId":"72","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.72"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Dispositions to some particular Passions.} Let Physicians or Anatomists explain the several Motions in the Fluids or Solids of the Body, which accompany any Passion; or the Temperaments of Body which either make Men prone to any Passion, or are brought upon us by the long Continuance, or frequent Returns of it. It is only to our Purpose in general to observe, \"that probably certain Motions in the Body do accompany every Passion by a fixed Law of Nature; and alternately, that Temperament which is apt to receive or prolong these Motions in the Body, does influence our Passions to heighten or prolong them.\" Thus a certain Temperament may be brought upon the Body, by its being frequently put into Motion by the Passions of Anger, Joy, Love, or Sorrow; and the Continuance of this Temperament shall make Men prone to the several Passions for the future. We find ourselves after a long Fit of Anger or Sorrow, in an uneasy State, even when we are not reflecting on the particular Occasion of our Passion. During this State, every trifle shall be apt to provoke or deject us. On the contrary, after good Success, after strong friendly Passions, or a State of Mirth, some considerable Injuries or Losses, which at other times would have affected us very much, shall be overlooked, or meekly received, or at most but slightly resented; perhaps because our Bodies are not fit easily to receive these Motions which are constituted the Occasion of the uneasy Sensations of Anger. This Diversity of Temper every one has felt, who reflects on himself at different Times. In some Tempers it will appear like Madness. Whether the only Seat of these Habits, or the Occasion rather of these Dispositions, be in the Body; or whether the Soul itself does not, by frequent Returns of any Passion acquire some greater Disposition to receive and retain it again, let those determine, who sufficiently understand the Nature of either the one or the other.","subId":"73","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.2.73"},{"type":"note","content":"Whoever would see subtile Divisions of those Sensations, let him read Malebranche's [Recherche de la Verite, B. v. c. 3.] Together with these Sensations there are also some strong Propensities distinct from any rational Desire: About which see [Sect. 3.
