The only way to effect this is, \"a constant Attention of Mind, an habitual Discipline over ourselves, and a fixed Resolution to stop all Action, before a calm Examination of every Circumstance attending it; more particularly, the real Values of external Objects, and the moral Qualities or Tempers of rational Agents, about whom our Affections may be employed.\" This Power we may obtain over ourselves, by a frequent Consideration of the great Calamities, and pernicious Actions, to which even the best of our Passions may lead us, by the confused Sensations, and fantastick Associations of Ideas which attend them: Thus we may raise an habitual Suspicion and Dread of every violent Passion, which, recurring along with them continually, may in some measure counter‐ballance their Propensities and confused Sensations. This Discipline of our Passions is in general necessary: The unkind or destructive Affections, our Anger, Hatred, or Aversion to rational Agents, seem to need it most; but there is also a great Necessity for it, even about the tender and benign Affections, lest we should be hurried into universal and absolute Evil, by the Appearance of particular Good: And consequently it must be of the highest Importance to all, to strengthen as much as possible, by frequent Meditation and Reflection, the calm Desires either private or publick, rather than the particular Passions, and to make the calm universal Benevolence superior to them.","subId":"2","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Resignation of sensual Pleasures.} That the necessary Resignation of other Pleasures may be the more easy, we must frequently suggest to ourselves these Considerations above-mentioned. \"External Pleasures are short and transitory, leave no agreeable Reflection, and are no manner of Advantage to us when they are past; we are no better than if we had wanted them altogether.\"","subId":"3","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In like manner, \"past Pains give us no unpleasant Reflection, nor are we the worse for having endured them. If they are violent, our Existence will probably be short; if not, they are tolerable, or allow long Intervals of Ease.\" Let us join to these a stoical Consideration; \"that external Pains give us a noble Opportunity of moral Pleasures in Fortitude, and Submission to the Order of the whole, if we bear them resolutely; but if we fret under them, we do not alleviate the Suffering, but rather increase it by Discontent or Sullenness.\" When external Pains must be endured voluntarily to avoid moral Evil, we must, as much as possible, present to ourselves the moral Species itself, with the publick Good to ensue, the Honour and Approbation to be expected from all good Men, the Deity, and our own Hearts, if we continue firm; and on the contrary, the Remorse, Shame and Apprehension of future Punishments, if we yield to this Temptation.","subId":"4","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"How necessary it is to break off the vain Associations of moral Ideas, from the Objects of external Senses, will also easily appear.

Men who are at ease, and of as irregular Imaginations as ourselves, may admire and praise our Magnificence; but those who need more durable Services, will never think themselves much obliged.

The Wretch who rises no higher in this Passion than the mean sensual Gratification, is abhorred by every one: But these sublimer Sensations and Passions do often so fill the Imaginations of the Amorous, that they are unawares led into the most contemptible and cruel Conduct which can be imagined. When for some trifling transitory Sensations, which they might have innocently enjoyed along with the highest moral Pleasures in Marriage, they expose the very Person they love and admire to the deepest Infamy and Sorrow, to the Contempt of the World, to perpetual Confusion, Remorse, and Anguish; or, to what is worse, an Insensibility of all Honour or Shame, Virtue or Vice, Good or Evil, to be the Scorn and Aversion of the World; and all this coloured over with the gay Notions of Pleasantry, Genteelness, Politeness, Courage, high Enjoyment of Life.","subId":"7","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Would Men allow themselves a little Time to reflect on the whole Effect of such capricious Pursuits, the Anguish and Distraction of Mind which these Sallies of Pleasure give to Husbands, Fathers, Brothers; would they consider how they themselves would resent such Treatment of a Wife, a Child, a Sister; how much deeper such Distresses are, than those trifling Losses or Damages, for which we think it just to bring the Authors of them to the Gallows; sure none but a thorough Villain could either practice or approve the one more than the other.","subId":"8","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A wise Man in his Oeconomy, must do much even in Complaisance to the Follies of others, as well as his own Conveniency, to support that general good Opinion which must be maintained by those who would be useful to the Publick.

If indeed what is saved in private Expences, be employed in generous Offices, there is little danger of this Charge. Such a Medium may be kept as to be above Censure, and yet below any Affectation of Honour or Distinction in these matters. If one corrects his own Imagination in these things, he will be in no danger of doing any thing pernicious to please others. He is still in a State fit to judge of the real Importance of every thing which occurs to him, and will gratify the false Relish of others, no farther than it is consistent with, and subservient to some nobler Views.","subId":"9","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{Conduct necessary about the Pleasures of Imagination.} To make the Pleasures of Imagination a constant Source of Delight, as they seem intended in the Frame of our Nature, with no hazard of Pain, it is necessary to keep the Sense free from foreign Ideas of Property, and the Desire of Distinction, as much as possible. If this can be done, we may receive Pleasure from every Work of Nature or Art around us. We enjoy not only the whole of Nature, but the united Labours of all about us. To prevent the Idea of Property, let us consider \"how little the Proprietor enjoys more than the Spectator: Wherein is he the better or the happier?\" The Poet, or the Connoisseur, who judges nicely of the Perfection of the Works of Art, or the Beauties of Nature, has generally a higher Taste than the Possessor. The magnificent Palace, the grand Apartments, the Vistas, the Fountains, the Urns, the Statues, the Grottos and Arbours, are exposed either in their own Nature, or by the Inclination of the Proprietor, to the Enjoyment of others. The Pleasure of the Proprietor depends upon the Admiration of others; he robs himself of his chief Enjoyment, if he excludes Spectators: Nay, may not a Taste for Nature be acquired, giving greater Delight than the Observation of Art? \n\nDeterius Lybicis olet, aut nitet, Herba lapillis? \n Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere Plumbum, \n Quam que per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum? \n Nempe inter varias nutritur Sylva Columnas, \n Laudaturque Domus, longos qua prospicit Agros. \n Naturam expellas surca licet, usque recurret.

If these Studies be only matter of Amusement and Speculation, instead of leading us into a constant Discipline over ourselves, to correct our Hearts, and to guide our Actions, we are not much better employed, than if we had been studying some useless Relations of Numbers, or Calculations of Chances.","subId":"12","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"There is not indeed any part of Knowledge which can be called entirely useless.

Grandeur, Beauty, Order, Harmony, wherever they occur, raise an Opinion of a Mind, of Design, and Wisdom. Every thing great, regular, or proportioned, excites Veneration, either toward itself, if we imagine it animated, if not animated, toward some apprehended Cause. No Determination of our Mind is more natural than this, no Effect more universal.

We may fall into a Thousand vain Reasonings: foolish limited Notions of Divinity may be formed, as attached to the particular Places or Objects, which strike us in the most lively manner. Custom, Prejudice of Sense or Education, may confirm some foolish Opinion about the Nature or Cause of these Appearances: But wherever a superior Mind, a governing Intention or Design is imagined, there Religion begins in its most simple Form, and an inward Devotion arises. Our Nature is as much determined to this, as to any other Perception or Affection.

The Order of Nature will suggest many Confirmations of this. We must conclude some Worship acceptable, and some Expressions of Gratitude as our Duty. The Conceptions of the Deity must be various, according to the different Degrees of Attention and Reasoning in the Observers, and their own Tempers and Affections. Imagining the divine Mind, as cruel, wrathful, or capricious, must be a perpetual Source of Dread and Horror; and will be apt to raise a Resemblance of Temper in the Worshipper, with its attendant Misery. A contrary Idea of the Divinty, as good, and kind, delighting in universal Happiness, and ordering all Events of the Universe to this End, as it is the most delightful Contemplation, so it fills the good Mind with a constant Security and Hope, amidst either publick Disorders, or private Calamities.","subId":"17","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To find out which of these two Representations of the Deity is the true one, we must consult the Universe, the Effect of his Power, and the Scene of his Actions.

Many of them indeed do not pursue the private Good of the Agent; nay, many of them, in various Cases, seem to tend to his detriment, by concerning him violently in the Fortunes of others, in their Adversity, as well as their Prosperity. But they all aim at good, either private or publick: and by them each particular Agent is made, in a great measure, subservient to the good of the whole. Mankind are thus insensibly linked together, and make one great System, by an invisible Union. He who voluntarily continues in this Union, and delights in employing his Power for his Kind, makes himself happy: He who does not continue this Union freely, but affects to break it, makes himself wretched; nor yet can he break the Bonds of Nature. His publick Sense, his Love of Honour, and the very Necessities of his Nature, will continue to make him depend upon his System, and engage him to serve it, whether he inclines to it or not.

But if it appears, \"that the general Laws are wisely constituted, and that it is necessary to the Good of a System of such Agents, to be under the Influence of general Laws, upon which there is occasion for Prudence and Activity;\" the particular Pains occasioned by a necessary Law of Sensation, can be no Objection against the Goodness of the Author.

Can we then repine at the friendly Admonitions of Nature, joined with some Austerity, when we see that they are scarce sufficient to restrain us from Ruin? The same may be said of the Pain of other kinds. Shame and Remorse are never to be called too severe, while so many are not sufficiently restrained by them. Our Compassion and friendly Sense of Sorrow, what are they else but the Alarms and Exhortations of a kind impartial Father, to engage his Children to relieve a distressed Brother?

How easy had it been to have contrived some necessary Engines of Misery without any use; some Member of no other service but to be matter of Torment; Senses incapable of bearing the surrounding Objects without Pain; Eyes pained with the Light; a Palate offended with the Fruits of the Earth; a Skin as tender as the Coats of the Eye, and yet some more furious Pain forcing us to bear these Torments? Human Society might have been made as uneasy as the Company of Enemies, and yet a perpetual more violent Motive of Fear might have forced us to bear it. Malice, Rancour, Distrust, might have been our natural Temper. Our Honour and Self‐Approbation might have depended upon Injuries; and the Torments of others been made our Delight, which yet we could not have enjoyed thro' perpetual Fear. Many such Contrivances we may easily conceive, whereby an evil Mind could have gratified his Malice by our Misery.

Both their Minds and Bodies are soon fitted to their State. The Farmer and Labourer, when they enjoy the bare Necessaries of Life, are easy. They have often more correct Imaginations, through Necessity and Experience, than others can acquire by Philosophy. This Thought is indeed a poor Excuse for a base selfish Oppressor, who, imagining Poverty a great Misery, bears hard upon those in a low Station of Life, and deprives them of the common Necessaries, or even of the natural Coneniencies of Life.

Could we raise our Goodness even to an higher Pitch, and consider the Injurious as our Fellow-Members in this great intellectual Body, whose Interest and Happiness it becomes us to promote, as much as we can consistently with that of others, and not to despise, scorn, or cut them off, because of every Weakness, Deformity, or lighter Disorder;\" we might bring our selves to that divine Conduct, of even returning good for evil.","subId":"33","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.33"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In like manner, our Emulation, Jealousy, or Envy, might be restrained in a great measure, by a constant Resolution of bearing always in our Minds the lovely Side of every Character: \"The compleatly Evil are as rare as the perfectly Virtuous: There is something amiable almost in every one.\" Could we enure ourselves constantly to dwell on these things, we might often bear patiently the Success of a Rival, nay, sometimes even rejoice in it, be more happy ourselves, and turn him into a real Friend.

Our moral Sense thus regulated, and constantly followed in our Actions, may be the most constant Source of the most stable Pleasure. The same Conduct is always the most probable Means of obtaining the Pleasures of Honour. If there be a Distinction between Truth and Falshood, Truth must be stronger than Falshood: It must be more probable that Truth will generally prevail; that the real good Tendency of our Actions, and the Wisdom of our Intentions will be known; and Misrepresentations or partial Views will vanish. Our Desire of Honour is not confined to our present State. The Prospect of future Glory is a strong Motive of Action. And thus the Time, in which our Character may have the hazard of obtaining Justice, has no other Limits than those of the Existence of rational Natures. Whereas, partial Notions of Virtue, and partial Conduct, have no other Foundation for Self‐Approbation, than our Ignorance, Error, or Inadvertence; nor for Honour, than the like Ignorance, Error, or Inadvertence of others.","subId":"35","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.35"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"That we may not be engaged into any thing contrary to the publick Good, or to the true Schemes of Virtue, by the Desire of false Honour, or Fear of false Shame, it is of great use to examine the real Dignity of those we converse with, and to confine our Intimacies to the truly virtuous and wise. From such we can expect no Honour, but according to our sincere Pursuit of the publick Good; nor need we ever fear any Shame in such a Course. But above all, did we frequently, and in the most lively manner, present to ourselves that great, and wise, and good Mind, which presides over the Universe, sees every Action, and knows the true Character and Disposition of every Heart, approving nothing but sincere Goodness and Integrity; did we consider that the time will come, when we shall be as conscious of his Presence, as we are of our own Existence; as sensible of his Approbation or Condemnation, as we are of the Testimony of our own Hearts; when we shall be engaged in a Society of Spirits, stripped of these Prejudices and false Notions which so often attend us in Flesh and Blood, how should we despise that Honour which is from Men, when opposite to the truest Honour from God himself?","subId":"36","id":"Hutcheson.EI.ENP.6.36"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"{The Desires of Wealth and Power.} Concerning the Desires of Wealth and Power, besides what was suggested above to allay their Violence, from considering the small Addition commonly made to the Happiness of the Possessor, by the greatest Degrees of them, and the Uncertainty of their Continuance; if we have obtained any share of them, let us examine their true Use, and what is the best Enjoyment of them. \n\n——Quid asper \n Utile Nummus habet?
