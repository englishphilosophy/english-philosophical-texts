Part one, [De Corpore], was published in 1655, followed by part two, [De Homine], in 1658. Both of these were in Latin; Hobbes never published [De Homine] in English, but an English version of [De Corpore] appeared in 1656, as [The Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body].","texts":[],"forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","author":"Thomas Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[]}
