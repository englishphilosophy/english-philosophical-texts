And first for the Pleasures of the Body which affect the Sense of Touch and Tast, as far forth as they be Organical, their Conceptions are Sense: so also is the Pleasure of all Exonerations of Nature: All which Passions I have before named, Sensual Pleasures; and their contrary, Sensual Pains: to which also may be added the Pleasures and Displeasures of Odours, if any of them shall be found Organical, which for the most Part they are not, as appeareth by this Experience which every Man hath, that the same Smells, when they seem to proceed from others, displease, though they proceed from our selves; but when we think they proceed from our selves, they displease not, though they come from others: the Displeasure of this is a Conception of Hurt thereby from those Odours, as being unwholesom, and is therefore a Conception of Evil to come, and not present. Concerning the Delight of Hearing, it is diverse, and the Organ it self not affected thereby: Simple Sounds please by Æquality, as the Sound of a Bell or Lute: insomuch as it seems, an Equality continued by the Percussion of the Object upon the Ear, is Pleasure; the Contrary is called Harshness, such as is Grating, and some other Sounds, which do not always affect the Body, but only sometime, and that with a Kind of Horrour beginning at the Teeth. Harmony, or many Sounds together agreeing, please by the same Reason as the Vnison, which is the Sound of equal Strings equally stretched. Sounds that differ in any Height, please by Inequality and Æquality alternate, that is to say, the higher Note striketh twice, for one Stroke of the other, whereby they strike together every second Time; as is well proved by Galileo, in the first Dialogue concerning local Motion: where he also sheweth, that two Sounds differing a fifth, delight the Ear by an Æquality of striking after two Inequalities; for the higher Note striketh the Ear thrice, while the other strikes but twice. In like Manner he sheweth wherein consisteth the Pleasure of Concord, and the Displeasure of Discord, in other Difference of Notes. There is yet another Pleasure and Displeasure of Sounds, which consisteth in Consequence of one Note after another, diversified both by Accent and Measure; whereof that which pleaseth is called Air; but for what Reason Succession in Tone and Measure is more Air than another, I confess I know not; but I conjecture the Reason to be, for that some of them imitate and revive some Passion which otherwise we take no Notice of, and the other not; for no Air pleaseth but for a time, no more doth Imitation. Also the Pleasures of the Eye consist in a certain Æquality of Colour: for Light, the most glorious of all Colours, is made by equal Operation of the Object; whereas Colour is perturbed, that is to say, unequal Light, as hath been said, Chap. 2. Sect. 8. And therefore Colours, the more Equality is in them, the more resplendent they are: and as Harmony is pleasure to the Ear, which consisteth of divers Sounds; so perhaps may some Mixture of divers Colours be Harmony to the Eye, more than another Mixture. There is yet another Delight by the Ear, which happeneth onely to Men of skill in Musick, which is of another Nature, (and not as these) Conception of the present, but rejoycing of their own Skill; of which nature are the Passions of which I am to speak next.","subId":"2","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Conception of the future, is but a Supposition of the same, proceeding from Remembrance of what is past; and we so far conceive that any Thing will be hereafter, as we know there is something at the present that hath Power to produce it: and that any Thing hath Power now to produce another Thing hereafter, we cannot conceive, but by Remembrance that it hath produced the like heretofore. Wherefore all Conception of future, is Conception of Power able to produce something. Whosoever therefore expecteth Pleasure to come, must conceive withal some Power in himself by which the same may be attained. And because the Passions, whereof I am to speak next, consist in Conception of the future, that is to say, in Conception of Power past, and the Act to come; before I go any further, I must in the next Place speak somewhat concerning this Power.","subId":"3","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this Power I mean the same with the Faculties of the Body, Nutritive, Generative, Motive, and of the Mind, Knowledge; and besides these, such further Power as by them is acquired, viz. Riches, Place of Authority, Friendship or Favour, and Good Fortune; which last is really nothing else but the Favour of God Almighty. The Contraries of these are Impotencies, Infirmities, or Defects of the said Powers respectively. And because the Power of one Man resisteth and hindereth the Effects of the Power of another, Power simply is no more, but the Excess of the Power of one above that of another: for equal Powers opposed, destroy one another; and such their Opposition is called Contention.","subId":"4","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Signs by which we know our own Power, are those Actions which proceed from the same; and the Signs by which other Men know it, are such Actions, Gesture, Countenance and Speech, as usually such Powers produce: and the Acknowledgement of Power is called Honour; and to honour a Man inwardly, is to conceive or acknowledge that that Man hath the odds or Excess of that Power above him with whom he contendeth or compareth himself. And honourable are those Signs for which one Man acknowledgeth Power or Excess above his Concurrent in another: As for Example, Beauty of Person, consisting in a lively Aspect of the Countenance, and other Signs of Natural Heat, are honourable, being Signs precedent of Power generative, and much Issue; as also, general Reputation among those of the other Sex, because Signs consequent of the same. And Actions proceeding from Strength of Body, and open Force, are honourable, as Signs consequent of Power motive, such as are Victory in Battel or Duel; A d'avoir tué son homme. Also to adventure upon great Exploits and Danger, as being a Sign consequent of Opinion of our own Strength, and that Opinion a Sign of the Strength it self. And to teach or perswade are honourable, because they be Signs of Knowledge. And Riches are honourable; as Signs of the Power that acquired them: And Gifts, Cost, and Magnificence of Houses, Apparel, and the like, are honourable, as Signs of Riches. And Nobility is honourable by Reflection, as a Sign of Power in the Ancestors: And Authority, because a Sign of the Strength, Wisdom, Favour or Riches by which it is attained. And Good Fortune or casual Prosperity is honourable, because a Sign of the Favour of God, to whom is to be ascribed all that cometh to us by Fortune, no less than that we attain unto by Industry. And the Contraries and Defects of these Signs are dishonourable; and according to the Signs of Honour and Dishonour, so we estimate and make the Value or Worth of a Man: for so much worth is every Thing, as a Man will give for the Use of all it can do.","subId":"5","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Signs of Honour are those by which we perceive that one Man acknowledgeth the Power and Worth of another; such as these, to praise, to magnifie, to bless, to call happy, to pray or supplicate to, to thank, to offer unto or present, to obey, to hearken unto with Attention, to speak to with Consideration, to approach unto in decent Manner, to keep Distance from, to give way to, and the like, which are the Honour the Inferior giveth to the Superiour. But the Signs of Honour from the Superiour to the Inferiour, are such as these; to praise or prefer him before his Concurrent, to hear more willingly, to speak to him more familiarly, to admit him nearer, to employ him rather, to ask his advice rather, to take his opinions, and to give him any Gifts rather than Money; or if Money, so much as may not imply his Need of a little: for Need of a little is greater Poverty than Need of much. And this is enough for Examples of the Signs of Honour and Power.","subId":"6","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Reverence is the Conception we have concerning another, that he hath the Power to do unto us both Good and Hurt, but not the Will to do us Hurt.","subId":"7","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In the Pleasure men have, or Displeasure from the Signs of Honour or Dishonour done unto them, consisteth the Nature of the Passions, whereof we are to speak in the next Chapter.","subId":"8","id":"Hobbes.HN.8.8"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hobbes","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":1650,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"},{"id":"Hobbes.CP","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore Politico; or, The Elements of Law, Moral and Politick","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore Politico"},{"id":"Hobbes.Civ","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Cive; Or, Philosophicall Rudiments Concerning Government and Society","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Cive"},{"id":"Hobbes.L","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme, & Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civill","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1651],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Leviathan"},{"id":"Hobbes.LN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Of Libertie and Necessitie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1654],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Libertie and Necessitie"},{"id":"Hobbes.Cor","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"De Corpore; Or, Elements of Philosophy, The First Section, Concerning Body","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1656],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"De Corpore"},{"id":"Hobbes.B","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Behemoth; Or, An Epitome of the Civil Wars of England, from 1640 to 1660","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1679],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Behemoth"},{"id":"Hobbes.AB","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"An Answer to a Book published by Dr. Bramhall","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1682],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Answer to Bramhall"}]},{"id":"Hobbes.HN","forename":"Thomas","surname":"Hobbes","title":"Humane Nature; or, the Fundamental Elements of Policie","birth":1588,"death":1679,"published":[1650],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Humane Nature"}],"prev":{"id":"Hobbes.HN.7","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 7","breadcrumb":"Chapter 7","published":[1650]},"next":{"id":"Hobbes.HN.9","imported":true,"title":"Chapter 9","breadcrumb":"Chapter 9","published":[1650]}}
