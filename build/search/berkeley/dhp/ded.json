But as Your Name is prefixed to this Treatise, with an Intention to do Honour to myself alone, I shall only say, that I am encouraged, by the Favour You have treated me with, to address these Papers to Your Lordship. And I was the more ambitious of doing this, because a Philosophical Treatise cou'd not so properly be addressed to any one, as to a Person of Your Lordship's Character, who, to Your other valuable Distinctions, have added the Knowledge and Relish of Philosophy. I am, with the greatest Respect, \n     MY LORD,   Your Lordship's most Obedient, and \n     Most Humble Servant, \n       George Berkeley.","subId":"1","id":"Berkeley.DHP.Ded.1"}]}
