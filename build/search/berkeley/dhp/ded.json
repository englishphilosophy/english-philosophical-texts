But as Your Name is prefixed to this Treatise, with an Intention to do Honour to myself alone, I shall only say, that I am encouraged, by the Favour You have treated me with, to address these Papers to Your Lordship. And I was the more ambitious of doing this, because a Philosophical Treatise cou'd not so properly be addressed to any one, as to a Person of Your Lordship's Character, who, to Your other valuable Distinctions, have added the Knowledge and Relish of Philosophy. I am, with the greatest Respect, \n     MY LORD,   Your Lordship's most Obedient, and \n     Most Humble Servant, \n       George Berkeley.","subId":"1","id":"Berkeley.DHP.Ded.1"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Berkeley","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":1709,"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Berkeley.ETV","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1709],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essay Towards a Theory of Vision"},{"id":"Berkeley.THK","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1710],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise Concerning Human Knowledge"},{"id":"Berkeley.PO","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Passive Obedience","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1712],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Passive Obedience"},{"id":"Berkeley.DHP","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1713],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous"},{"id":"Berkeley.A","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Alciphron; or, the Minute Philosopher","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1732],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Alciphron"},{"id":"Berkeley.TV","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"The Theory of Vision","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1733],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Theory of Vision"},{"id":"Berkeley.Q","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"The Querist","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1735],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Querist"}]},{"id":"Berkeley.DHP","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1713],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous"}],"prev":{"id":"Berkeley.DHP","forename":"George","surname":"Berkeley","title":"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous","birth":1685,"death":1753,"published":[1713],"nationality":"Irish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous"},"next":{"id":"Berkeley.DHP.Pref","imported":true,"title":"Preface","breadcrumb":"Preface","published":[1713]}}
