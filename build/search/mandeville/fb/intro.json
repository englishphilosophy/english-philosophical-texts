In 1714, he published the poem again, together with a preface, An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue, and several Remarks on the poem, all under the title of The Fable of the Bees. Our copytext is the 3rd edition of 1724, to which two additional essays were added. The text here derives from F. B.

As for my Part, without any Compliment to the Courteous Reader, or my self, I believe Man (besides Skin, Flesh, Bones, &c. that are obvious to the Eye) to be a compound of various Passions, that all of them, as they are provoked and come uppermost, govern him by turns, whether he will or no. To shew, that these Qualifications, which we all pretend to be asham'd of, are the great support of a flourishing Society, has been the subject of the foregoing Poem. But there being some Passages in it seemingly Paradoxical, I have in the Preface promised some explanatory Remarks on it; which to render more useful, I have thought fit to enquire, how Man, no better qualify'd, might yet by his own Imperfections be taught to distinguish between Virtue and Vice: And here I must desire the Reader once for all to take notice, that when I say Men, I mean neither Jews nor Christians; but meer Man, in the State of Nature and Ignorance of the true Deity.","subId":"1","id":"Mandeville.FB.Intro.1"}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Mandeville","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":1705,"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Mandeville.THP","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Passions","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1711],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Treatise of Hypochondriack Passions"},{"id":"Mandeville.FB","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"The Fable of the Bees; or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1714],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Fable of the Bees"},{"id":"Mandeville.FTR","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"Free Thoughts on Religion, the Church, and National Happiness","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1720],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Free Thoughts on Religion"},{"id":"Mandeville.P2","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"The Fable of the Bees, Part II","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1729],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Fable of the Bees, Part II"},{"id":"Mandeville.EOH","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour, and the Usefulness of Christianity in War","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1732],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Enquiry into the Origin of Honour"},{"id":"Mandeville.LD","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"A Letter to Dion, Occasion'd by his Book Call'd Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1732],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Letter to Dion"}]},{"id":"Mandeville.FB","forename":"Bernard","surname":"Mandeville","title":"The Fable of the Bees; or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits","birth":1670,"death":1733,"published":[1714],"nationality":"English [Dutch]","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Fable of the Bees"}],"prev":{"id":"Mandeville.FB.GH","imported":true,"title":"The Grumbling Hive: or, Knaves turn'd Honest","breadcrumb":"Grumbling Hive","published":[1705]},"next":{"id":"Mandeville.FB.EMV","imported":true,"title":"An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue","breadcrumb":"Enquiry into Moral Virtue","published":[1714]}}
