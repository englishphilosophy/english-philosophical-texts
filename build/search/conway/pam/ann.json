It was then translated from the Latin back into English, and published in 1692 in London. As the original manuscript sadly does not survive, we have no option but to take this third-hand 1692 version as our copytext. Our general principle on this site is to include only works originally published in the author’s own English, but the unusual history of this work seemed to merit making an exception.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A34395.0001.001/1:5.1?rgn=div2;view=fulltext","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"Annotations on this first Chapter.\n","id":"Conway.PAM.Ann"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"THE Ancient Hypothesis of the Hebrews, as to what pertains to the latter Contents of this Chapter, is this:","subId":"i","id":"Conway.PAM.Ann.i"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Seeing God was of all the most exceeding great and infinite Light, and yet the chiefest Good: For this Reason he would make Creatures to whom he might communicate himself: But these could in no wise bear the exceeding greatness of his Light: And hereunto belong those Scripture sayings, God dwelleth in an inapproachable Light.

Secondly, God is the same as in the Messias. Thirdly, That God is the same, as when with the Messias in the Creatures fitted by the least degree of Light to the perception of his Creatures.
