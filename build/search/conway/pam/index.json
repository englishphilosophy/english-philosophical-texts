It was then translated from the Latin back into English, and published in 1692 in London. As the original manuscript sadly does not survive, we have no option but to take this third-hand 1692 version as our copytext. Our general principle on this site is to include only works originally published in the author’s own English, but the unusual history of this work seemed to merit making an exception.","sourceUrl":"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A34395.0001.001?view=toc","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"THE\nPRINCIPLES\nOf the most Ancient and Modern\nPHILOSOPHY\nCONCERNING\nGod, Christ, and the Creatures, viz. of Spirit and Matter in general, whereby may be resolved all those Problems or Difficulties, which neither by the School nor Common Modern Philosophy, nor by the Cartesian, Hobbesian, or Spinosian could be discussed.
