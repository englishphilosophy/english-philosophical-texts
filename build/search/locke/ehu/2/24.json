So by putting together several particular Substances, it makes collective Ideas of Substances, as a Troop, an Army, a Swarm, a City, a Fleet; each of which, every one finds, that he represents to his own Mind, by one Idea, in one view; and so under that Notion, considers the Things themselves as perfectly one, as one Ship, or one Atom. Nor is it harder to conceive, how an Army of ten Thousand Men, should make one Idea, than how a Man should make one Idea; it being as easie to the Mind, to unite into one, the Idea of a great number of Men, and consider it as one; as it is to unite into one particular, all the distinct Ideas, that make up the composition of a Man, and consider them altogether as one","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.2.24.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Amongst such kind of collective Ideas, are to be counted most part of artificial Things, at least such of them as are made up of distinct Substances: And, in truth, if we consider all these collective Ideas aright, as ARMY, Constellation, Universe, as they are united into so many single Ideas, they are but the artificial Draughts of the Mind, bringing things very remote, and independent one from another, into one view, the better to contemplate, and discourse of them, united into one conception, and signified by one name. For there are no Things so remote, nor so contrary, which the Mind cannot, by this art of Composition, bring into one Idea, as is visible in that signified by the name Universe.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.2.24.3"}]}
