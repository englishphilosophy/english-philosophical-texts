The copytext for this version is the 4th edition of 1700, which is the last edition to be printed in Locke’s lifetime, and contains several changes and additions. The text is derived from a transcription of the first edition from EEBO-TCP. Several changes are being made to this source, to bring the text in line with the 1700 edition.","forename":"John","surname":"Locke","author":"John Locke","birth":1632,"death":1704,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"CHAP. IX.\nOf our Knowledge of Existence.\n","id":"Locke.EHU.4.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"HItherto we have only considered the Essences of Things, which being only abstract Ideas, and thereby removed in our Thoughts from particular Existence, (that being the proper Operation of the Mind, in Abstraction, to consider an Idea under no other Existence, but what it has in the Understanding,) gives us no Knowledge of real Existence at all. Where by the way we take notice, that universal Propositions, of whose Truth or Falshood we can have certain Knowledge, concern not Existence; and farther, that all particular Affirmations or Negations, that would not be certain if they were made general, are only concerning Existence; they declaring only the accidental Union or Separation of Ideas in Things existing, which in their abstract Natures, have no known necessary Union or Repugnancy.","subId":"1","id":"Locke.EHU.4.9.1"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But leaving the Nature of Propositions, and different ways of Predication to be considered more at large in another place, Let us proceed now to enquire concerning our Knowledge of the Existence of Things, and how we come by it. I say then, that we have the Knowledge of our own Existence by Intuition; of the Existence of God by Demonstration, and of other Things by Sensation.","subId":"2","id":"Locke.EHU.4.9.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As for our own Existence, we perceive it so plainly, and so certainly, that it neither needs, nor is capable of any proof. For nothing can be more evident to us, than our own Existence. I think, I reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can any of these be more evident to me, than my own Existence? If I doubt of all other Things, that very doubt makes me perceive my own Existence, and will not suffer me to doubt of that. For if I know I feel Pain, it is evident, I have as certain a Perception of my own Existence, as of the Existence of the Pain I feel: Or if I know I doubt, I have as certain a Perception of the Existence of the thing doubting, as of that Thought, which I call doubt. Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence, and an internal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning or Thinking, we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and in this Matter, come not short of the highest degree of Certainty.","subId":"3","id":"Locke.EHU.4.9.3"}]}
