Shortly after, Collins published a [Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell], as a direct response to Clarke's criticisms.

They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","author":"Samuel Clarke","birth":1675,"death":1729,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Fourth Defense\nOf an ARGUMENT made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell, to prove the Immateriality and Natural Immortality of the SOUL."}]}
