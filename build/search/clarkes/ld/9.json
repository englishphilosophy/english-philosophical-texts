Shortly after, Collins published a [Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell], as a direct response to Clarke's criticisms. A series of public letters between Clarke and Collins followed over the next few years, furthering the debate. They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","blocks":[{"type":"paragraph","content":"A Fourth Defense\nOf an ARGUMENT made use of in a Letter to Mr Dodwell, to prove the Immateriality and Natural Immortality of the SOUL."}],"texts":[],"ancestors":[{"id":"Collins","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":1707,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Collins.LD","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","breadcrumb":"Letters to Mr Dodwell"},{"id":"Collins.EUR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"An Essay concerning the Use of Reason","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1707],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Essay concerning the Use of Reason"},{"id":"Collins.DFT","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Discourse of Free-Thinking"},{"id":"Collins.FDF","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Farther Discourse of Free-Thinking","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1713],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Farther Discourse of Free-Thinking"},{"id":"Collins.IHL","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Philosophical Inquiry concerning Human Liberty","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1717],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Inquiry concerning Human Liberty"},{"id":"Collins.DCR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Discourse on the Grounds and Reason of the Christian Religion","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1724],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Discourse on Christian Religion"},{"id":"Collins.DLN","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"A Dissertation on Libery and Necessity","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1729],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Dissertation on Libery and Necessity"}]},{"id":"Collins.LD","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"Letters to Mr Dodwell, with Clarke's Defences and Collin's Answers","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1706,1707,1708],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","breadcrumb":"Letters to Mr Dodwell"}],"prev":{"id":"Collins.LD.8","duplicate":"ClarkeS.LD","title":"An Answer to Mr. Clark's Third Defence of his Letter to Mr. Dodwell","breadcrumb":"Collins's Third Reply","published":[1708]},"next":{"id":"Collins.EUR","forename":"Anthony","surname":"Collins","title":"An Essay concerning the Use of Reason","birth":1676,"death":1729,"published":[1707],"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","breadcrumb":"Essay concerning the Use of Reason"}}
