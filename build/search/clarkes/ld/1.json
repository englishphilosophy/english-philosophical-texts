Shortly after, Collins published a [Letter to the Learned Mr. Henry Dodwell], as a direct response to Clarke's criticisms.

They were never published as a set, but it was thought convenient to reproduce them here in that fashion.","forename":"Samuel","surname":"Clarke","author":"Samuel Clarke","birth":1675,"death":1729,"nationality":"English","sex":"Male","publisher":"English Philosophical Texts","pubPlace":"University of Oxford","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"A Letter to Mr Dodwell;\nWherein all the Arguments of his Epistolary Discourse against the Immortality of the SOUL are particularly answered, and the Judgment of the Fathers concerning that Matter truly represented.","id":"ClarkeS.LD.1"}]}
