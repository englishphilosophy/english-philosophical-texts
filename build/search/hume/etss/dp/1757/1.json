The imagination or understanding, call it which you please, fluctuates betwixt the opposite views; and tho' perhaps it may be oftener turned to one side than the other, it is impossible for it, by reason of the opposition of causes or chances, to rest on either. The pro and con of the question alternately prevail; and the mind, surveying the objects in their opposite causes, finds such a contrariety as utterly destroys all certainty or established opinion.","subId":"8","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Suppose, then, that the object, concerning which we are doubtful, produces either desire or aversion; it is evident, that, according as the mind turns itself to one side or the other, it must feel a momentary impression of joy or sorrow. An object, whose existence we desire, gives satisfaction, when we think of those causes, which produce it; and for the same reason, excites grief or uneasiness, from the opposite consideration. So that, as the understanding, in probable questions, is divided betwixt the contrary points of view, the heart must in the same manner be divided betwixt opposite emotions.","subId":"9","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now, if we consider the human mind, we shall observe, that, with regard to the passions, it is not like a wind-instrument of music, which, in running over all the notes, immediately loses the sound when the breath ceases; but rather resembles a string-instrument, where, after each stroke, the vibrations still retain some sound, which gradually and insensibly decays. The imagination is extremely quick and agile; but the passions, in comparison, are slow and restive: For which reason, when any object is presented, which affords a variety of views to the one and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion, but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other. According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the passion of grief or joy predominates in the composition; and these passions, being intermingled by means of the contrary views of the imagination, produce by the union the passions of hope or fear.","subId":"10","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.10"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As this theory seems to carry its own evidence along with it, we shall be more concise in our proofs.","subId":"11","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.11","subsection":"4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The passions of fear and hope may arise, when the chances are equal on both sides, and no superiority can be discovered in one above the other. Nay, in this situation the passions are rather the strongest, as the mind has then the least foundation to rest upon, and is tost with the greatest uncertainty. Throw in a superior degree of probability to the side of grief, you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over the composition, and tincture it into fear. Encrease the probability, and by that means the grief; the fear prevails still more and more, till at last it runs insensibly, as the joy continually diminishes, into pure grief. After you have brought it to this situation, diminish the grief, by a contrary operation to that, which encreased it, to wit, by diminishing the probability on the melancholy side; and you will see the passion clear every moment, till it changes insensibly into hope; which again runs, by slow degrees, into joy, as you encrease that part of the composition, by the encrease of the probability. Are not these as plain proofs, that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray of the sun, passing thro' a prism, is a composition of two others, when, as you diminish or encrease the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably, more or less, in the composition?","subId":"12","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.12"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Probability is of two kinds; either when the object is itself uncertain, and to be determined by chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain, yet is it uncertain to our judgment, which finds a number of proofs or presumptions on each side of the question. Both these kinds of probability cause fear and hope; which must proceed from that property, in which they agree; to wit, the uncertainty and fluctuation which they bestow on the passion, by that contrariety of views, which is common to both.","subId":"13","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.13","subsection":"5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is a probable good or evil, which commonly causes hope or fear; because probability, producing an inconstant and wavering survey of an object, occasions naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of passion. But we may observe, that, wherever, from other causes, this mixture can be produced, the passions of fear and hope will arise, even tho' there be no probability.","subId":"14","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.14","subsection":"6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"An evil, conceived as barely possible, sometimes produces fear; especially if the evil be very great. A man cannot think of excessive pain and torture without trembling, if he runs the least risque of suffering them. The smallness of the probability is compensated by the greatness of the evil.","subId":"15","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But even impossible evils cause fear; as when we tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know ourselves to be in perfect security, and have it in our choice, whether we will advance a step farther. The immediate presence of the evil influences the imagination and produces a species of belief; but being opposed by the reflection on our security, that belief is immediately retracted, and causes the same kind of passion, as when, from a contrariety of chances, contrary passions are produced.","subId":"16","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Evils, which are certain, have sometimes the same effect as the possible or impossible. A man, in a strong prison, without the least means of escape, trembles at the thoughts of the rack, to which he is sentenced. The evil is here fixed in itself; but the mind has not courage to fix upon it; and this fluctuation gives rise to a passion of a similar appearance with fear.","subId":"17","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"But it is not only where good or evil is uncertain as to its existence, but also as to its kind, that fear or hope arises. If any one were told, that one of his sons is suddenly killed; the passion, occasioned by this event, would not settle into grief, till he got certain information, which of his sons he had lost. Tho' each side of the question produces here the same passion; that passion cannot settle, but receives from the imagination, which is unfixt, a tremulous, unsteddy motion, resembling the mixture and contention of grief and joy.","subId":"18","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.18","subsection":"7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus all kinds of uncertainty have a strong connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cause any opposition of passions, by the opposite views, which they present to us. Should I leave a friend in any malady, I should feel more anxiety upon his account, than if he were present; tho' perhaps I am not only incapable of giving him assistance, but likewise of judging concerning the event of his sickness. There are a thousand little circumstances of his situation and condition, which I desire to know; and the knowledge of them would prevent that fluctuation and uncertainty, so nearly allied to fear. Horace has remarked this phænomenon: \n\nUt assidens implumibus pullus avis \n   Serpentûm allapsus timet, \n Magis relictis; non, ut adsit, auxili \n   Latura plus præsentibus.\n\n","subId":"19","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.19","subsection":"8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A virgin on her bridal-night goes to bed full of fears and apprehensions, tho' she expects nothing but pleasure. The confusion of wishes and joys, the newness and greatness of the unknown event, so embarrass the mind, that it knows not in what image or passion to fix itself.","subId":"20","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.20"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Concerning the mixture of affections, we may remark, in general, that when contrary passions arise from objects no way connected together, they take place alternately. Thus when a man is afflicted for the loss of a law-suit, and joyful for the birth of a son, the mind, running from the agreeable to the calamitous object; with whatever celerity it may perform this motion, can scarcely temper the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a state of indifference.","subId":"21","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.21","subsection":"9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It more easily attains that calm situation, when the same event is of a mixt nature, and contains something adverse and something prosperous in its different circumstances.

In contrary passions, if the objects be totally different, the passions are like two opposite liquors in different bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be intimately connected, the passions are like an alcali or an acid, which, being mingled, destroy each other. If the relation be more imperfect, and consists in the contradictory views of the same object, the passions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and incorporate.","subId":"24","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.24"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The effect of a mixture of passions, when one of them is predominant and swallows up the other, shall be explained afterwards.","subId":"25","id":"Hume.ETSS.DP.1757.1.25"}]}
