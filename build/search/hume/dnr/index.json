Because of the sensitive nature of the text, however, he did not publish it in his lifetime, but left instructions to his nephew to publish it after his death. It was printed in 1779, and this edition is naturally our copytext. Fortunately, however, Hume’s own manuscript for the work survives. This manuscript was consulted in drawing up the critical text provided here.","blocks":[{"type":"title","content":"DIALOGUES\nCONCERNING\nNATURAL RELIGION.\n","id":"Hume.DNR"}],"texts":[{"id":"Hume.DNR.Intro","imported":true,"title":"Pamphilus to Hermippus","breadcrumb":"Pamphilus to Hermippus","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.1","imported":true,"title":"Part 1","breadcrumb":"Part 1","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.2","imported":true,"title":"Part 2","breadcrumb":"Part 2","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.3","imported":true,"title":"Part 3","breadcrumb":"Part 3","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.4","imported":true,"title":"Part 4","breadcrumb":"Part 4","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.5","imported":true,"title":"Part 5","breadcrumb":"Part 5","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.6","imported":true,"title":"Part 6","breadcrumb":"Part 6","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.7","imported":true,"title":"Part 7","breadcrumb":"Part 7","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.8","imported":true,"title":"Part 8","breadcrumb":"Part 8","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.9","imported":true,"title":"Part 9","breadcrumb":"Part 9","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.10","imported":true,"title":"Part 10","breadcrumb":"Part 10","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.11","imported":true,"title":"Part 11","breadcrumb":"Part 11","published":[1779]},{"id":"Hume.DNR.12","imported":true,"title":"Part 12","breadcrumb":"Part 12","published":[1779]}],"ancestors":[{"id":"Hume","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":1739,"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","texts":[{"id":"Hume.THN","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Treatise of Human Nature","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1739,1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Treatise"},{"id":"Hume.A","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"An Abstract of a Book Lately Published","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1740],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Abstract"},{"id":"Hume.EWU","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1741,1742,1756],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays, Withdrawn and Unpublished"},{"id":"Hume.LG","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1745],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Letter from a Gentleman"},{"id":"Hume.ETSS","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1758],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Essays and Treatises"},{"id":"Hume.HE","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"The History of England","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1754,1757,1759,1762],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"History of England"},{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"My Own Life"},{"id":"Hume.DNR","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1779],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"Dialogues"}]}],"prev":{"id":"Hume.MOL","forename":"David","surname":"Hume","title":"My Own Life","birth":1711,"death":1776,"published":[1777],"nationality":"Scottish","sex":"Male","imported":true,"breadcrumb":"My Own Life"}}
