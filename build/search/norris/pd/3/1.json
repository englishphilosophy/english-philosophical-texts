For need any Power or Faculty be under any other Law, than that of its own Nature, to delight in its proper Object? Does the Sense want a Precept to be pleased with sensible Good? Need we address our selves to the Eye to persuade it to love Light, or take pains to exhort the Ear to delight in harmonious Sounds? No, the Order of Nature does here supersede all other Methods of Engagement, and why then should there be need of any Command to a Rational Soul to love God? Does not an intelligible Good bear the same proportion to a reasonable Nature, as a sensible Good does to Sense; and is not God the same to the Soul, as Musick is to the Ear, or as Light to the Eye? Yes certainly, and infinitely more: For these things, tho they are the proper Goods of their respective Powers, yet they are not wholly commensurate, and fully adjusted to their Capacities; whence it is that they Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with hearing. But now God is not only the proper Good of the Soul (as Light is of the Eye) but is withal a Good so transcendently excellent as to be able to fill the whole Capacity of its intellectual Powers. The Good of his sublime Nature is more than commensurate to the most stretch'd Appetite of ours; nay, were our Capacity infinite, he would be sufficient to fill it; for he fills his own, and is infinitely happy in himself.

And accordingly the Love of God being the fundamental Principle of all natural Religion and Virtue, or (as our Lord here terms it) the first and great Commandment, upon which all the Duties of the first Table do immediately, and those of the second remotely depend, it was very requisite that there should be an express Precept concerning it, tho it be never so evident that we ought to love God, and withal never so necessary and unavoidable that we should.","subId":"2","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.2"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Besides, 'tis also secondly to be consider'd, that what does here more principally and more directly fall under the Precept, is not the Act of loving God in general, but the special degree and manner of that Act, that it be with the whole Power and full Capacity of the Man.

This is not a Proposition of so bright an evidence as to shine forth by its own Light, but requires a Train of Argument and Consequence to make it appear reasonable, and must be proved in a way of Science and Demonstration. It was indeed below the Dignity and Majesty of the Supreme Law-giver to do that, but therefore it was the more necessary for him to use his Authority, to make it matter of express Precept, and to lay it as an eternal Law upon every rational Spirit that comes into being, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.","subId":"3","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.3"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The great Difficulty of this great Commandment, next to the Practising of it, is how to Understand it; and therefore I shall first of all inquire into the true Sense and Import of it, and then into the Reason and Bottom upon which it stands.","subId":"4","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.4"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"As to the Sense, I think the highest that is generally put upon these Words amounts to no more than this, That God is to be the prime and principal Object of our Love and Delight; That we are to love him in a Superlative way, above all other things whatsoever, so as to lose any Good, or suffer any Evil rather than commit the least Sin against him; That we are always to prefer him in our Love, chusing to obey him rather than Man, and to please him rather than satisfie our own Will, and to enjoy him rather than any worldly or carnal Pleasure, saying with the Psalmist, Thy Loving-kindness is better than Life, and with the Church in the Canticles, Thy Love is better than Wine.","subId":"5","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.5"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And if our Love be thus order'd, if we stand thus affected towards God, we are then allowed according to the common Opinion to Love Creatures, to delight and solace our selves in them, to unite our Souls in some measure to them, and to reckon them among the props and stays of our life, and as the Ingredients of its present Happiness. Nor is there any harm presumed in all this, still provided that God be uppermost in our Hearts, have the largest share in our Affections, and be seated upon the Throne of the Soul, who though permitted to love other things, is yet to look upon God as her greatest Good, and accordingly to reserve her brightest and purest flame for his Altar; to love him with the choice, with the flower of her Affection, and be ready to part with any other good when it once comes in competition with the Love of God.","subId":"6","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.6"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"In this I think I speak the sense of the common Interpreters, who for want of a suitable Foundation could not well carry the Building higher, but were forced to take up with an Explication far below the express Letter of the Text, and to make this to be all that was signified by loving God with all the heart, with all the soul, and with all the mind, that we love him chiefly and principally, best and most. Sure they could not but be sensible that herein they did not rise up to the Letter of the Text, which manifestly requires a more elevated sense: But they could not advance higher without building in the Air; and were therefore forced to cramp the sense of this great Commandment, and to put such a Construction upon it, not as the express Words of it require, but as their Hypothesis would bear.","subId":"7","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.7"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I say as their Hypothesis would bear; for the Hypothesis these Men go upon, seems to be this; They suppose that other things besides God are truly and properly the Goods of the Soul, and contribute as efficient Causes to its happiness: That sensible Objects contain in themselves somewhat answerable to what we feel by their Occasion, and are withal the proper Causes of such our Sensations: That the Bodies that surround us do really act in and upon us, not only by making impression upon our Bodies, and striking upon our Organs of Sense, but also by raising and exciting those Sensations our Spirits are conscious of, so as to be the true efficient Causes of our Pleasure and our Pain: That the Fire gives us that sentiment of Heat which we feel when we approach it: and, That Wine causes in us that pleasing Taste which we feel when we drink it: And the like.","subId":"8","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.8"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Now I confess, if this Hypothesis be true, if sensible Objects do really act upon our Souls, and are the proper efficient Causes of those pleasing Sensations which we feel there, then 'twill necessarily follow, that a certain portion of my Love is due to these sensible Objects: for, if these Objects produce Pleasure in me, then they do me good, they perfect my Being, and render it more happy; and if they do me good, then in their proportion they are my good; and if they are in any degree my good, then they are so far lovely; and if they are in any way lovely, then so far they ought to be loved. But now, if some part of our Love be due to sensible Objects (as upon this Hypothesis it is) then 'tis impossible that God should have a right to all of it; and consequently, to love him with all the heart, and all the soul, and all the mind, can signifie no more than to love him principally and above all, to give him the Preference in our Love. I say the Preference, for it seems the Creatures put in for a share; and if they have a part, 'tis impossible that God should have the whole: they must then both go sharers in our Affection, and the only Privilege which God can claim upon this Hypothesis, is, to have the largest share in our Love.","subId":"9","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.9"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Whether this Hypothesis be true of no, shall be consider'd in its proper place; in the mean while if may serve as a strong Presumption, that it is not, that the Explication which is founded upon it falls so very short of the literal Emphasis of the Text, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all the soul, and with all thy mind. But is it to love God at this rate, to love him only principally and more than any thing else? Does this exhaust the sense of this great Commandment? Can he be said with any tolerable sense to love God with all his heart, all his soul, and all his mind, that only love him above other things, at the same time allowing other things a share in his Love? Can he be said to love God with all his Love that loves him only with a Part? What though that PArt be the larger Part, 'tis but a Part still; and is a Part the Whole?

In one Word, that God be not only the principal, but the only Oject of our Love. This indeed is a Sacrifice worthy of a God, when the Whole Man is offer'd up to him as a Burnt Offering: And no less can he be supposed to require from us by vertue of this great Law, when he bids us to love him with all our Heart, with all our Soul, and with all our Mind. In the same Sense therefore as 'tis said, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve; so is this great Commandment to be understood, as if it were said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou desire.

That he is also the only proper Object of it.","subId":"13","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.13"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"First, I consider that God is the only Author or Cause of our Love. By Love here I understand that original Weight, Bent or Endeavour whereby the Soul of Man stands inclined and is moved forwards to Good in general or Happiness. Now that this Impression is from God, and that 'tis he alone that has put this Biass into our Natures, I think demonstrable several ways; but at present shall only consider that this Motion of the Soul is a necessary Adherent to our Beings, such as we were never without, and such as we can never put off; such as is all over invincible and irresistable. The Soul of Man must not pretend to the least degree of Liberty here (for indeed it being impossible that our Love to Good in general should be bad, it was not fit it should be free) but is altogether passive in this Motion, and moves no otherwise than as she is moved. She has no more Command over this Motion than she has over the Motion of the Heart or Pulse, which shews it to be equally Vital and Natural, and of the very essential Make and Constitution of our Being. Well then, I demand, Is this natural necessary Motion from our Selves or from God? If from our Selves, How comes it then to pass, that we cannot command it, or stop it? Had we Power to produce what we have not Power to govern? or, is it more difficult to govern than to produce? No certainly, were we the Authors of this Motion we should have some Power over it, and be able to manage and controul it; which since we cannot do, we may well conclude, that 'tis not a thing of our Production; and that though it be in us, yet 'tis not of or from our Selves. And whence then must it be but from God? Who else could kindle in our Natures such an unquenchable Flame? Who else could fix such a strong Spring in our Souls, and actuate our Beings with such a mighty Energy? And who should be the Author of what is Natural and Necessary in us, but he that is the Author of our Natures? Love is the same in the Moral and intellectual World as Motion is in the Natural; and as we make God to be the Author of Natural Motion, so there is as much reason to make him the Author of our Love. But now if God be the only Author and Cause of our Love, has not he then the sole Right and Title to it? and has not he also a Right to it all? This may seem perhaps at first glance to be a captious and surprizing way of Arguing; but consider it well; Has not God a Right to all that he produces? What is it that gives him a Right to the whole World, but his Production of it? Why has God a Right to me, but because I am his Creature? Upon what Account has he a Right to all my Powers and Faculties, and to all the service of them, but because he produces them, and sustains them; because in him we Live, Move, and have our being? But now if God does as much produce my Love as he does my Being, then, Why has he not as much Right to my Love as to any other part of my Nature? And if God only has a Right to it all, as having produced it all, then 'tis evident, that all of it ought to be fix'd upon him, and that he has great Injury and Injustice done him whenever any the least degree of it goes besides him. Indeed were there any part or degree of our Love which God did not produce, That we might give away from him, That we might bestow upon a Creature; but if God be the Author of it all, if there be not one degree of our Love but what he produces, 'tis highly just and reasonable that he should have it all; and we cannot let the least Spark of this sacred Fire light upon the Creature without so far defrauding the Creator.","subId":"14","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.14"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Especially if we consider further the Manner how, and the End for which God produces our Love. I now suppose, as a thing already proved, that all the Motion that the Soul has towards Good comes from God; but how does God move us towards Good? Whither is it that God does then direct this Motion? He himself indeed is the Author of it, but what is the Term of it? to what does God move us? Our corrupt Imagination may perhaps be ready here to suggest that God moves us to Good by moving us towards the Creature. But stay, Would such a Term of this Motion be worthy of its Cause? Can God move us towards the Creature? Can he move us from himself? Can he act for a Creature? Can he make the Creature his End? Does not God make all things for himself? Does he not always act for himself? Is he not always his own End? Has not this the Evidence of a First Principle, That God acts only for himself? We must therefore of necessity conclude, That as God is the Author of this Motion, so he is the Natural End and Term of it too; and that he moves us to Good no otherwise, than by moving us towards himself. We must conclude, that God is the true great Magnet of our Souls; that he continually draws and moves them, not from, but to himself, as being both their, and his own great End. We must conclude, that God intended himself as the sole Object of the Love which he produced; that he has imprest a Motion upon our Intellectual Heart, only to incline it toward himself; and that as the whole Motion of our Love is from God, so it has no other Term than God in the Order and Institution of Nature.","subId":"15","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.15"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Well then, if the Case be thus, if God moves us to Good by moving us towards himself: Is it not then a transgressing this Order and Institution of Nature?

Do we not then Cross the Order of Nature, and resist the Will of its great Author? Do we not then hinder his Act, and put a Bar to his Motion within us? Nay, do we not then act against the Constitution of our own Frame, and run Counter to the great Bias of our Natures? What, does he that gave us our Beings, shew also so great a Concern for their Perfection, as to impress upon them a continual Motion towards himself; and shall we be so ungrateful as well as unjust, as to stop short, and take up with a Creature? We ought certainly to follow the Order, and conform to the Will of God; and since he has order'd the Motion of our Love to no less Noble an End than himself, 'tis evident that thither only we ought to direct, and there only to fix our Love.","subId":"16","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.16"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And that we do not at all strain the Sense of this Commandment, by supposing it thus to oblige us to Love the Lord our God with all the Heart, Soul and Mind, in the strictest Emphasis of the Phrase, will yet further appear, if we examin the other general gound upon which it stands, and consider","subId":"17","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.17"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Secondly, That as God is the only Author and Cause of our Love, so is he also the only proper Object of it.

And yet she has had the ill Fortune to be least of all consulted in this matter. It is generally thought, that the Pleasure we feel in the Use, and by the Intervention of Bodies is caused in us by the Bodies themselves. That the Fire for instance, produces in us the Sensation of Warmth, that the Sun produces in us the Sensation of Light, that the Fruits of the Earth Communicate to us the Sensations of the plesant Tastes, and the like. These Bodies are first supposed to have something like these Sensations in themselves, and the to produce them in us. Thus Fire is supposed to be endued with the quality of Heat in itself, and then to impart this quality to us; to be first Hot in its own Nature, and then to make us so. This has been all along the Current unquestion'd Apprehension, not only of the Vulgar who think in haste, and determin of things only as they appear to Sense, but of the more inquisitive and reasoning part of Mankind. And though some of the Modern Reformers of Philosophy have thought fit to reject the former part of the Supposition, viz. That Bodies have in themselves something answerable to the Sensations which we feel in the use of them; yet they generally retain the Later, viz. That they produce and cause those Sensations in us, and do accordingly allow, that Fire (for instance) is Eminently and Potentially, though not Formally hot, that is, That though it has not any thing resembling the Sensation of Heat in it self, yet it has a Power to produce such a Sensation in those that shall approach it. This they not only allow, but contend for. For whereas according to the Old Distinction, some things were said to be both Formally and Eminently hot too (as Fire) and some only eminently, (as the Sun) the Moderns have ventured to cut off the former part of the Distinction, and reduce all to the later, by supposing all Bodies that we call Hot, to be so only Eminently and Potentially, as they are productive of Heat in us. And by this they explain the Phenomenon of Heat in Bodies, supposing it to be nothing else in the Bodies themselves, but only a Power of producing such a Sensation. But then by this they manifestly hold that they do produce it; and I know but of One amongst them that thinks any Otherwise, or any Farther. They thought, it seems, they had sufficiently reform'd the Vulgar Philosophy, by shaking off the former part of their Hypothesis, That Bodies have in themselves some inherent Quality analogous to our Sensations; so much they saw must be rejected. But they could not tell how to deny the later part, and do therefore hold, that Bodies do produce in us such and such Sensations, though they have nothing of a Similar Nature with them in themselves.","subId":"19","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.19"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Very good. But were they determin'd to this Persuasion by the Moments of Reason? I think 'tis to be doubted whether they ever so much as Consulted her in this part of the Question.

This is the only reason that is, or can be pretended in behalf of this Common Presumption. But is this a Warrantable Conclusion? Does it follow, that because such Sensations do accompany such Bodily Impressions, that therefore those Bodily Impressions are the Cause of those Sensations? Can we argue from the Concomitancy of one thing with another, to the Causal Dependence of the one thing upon another?

Nay, they would have seen, that the very same Reasons that induced them to the one, ought also to have determin'd them to the other. For why is it that they will not allow that Bodies have in them something like our Sensations, particularly that in Fire there is any such thing as a Quality of Heat, answerable to what we call Heat in our selves: I say, why is it that they will not allow this, but because they reason'd with themselves to this effect: There is nothing conceivable in Bodies but Magnitude, Figure, and Motion? For instance, there is nothing in Fire but certain Particles of Matter so and so sized, so and so figured, and so and so moved. Examin your Idea of Fire a thousand time over, and this is all you will ever be able to find in it. I say find in it: For 'tis true indeed, when you come near you find something more from it, you find withall a Sensation of Heat, either pleasing or painful according as your distance is. But you have no more reason thence to conclude, that there is such a Quality as Heat, resembling  what you feel, in the Fire, than you have to conclude Pain to be in a Needle or a Thorn. When you approach the Fire you feel Heat, and when you prick your Hand with a Needle you feel Pain; but as you do not therefore fancy any such thing as Pain to be in the Needle, so neither ought you to suppose any such thing as Heat to be in the Fire. That indeed which makes Men more apt to do so in this Case than in the other is, because the Particles of the Fire are too Minute to be discern'd by the Eye, and so Men not perceiving the Mechanicalness of its Operation, are apt to have recourse to some inherent Quality; whereas the Thorn and Needle are of a Visible Bulk, and we see how they pierce and wound our Flesh. But did Men as clearly see the Particles of the Fire, with their Size, Figure and Motion, and with what a Spring they are shot and darted forth upon us, and how like so many fine Needles or Launces they enter and divide the parts of our Body, they would no more Dream of any such thing as Heat in the Fire, than they do of Pain in a Needle, and would think it every whit as odd and improper to say, Fire is Hot, as to say a Needle is Painful. And though as the Case now stands, they are apt to fancy the contrary; yet 'tis plain, that this is only an illusion of Sense, Reason in the mean while constantly assuring us, that there can be nothing in Fire but Particles of Matter of such a Size and Shape, and in such a degree of Motion: And withall, that we cannot ascribe such a thing as Heat to the Fire, answerable to that Sensation in our selves, without ascribing to it also Thought and Perception at the same time, which would be of intolerable Consequence.","subId":"22","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.22"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Upon these, and such like Considerations, the Reformers of Philosophy, I presume, thought it necessary to reject the former part of the Vulgar Hypothesis, that Bodies have in them some certain Qualities answerable to our Sensations. And no doubt but that they reason'd upon clear and distinct Idea's. But will not the very same Considerations be of equal force to disprove the later part too, that Bodies do cause and produce Sensations in us? For if there be nothing in Bodies but Motion and Figure, if they are capable of no other Modification, then whatever they do, they must do it by the Motion, and by the Figure of their Parts; there being nothing besides supposed to be in them. If therefore they cause our Sensations, 'tis by their Figure and their Motion that they must do it. But can Motion of Figure produce a Sensation, a Sentiment of the Mind, a Thought? 'Tis hard, extreme hard, to conceive how one Motion should beget another. But can it produce an Effect more Noble and Excellent, and of an Order so very much higher than it self? Can it produce a Thought? Is there any Proportion between such a Cause and such an Effect; between Motion and Thinking, between an Affection of a Body, and a Sentiment of the Soul? Or is there any proportion between such a particular Motion, and such a particular Sensation; between that Motion, suppose, that is follow'd with Pleasure, and Pleasure; or between that Motion which is follow'd with Pain, and Pain? Is that Motion which de facto is accompanied with Pleasure, more apt of its self and in its own Nature, to produce that Sensation rather than Pain? Or may not that very Motion which is de facto follow'd with Pleasure, be as well the Occasion of Pain for any Proportion, Affinity, or Natural Connexion that is in the things themselves? 'Tis most certain that it may. For Pleasure and Pain are Sensations of so wholly different, nay contrary a kind. They differ as much as any two things can do. They differ not only Essentially, but as Contraries, as extreme Opposites. And they do almost make their Subjects do so, the Soul that is in Pleasure differing almost Specifically from her self when she is in Pain. But now there is not the like difference between the respective Motions supposed to produce them; They differ only Accidentally and Gradually. That Motion of the Fire which occasions Pleasure, differs only in Degree from that which occasions Pain. Whence it is evident, that these Causes are not in themselves equivalent to their Effects, nor have any Natural Relation to them, but are indifferent to either, as being disproportionate to both. That the same Motion that is now attended with Pleasure, might as well (for any particularity in the thing it self) be attended with Pain, there being as great disproportion between these particular Motions and their particular Sensations, as between Motion and Sensation in general.","subId":"23","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.23"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"What is here said of Motion, is as applicable to Figure; and since these are the only two Modifications Body is capable of, and these hold no proportion with our Sensations, 'tis plain that our Sensations ought not, cannot be ascribed to Bodies as their proper Efficient Causes.

Does not the same Want and Incapacity of Thought infer the one as well as the other? Bodies have no Thought, therefore they have no Sensations; Bodies have no Thought, therefore they produce none: Is not the last Consequence as good as the first? Without all question it is.

The less the resistance is, the less always is the Impression (as appears from that little force the strongest Wind has upon a Body of a Conical Figure) and consequently where there is no resistance at all, there can be no Impression at all. And therefore since Spirits make no resistance against Bodies, it is not possible that Bodies should have any Action, or make and Impression upon Spirits. The most that can be allow'd to Bodies, is to be able to act upon other Bodies, either by moving all their parts at once out of their place, or by changing the Order and Situation of the Parts among themselves; but how they should be capable of acting upon Spirits, upon a sort of Beings that make no resistance against them, is what I can neither Conceive, or think Conceivable.","subId":"29","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.29"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Suppose I should fling a Stone at a Spirit, should I hurt it, do you think?

Upon my Approach I find my troublesom Sensation of Cold to abate and by degrees to be exhanged for a more grateful one, which we call Heat. This is the Effect that I experience upon my coming near the Fire. But pray what does the Fire do to me? Why to speak properly it does nothing to me, that is, to my Spirit. But what is it that it does to my Body? Why it variously moves and agitates the Parts of it, and if near enough will divide and separate one Part from another, and so dissolve my Bodily Frame.

No, that's your mistake, I do not feel the Impression made upon my Body (for how can I feel what is done to another thing?) but I feel a certain Sensation in my Soul either of Pleasure or Pain, between which and that Bodily Impression there is no manner of Similitude or Proportion. The Sensation is that which I feel. But that is not what the Fire does, whose whole Efficiency being only Motion and Figure can have Effect no further than upon my Body. But the Sensation which I feel is not in my Body, but in my Soul, and consequently is not of the Fire's producing, but must be ascribed to some other Cause.

There is they say a very close Tie and Union between the Soul and Body, and by this means Fire comes to operate upon the Soul, and to give it Pleasure or Pain, and all by Vertue of this Union.

And can any Two things that are really distinct one from the other, be so united or connected together in their own natures, that an impression made upon the one, shall by the same act affect the other? Is there any such natural connexion between Body and Body, or Spirit and Spirit? Much less then between Body and Spirit. Do the Figures which are cut upon the Bark of a Tree wound my Body?

I may indeed make it my own in a moral sense, by interessing my self in it, but then 'tis not another's Pain that I indure (unless figuratively speaking) but my own. There is no natural sympathy between my Spirit and any other Spirit in the World, nor am I concerned in any change that is wrought in it, whether for Happiness or Misery, and further than I please to concern my self.

That Bodies and Spirits (or indeed any two Substances) are or can be so united, that one should feel the Impression made upon the other. But besides, that which I feel is not the Impression made upon my Body (as was observ'd before) but a Sensation, whether of Pleasure or Pain; between which and the Impression, there is not the least shadow or likeness or proportion. 'Tis common indeed to say, we feel such a Blow, or we feel such a Wound, but this must not be allow'd but in a popular Latitude; for to speak strictly and Philosophically, 'tis not the Blow that we feel, but Pain; which being a Sensation of the Soul, is distinct from the Impression made upon the Body; and consequently the Soul cannot be said to fell what is done to the Body, (for it feels something else:) Nor can what is done to the Body, be the Cause of what the Soul feels.","subId":"35","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.35"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"By this it sufficiently appears, that the Fire cannot be truly said to operate upon the Soul by the Mediation of the Body in either of the two former ways: If then they will have the Fire to operate upon the Soul by virtue of its Union with the Body, they must be supposed to intend it in the third and last sense of the expression; namely, that there is such a positive Law or Order establish'd between them by the Author of Nature, that such Impressions made upon the Body, shall be follow'd by such Sensations in the Soul: Now I acknowledg, that this is a right Notion of the Union that is between Soul and Body, as resolving it not into a Natural, but a Positive Connexion and Dependance, it being impossible that two really distinct Substances, such as Body and Soul are, should be united together any otherwise. But then I deny that the Fire can be truly said to act upon the Soul by virtue of such an Union as this. And to say that it does, is in effect to give up the Cause, by granting the very thing hitherto contended for. To say that the Fire thus acts upon the Soul is implicitly to confess, that it does not truly act upon it at all, and to lead us directly to the proper Cause that does. For when you say that the Fire causes such a Sensation in the Soul by reason of that Law, that such Sensations shall follow such Impressions, (for this is what you are now supposed to understand by the Union of Soul and Body) 'tis plain that you ascribe the effect, not to the Fire, but to that Law, whatever it be. For if such a Sensation did naturally and directly follow such an Impression of the Fire as an Effect follows its proper Cause, then what need of any Law or Order to be establish'd, that such a Sensation should follow such an Impression? 'Tis plain therefore, that the Sensation produced in the Soul at the Impression of the Fire, is to be resolved into this Law as its proper Cause, and can depend upon the Impression no otherwise, than as an Occasion, or a Condition determining the Efficiency of this Law.

The sum is, there are three things of distinct Consideration relating to the Fire, the Motion that is in the Fire it self, the Impression made upon my Body by that Motion, and the Sensation that follows in the Soul upon that Impression. As to the Motion that is in the Fire it self, therein consists its proper Power, Force and Activity: As to the Impression made upon my Body, that is the effect which it works by that Power; but as to the Sensation which follows in my Soul upon that Impression, this does no way depend upon the Impression of the Fire as its Efficient Cause, but is raised or produced in me by the Author of my Nature, by the occasion of that Impression, according to that general Law and Order he has establish'd, that such certain Sensations should follow upon such certain Impressions, as in the sequel I shall more directly shew.","subId":"38","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.38"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"I have hitherto shewn, both by General and by Particular Considerations, that Bodies are not the true proper Causes of our Sensations, of that Pleasure and that Pain, which by their intervention we feel, and which therefore they seem, and are generally thought to produce.

And this hinders them from inquiring any further, or any higher. But now were this Prejudice of Sense once removed, could Men once get over this Difficulty that their Sensations are not caused by Bodies, there would not be much Difficulty to persuade them that they are caused by God.

For if my own Spirit were the Cause of those Sensations which I feel at the Impressions which other Bodies make upon mine, it would then be in my Power to have those Sensations as well without the Impressions of Bodies as with them. I might then have the Sensation of Light without the Impression of the Sun, and the Sensation of Heat without Fire, and the Sensation of sweet Odours and Tasts without the Mediation of odorifick or sapid Bodies. For since these Bodies are supposed according to the Principles before laid down not to have any Concurrence by way of Efficiency in the Production of those Sensations, but only to serve as positive Conditions to determin the Action of that Cause (whatever it is) which does produce them, certainly it must be in the Power of that Cause to produce those Sensations without any such bodily Impressions, nay, though there were no such thing as Body in being. As he that made the Waters of Marah sweet by throwing in of a Tree, might if he had so pleas'd, as well have made them sweet without it. And consequently were I my self that Cause, what should hinder me from raising the Sensations I now feel as well without as with those Impressions to which they are ordinarily annexed?

Besides that exact and thoroughly comprehensive Knowledg that such a Being must have of our Natures, of our whole Animal and Intellectual Frame, and that Effectual Power he must also have to work upon them, which we can hardly ascribe to any other Being than him that made us, who seems only fitted both to understand and order his own Workmanship, I say besides this, he must also be supposed to know the very critical Moment when such and such Bodies make Impression upon ours, and he must also know critically the Degree of that Impression, and he must also know exactly the very instant when the Impression ceases. He must know the Moment of the Impression, that he may know when to produce the Sensation. He must know the Degree of the Impression, that he may know how to proportion the Sensation.

As for example, that Being whoever he is that produces in me the Sensation of Heat as often as I draw near the Fire, must be supposed to know exactly when I do so, that he may know how to time that Sensation, and he must know the critical Degree of the Fire's Impression that he may know how to temper and proportion that Sensation, that he may not burn me when by the Impression he should only warm me, and he must also know the very Instant when I go from the Fire, that he may know when to remove the Sensation by ceasing to act upon my Soul.

We are to trace out with diligence all the private ways of this wandring Passion, fetch in every stragling Affection, and not suffer the least weight of our Love to rest upon a Creature. No, we are to summon every Creature to come in and give up that Portion of our Love which it has so long usurp'd, but could never deserve; and when once our Heart is free of them, we are wholly to devote it to God, whom we are to make the Sole Proprietor of our Love, which we are no longer to look upon as Common, but as Sacred Fire, which must be wholly appropriated to the Altar.","subId":"50","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.50"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"And that we ought to be thus rooted and grounded in Divine Love; and that there is such a Breadth, Length, Depth and Height in it, that we have not either laid our Foundation too deep, or raised our Structure too hight, will appear by many places of Scripture (besides that in the Text) injoyning our Love to God according to the same amplitude and unmeasurable Measure. Such are all those Divine Testimonies as import a not loving or hating of God, when any portion of our Love is bestow'd upon the Creature. To which purpose is that Speech of our Saviour, who was the best Teacher, and the best Patern of Divine Love, No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Here we are plainly told, that we cannot divide between God and the Creature; but that the adhering to the one is the rejecting of the other. And the reason is, not only because our Natural Faculties and Capacities are too Narrow and Scanty to be employ'd upon two such vastly different Objects; but also because we cannot love either of them but upon such a Principle as must utterly exclude the love of the other. For we must not love any thing but what is our true Good, what can both deserve and reward our Love. And there can be but one thing that is so. It must either be God or the Creature. If then the Creature be our Good, let us love that and that only, that and not God; but if God be our true Good (as most certainly he is) then let us love God and God only, God and not the Creature.

What can be more full and plain, Love not the World, nor the things of the World? I know that according to the Common Gloss this is meant of the immoderate Love of the World, as if St. John had said, Love not the World immoderately or to excess. But this is only for want of Principles upon which to raise an higher Sense.

Whosoever therefore will be a Friend of the World is the Enemy of God. It seems that in St. James's Account our Heart is so much God's Property and Peculiar, and ought to intirely to be devoted to him that 'tis a kind of Spiritual Adultery to admit any Creature into a Partnership with him in our Love. I know but of one sort of Spiritual Sin besides that is call'd Adultery in Scripture, and that is the Sin of Idolatry, which goes frequently by the Name of going a Whoring after other Gods. And so in like manner the Love of the Creature is here said to be Adultery, which implies that they are in great measure the same, as having one common Name, and that every Lover of the Creature is in his proportion an Idolater. And so upon our former Principle he is. For by loving Creatures we suppose them our Goods, that they are able to act upon our Souls and affect them with pleasing Sensations, that they perfect our Being and are the Causes of our Happiness, which is to suppose them to be as so many Gods.

The Apostle here first of all supposes the World to be crucified, that is, to be a dead, unactive, silent and quiescent thing in respect of himself, as not being able to operate upon him, or affect his Soul with any Sentiment as a true, proper Efficient Cause, and then in Consequence of that declares himself to be also crucified to the World, not only indifferently or moderately affected towards it, but perfectly dead and cold to all its Imbraces, and altogether insensible and unmoved at all its Charms. For to what purpose should a Man hug and imbrace a Carcase, or be alive to that which is dead to him? Let me imbrace the World never so long I shall never be able to impart a vital Heat to it, to quicken it into Life and Motion; but that perhaps may communicate some of its Coldness to me, chill and benum my Faculties.

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, all thy Soul, and all thy Mind. My Son, give me thy Heart, we may now suppose to be the Language of the Great God to every Rational Creature. Give me thy Heart, for 'twas I that made it, 'twas I that gave it thee, 'twas I that kindled in it a vital Flame, 'twas I that gave it its Pulse and its Motion, and that for no other end but to direct and incline it toward me, the only proper Object of its tendency.

For if the Love of God must be thus perfect and entire, so as to be exclusive of all Creatures, what room can then be left for the Love of our Neighbour? To this the Answer is very easie and very clear. If our Love to God and our Neighbour were of the same kind, the entire Love of the former would indeed wholly exclude that of the later. But this is not the Case. We are not here supposed to love God in the same sense, or with the same sort of Love wherewith we love our Neighbour. We do not love God by wishing any Good to him (whereof he is not capable) but by wishing him as a Good to our selves. On the contrary, we do not, or at least should not love our Neighbour by wishing him as a Good to our selves, (for he is not our Good) but by wishing Good to him. That is in short, we love God with the love of Desire, and we love our Neighbour with the Love of Benevolence or Charity. But now the entire Desire of God is very consistent with all manner of Benevolence to our Neighbour. It does indeed wholly exclude all love of Desire towards him.

What may I not love this or that delicate Fruit, or this or that rich Wine? May not I love what delights my Palate, and yields me pleasure? Yes, if Bodies were the true Causes of your pleasure, you might, nay you ought to love them, as being upon that supposition your proper Good. But this is the very thing they are defective in; we have clear and incontestable Reasonto assure us, that they are not the true real Causes of any of our Sensations. But however, there is Pleasure, you'll say, annex'd to them; for we feel Pleasure in the Use of such and such sensible things. True, we do so, but the most that ought to be concluded from hence is, that we may seek and use these sensible things, to which by the Order and Institution of Nature, Pleasure is annex'd: As on the contrary, that we are to shun and avoid those sensible things to which is annex'd the opposite Sentiment of Pain. But it will not hence follow, that either the former is to be loved, or the later to be fear'd. 'Tis true indeed, that Pleasure it self is always lovely, and so is the true Cause of it. We must love whatever is able to cause Pleasure in us, and in whose power it is to make us Happy. But then we must take heed lest we mistake that for the true Efficient Cause which is only the Occasion; lest we attribute our Sensations to Bodies as their proper Effect, to the production of which they serve only as Positive Conditions, determning the Operation of God, the only true Efficient Cause. So much indeed must be allow'd them, but our Reason will not suffer us to allow them any more; and though in regard that they do so much they may be innocently sought for and used, yet because they do no more, they must not be loved. As we must love the Efficient Cause of our Pleasure, so we may seek after, and make use of that which is the Occasion of it; but this is all, we must not advance one step higher, for we have no Warrant beyond this. So that though I may eat of a pleasant Fruit, and enjoy Pleasure in the use of it, yet I must not make it the object of my Love; I must not place any degree of Affection upon it. I am to remember, that though in the Eating of this Fruit I find my self delighted, yet this Pleasure is neither in the Fruit it self, nor from it, but that 'tis God that raises this grateful Sentiment in my Soul, and accordingly I am thankfully and devoutly to acknowledge and reverence his Divine Operation, and to Love him all the while I use and enjoy the other.

So indeed it is said by some, who think they strain the Love of God to a very high Pitch, when they tell us, that we must love nothing but God, or in Order and Relation to God. So then, according to these Men, we are allow'd to love Creatures, provided it be in a way of Relation and Subordination to God, who upon this Principle is not to be the Only, but only the Final and Ultimate Object of our Love. But methinks these Men's Relative Love is very much like the Relative Worship of the Papists. They make God the only ultimate Object of all Divine Worship; and so fo these Men make him the only last Object of Love: But yet they allow of giving Divine Worship to a Creature, provided it be in a transitive and relative way; that is, provided it only pass through the Creature, and terminate upon God. And so these Men allow of bestowing our Love upon a Creature, provided it be for God's sake, or in relation to God, provided it do not stop and rest at the Creature, but run on, till at last it fix upon God as its final Object. The Notions are exactly Parallel to each other, and they both shew how extreamly loath Men are to take a final leave of the Creature, to disengage intirely from sensible things. They cannot be perfectly wean'd from what they do dearly affect, and therefore would fain contrive the matter so, as in the midst of all their Love and Devotion to God, to have still some Reserve for the Creature; to maintain some little under-Current of Religion and Affection for sensible things, which they would still have leave to Worship and Love, though it be never so remotely and indirectly, though it be but in a Relative way. This I take to be the true Ground and Bottom of both these Notions, the Common Disease of our Nature, the great Propensity of the Soul to sensible things, which makes Men still willing to allow them a share both in their Religion and in their Affection; and that they might do it with the better Colour, has put them upon finding out this Notable Distinction of a Relative Worship, and of a Relative Love. And truly I think one is as good as the other; that we may as well Worship the Creature with a Relative Worship, as well as Love the Creature with a Relative Love. For 'tis plain that this later Distinction does as much suppose that God only is the proper Object of Love, as the other does suppose that he is the only proper object of Worship, otherwise what need this Qualification of our Love to the Creature that it be Relative? Well, but if so, then as to worship the Creature though but Relatively, is to give that Worship to the Creature which is proper to God; so to love the Creature though but Relatively, is in like manner to give that Love to the Creature which is proper to God. And if this be thought a sufficient Reason to disallow of a Relative Worship, I cannot see why we should not for the ver same Reason give Sentence against this Relative Love, or why one should not be reckon'd Idolatry as well as the other. But to bring this Matter to a compendious Issue, the short is this; either Creatures are truly and really lovely, as being our true and proper Good, or they are not. If they are, then a Relative Love is too little, we ought to love them with more than a Relative Love, we ought to love them Absolutely and for themselves. But if they are not (as by a Light as clear as Day it appears they are not) then even a Relative Love is too much. For what is not truly lovely, is always loved too much if it be loved at all. So that either way there is no Pretence for admitting this last expedient of our Concupiscence, the Relative Love of the Creature. And thus all the Doors and Avenues or the Heart of Man are shut fast and bolted against the Creatures, who are now all banish'd from this Seat of Love, and God only left in Possession there.","subId":"58","id":"Norris.PD.3.1.58"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Thus it is in Theory, but oh when will it be thus in Practice?

Wonderful Stupidity, as well as Impiety, to love that beyond and more than God, which we are not so much as to love at all!

Who would ever think it possible that the Great God should be thus out-rivall'd by his Creatures? But the misery of it is, as we live by Sense, so we love also by Sense. We dwell in Matter, and we are inviron'd all round with Matter, so that we cannot get through the Croud and Throng of Creatures to come at our God. The Creatures do so press upon us, and so continually court our Love by addressing themselves to all our Senses, that we cannot deny their importunity. They also have the advantage of being the only Objects of our Sight, for none shall see me and live, saith God. Let us enlarge our Prospect never so far and wide, we see nothing but Creatures. In them our Prospect begins, and in them it terminates. They also have the Priviledge to stand before us and look us, as it were, in the Face whenever we feel Pleasure or Pain; and 'tis at their Impression that we ordinarily have these Sentiments, which imposes upon our Imaginations, making us apt to look upon them as the Causes of our Good and of our Evil, and accordingly as the proper Objects of our love, and of our Fear; and all because we have our Sensations at their Presence and upon their Impression, while in the mean while God, who is the true Cause, appears not in view, but hides himself from us, and acts his part behind a Cloud. But were our Eyes once open'd, could we but see how absolutely and intirely we depend upon God both for our Being and for the whole Perfection of it, for all that we are, have or enjoy; how he alone acts in us, and causes our Sensations; how he inlightens our Understandings with his Light, warms our Wills with his Love, and refreshes our Souls with his Pleasure, while in the mean time all the Creatures stand mute and silent before him, and like so many Cyphers in his Presence, having not the least Activity or Operation upon our Spirits; I say, could we have such a Scene as this before us, we should quickly dismiss the whole Creation from our Hearts, and be wholly possess'd and swallow'd up with the Love of God.
